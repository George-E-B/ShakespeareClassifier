There was no telling how old she was ( it would be discourteous to ask ) , but she could remember olden times better than what had gone on the day before . When she was Hannah 's age , she cooked in an open fireplace , baking her potatoes in the ashes and simmering           over the flames . At the market she either bartered or paid in pounds and pence . Her husband fought the British and even now she had nightmares about redcoats attacking and burning farms . Her husband , long since dead , had built that house with his naval pay at the end of the War . He and his sons cleared something like 40 acres-from the sea right up to the town road , tree by tree , stump by stump . Of her four sons and a daughter , all but two died the same week in a diphtheria epidemic . Mr. Bates and the half wit were the survivors . With so few to work the fields , they sold all but ten acres . Still , she never complained . She made Hannah feel lucky to have been born when she was .", 'For two years Hannah worked her share with quiet satisfaction           tasks : Mondays for washing , Tuesday ironing , Wednesdays lamp cleaning , Thursday baking , Friday for firewood , Saturday for mending . Each Sabbath was marked by church for the length of the morning and then the big noonday meal . It was a pleasure to have him home for that . Her schedule was unrelenting , but no more so than his , no more so than wives she sometimes spoke with at the general store , a few with brutish husbands .', 'As soon as Hannah was through washing and drying the supper dishes and mopping the floor , they would gather around the diningroom table for a reading . Even Mrs. B. was wheeled in for that , bundled up in blankets and robes . Her favorite was The Book of Homilies           from Pilgrim \'s Progress . Such wonderful adventures ! She also liked selections from the family Bible , especially tales like " The Book of Ruth " and " Esther . " She had mixed feelings about the poetical passages from the " Song of Songs . " Such exotic images ; such deep feelings ! She had never heard them read in church and could hardly believe they were Scriptures , but Mr. Bates \'s voice never varied from his sonorous tone and measured beat , so they must be acceptable . It was strange indeed how they wove themselves into her dreams .', 'Then Mrs. B. died . A week of constricted breathing , two visits from a doctor who bled her with leeches and dispensed unmarked medications from a black bag , a night of moaning , and then death . Not even a name for the malady . Just age , Hannah concluded . It was bound to come , she reminded herself , but not for a moment had she allowed herself to expect it .', 'Hannah too was overwhelmed , but it was hard to separate her grief from the fear of what would become of her . She wrote her mother the morning after the death , trying to describe both her love for Mrs. B. and her concern for her future .', "After the           . It was run by the women of the church at the parsonage . Hannah did her best to remain invisible . Her mother 's insistence not withstanding , Hannah was taken in the village as Mr. Bates ' hired girl , and she preferred it this way . She would have been flustered and tongue-tied if anyone had taken her for Idn and offered her condolences .", "Back home she set herself to scrubbing her rags that had been in soak , a distasteful task that came once a month . She rubbed in a frenzy , but she could n't wipe out the anxiety           wall in front of her . No , she told herself : It simply was n't right , her staying there with a bachelor no matter what his age . And he was n't making it easy by brooding in his room , refusing to tell her what must be said . Prolonging the agony . If a boil must be lanced , she told herself , ' t is best to do it quickly . If not by him , then by her .", 'She wished she could simply write a note to Mr. Bates and slip away . A brief and courteous note . She would thank him for his kindness . She would ask him to tell Solomon that she " went away " like his mother . How else would Solomon understand ? Such messages were easier on paper . But no , she could n\'t do that . It would take a day to walk to Codman even if she did n\'t have the trunk . She would have to ask Mr. Bates to hitch up the buckboard .', '" Hannah ! "', '" Mr. Bates , " she called , going to him , " I was wondering if you would hitch up Nell . "', '" Not ill , no . " She paused , furious at him for making her say it . " It \'s time for me to leave . "', 'She felt like stamping her foot .', '" Not necessarily . "', '" Well , I \'ve been thinking . Thinking a lot . "', '" This is when I think the best . As you know , my brother needs a bit of mothering . He \'s very fond of you . And the place needs a woman \'s care . And cheer . I thought perhaps you \'d stay . "', '" I           Mrs. Bates . "', '" Marriage ? " she said finally . " With meP " He nodded . " Why Mr. Bates , you \'re . . . I mean , I \'m barely of age . "', '" You would n\'t be joking now , would you , Mr. Bates ? "', 'She opened her mouth in astonishment . Like an idiot , she was speechless . Bewildered , overcome , she ran for the house .', 'With the scene came doubt . Had that truly been a proposal of marriage ? Could she have dreamed the scene with such detail ? He had not mentioned it at dinner nor all evening . She had gone to bed beginning to wonder if she had invented it ; now in the chill of the morning it seemed even more fanciful .', 'And what should Hannah herself make of it ? In some ways it might not be so different from the life she had been leading , but then , surely , there would be what her mother called " wifely obligations " -a dark , ominous subject . Or would he let her stay in her little room ?', '"          ', 'She plunged into a flurry of kitchen-cleaning , speaking to Solomon with a harshness that startled her .', 'He looked at her with alarm . " Be quick about it , " he repeated , but he did not move .', '" Hannah , " he said , " you \'d best put some water on to boil . And dress Solomon in his church suit . We \'re going to have company for tea . "', '" An hour , give or take . "', '" Two , " Mr. Bates shouted without opening the door . " The minister and his wife . "', 'By the time the Reverend Mr. Crooker and his wife arrived , Hannah was as tense as a schoolgirl at test time . Still uncertain about her status , she stood awkwardly at the door between the parlor arid the hallway-close enough to nudge Solomon if he should forget to stand and shake hands , yet far enough , she hoped , so as not to be included           she were acting like some Irish country girl-exactly what her mother warned her against .', "The reverend had graduated from a seminary in Boston and was generally regarded to be as learned as a judge . You could tell that from his sermons which were long and incomprehensible . To Hannah 's surprise , however , the conversation turned out to be perfectly ordinary . No complicated talk about the nature of the Elect , the attributes of the Holy Ghost , or the terrible subtlety of unintentional sin . No different , really , from idle talk with the grocer or with women she met at the store .", '" Wo n\'t you join us , Miss Farr ? " The question , coming from the minister , was an order . Without thinking she dropped just a suggestion of a curtsey and sat on the footstool nearest the door . If only she had retreated to the kitchen before he had spotted her !', 'Hannah felt a blush rise to her face . What on earth had Mr. Bates said ?', '" Mr. Bates would n\'t agree . He says you were a blessing during his mother \'s final days . "', '" He has the highest regard for you . It appears he has made a . . . . " The minister faltered . " Made a . . . . " He cleared his throat . " He would have discussed this with your father , but Mr. Farr is , ah , deceased , is he not ? " She nodded . " Ah yes . A pity . " He paused . " And you are now ? "', '" How old ? "', '" Ah yes . Eighteen . Well , there are scriptural precedents that I have explained to Mr. Bates . Clear scriptural precedents . "', '" A question ? "', 'Clouds of uncertainty lifted from Hannah . She took a deep breath . " Oh no , it is I who was left hanging . No . I mean yes . Oh dear yes . "', "Hannah 's mother agreed to the match by letter , excusing herself from the arrangements because of distance . So even the wedding itself was prepared by Mrs. Crooker . On the day of the wedding , Hannah 's mother and two brothers came to the service in an undertaker 's hired carriage , the cheapest in town . The brothers , looking hot and surly in their Sunday suits , might well have been going to a funeral . But they behaved themselves . One would hardly know how loutish they could be at home . Hannah 's mother seemed stiff and defensive . For some reason she had to tell everyone that Hannah 's father had been a lawyer .", 'Only one hurdle remained . On their silent way back from the village in the old buckboard , Hannah brooded once again about what her mother called " conjugal obligations . " Could this be akin to what dogs do ?', 'These were , surely , just wanderings of a mind lulled by sleep . Still , there was something about them that left her restless and uneasy . Were such dreams what the reverend called an unintentional sin ?', "Or almost . The minister had           perform the final act , the consummation . Without that , a marriage could be annulled , could n't itP If she could just endure the first night , put it behind her , perhaps then she , Mr. Bates , and Solomon could return to the quiet , private life they had shared and treasured .", '" I \'d best do some readying up , " she said , avoiding Mr. Bates \' eyes . " There \'s cleaning to do regardless . "', '" Well now , Mr. Bates , will you be wanting supper at the usual time ? "', 'He looked at her with a shy smile-kindly and somehow apologetic too . It was the face of a man flooded with things to say but unable to uncork the words .', '" Wind \'s veered into the east , " he said , speaking to them both but looking at neither of them . " Looks like a line storm . Early in           shook his head . " Should have hauled traps this morning . Except we were busy . "', "Back in the living room , she saw Mr. Bates was reading last week 's Codman Courier in the fading light . She lit a lamp for him , but he made no move to get a book for reading aloud . She took up her darning . In the silence she heard the wind begin to moan around the comer of the house and rattle the doors .", '" I suppose .

" Shall I wait up there for your "', "Lighting a candle with a taper , she went upstairs . In the darkened hallway she peered into his room . It was stark , ' unadorned . The downstairs room that his mother had occupied for so many years would have been more inviting . It still had a woman 's touch -- curtains , a rug , and a framed etching of a cow in a meadow . But he would not sleep in his mother 's bed ; she knew that without asking . As she stared at his iron bed , shadows trembling in the candlelight , she heard the beginning of rain on the roof .", 'Then , the sound of steps . Measured , heavy , echoing her girlhood dreams-the giant mounting the stairs toward her . Fee , fi , fo , fum ! I smell the blood of an Englishmun . It was her blood he smelled . She squirmed to the far edge of the bed , facing the wall , her breath shallow . When the latch lifted and the door creaked open , she squeezed her eyes shut .', '" Hannah ? " He spoke softly-not at all a giant \'s voice .', '" Not asleep ? "', 'He slid into bed and lay there on his back , not touching her .', '" Strange for me too . "', '" I wanted to do you proud . "', '" I guess so . "', '" Elijah ? A bit churlish , perhaps . "', '" Oh Saul ! " she said , flipping herself over , looking down on him now , stroking his face . " But I did n\'t . Would           Saul . " There it was-she was using his first name without asking . " Do n\'t ever think like that . Ever . " Without thinking she kissed him the way she would Solomon when he was hurt , and then she kissed him again , longer . " My Saul , " she murmured . Their arms were around each other as she kissed his weathered neck .', 'Fiercely she rolled him over on top of her , gripping him . " Hannah , " he said           for fear that words would bog them down . She grabbed his shoulder , tugging . It was all grunt and heave now , but she would not let go . Come on , she said silently , I do n\'t like this either .', 'Suddenly he cried out . Then he was still . A great weight on her , breathing hard . That must be the end of it . Strange , lying there , pain stabbing in her , wondering why she was not appalled . Hurting , unmistakably cut , wet , perhaps bleeding , yet inexplicably wanting to keep rocking , to keep it sliding-like some terrible insect bite , already scratched bloody but still needing to be scratched . She lay           slightly , tilting her lower body imperceptibly up and down in spite of the pain .', 'But what a mess ! Was she bleeding or was all that wet from him From the slippery feeling , there must be blood . How would she ever get the stains out of the sheets ? And the mattress ? It would be marked forever , a reminder . If this was to be repeated , she must remember to keep clean rags by the bed . She stood up , trying to wipe herself with her nightdress . That too would have to be soaked in cold water and then boiled with lye .', 'In the blue light of another flash she saw him at the open door of her former room , a sad , ghostly form in his nightshirt , sleeping cap askew .', 'She led him back to his room , her arm around him , feeling her way along the wall . She helped him into bed and tucked in the covers . Then she kissed him goodnight . " Everything \'s all right now , " she said .', '" You           And you ? "', "She thought he would sleep , but his hand began grazing her face . Soon it was traveling down her neck and across her breast . She could see that they would not be sleeping for a while yet . Well , she thought , it 's all right . This is what men and women do together . This is the secret they share .", 'THE FIELD REPRESENTATIVE of the demon showed up exactly thirty days before Pete Whitlock \'s fifty-fifth birthday . He assumed human form for the visit , appearing as a handsome , tanned young man in his late twenties . " How you doing , Pete ? " he inquired just after materializing in the doorway of Pete \'s den at a few minutes after two on an overcast afternoon in late October . Pete had been hunched at his computer keyboard , trying to beef up his resume . " I \'ve decided not to sell , " he told the young man , looking up . " So if you \'re with one of the Realtors who           " " Name \'s Chip Willis . " The demon \'s rep held out a completely believable hand . " I \'m not in real estate . " Getting up , Pete shook hands . " From the bank ? They mentioned they were going to send somebody over about the equity loan , " he said . " See , I \'ve decided to keep the house for a while , borrow on it and hold on until I get the new advertising job I \'m waiting for . " " Good plan , Pete . " Willis settled into the big brown armchair . " Wo n\'t make much difference in the long haul , but you may as well go out hopefully . " Frowning , Pete asked , " You are n\'t from the bank ? " " hope , but it \'s a natural mistake . " Willis smiled broadly . " I \'ve got myself rigged to suggest something like that - sincerity , financial stability . Could be a lawyer , maybe an accountant . You know , someone people will trust ,           hell are you then ? Why did you walk right into my house ? " " Did n\'t walk in , sport , " corrected the smiling Willis . " I materialized . You must \'ve heard the faint popping sound . It \'s caused by the displacement of - " " Great , wonderful . I do n\'t have enough problems . Now I have a lunatic prowling my - " " Keep cool , there \'s no problem . I \'m not a loon , a serial killer or any other common suburban bugaboo . " " Go away , " suggested Pete . " If you \'re a burglar , I have to tell you right off that - " " Not a burglar either , no . " His smile broadened . " Well , what say we get down to business ? " " What business ? I do n\'t , far as I know , have any impending business at all with a lunatic . " " Hey ; Pete , you \'re not paying close enough attention here . Did n\'t I just           listen to me now . " A briefcase appeared suddenly on his lap , a brand new one made of real black leather . " Sorry , I forgot this . " Pete dropped down into his desk chair , turning to face Willis . " How \'d you do that ? " " Impressive , huh ? It \'s black magic . " He unfastened the black case , reached inside . " But you ought to know all about that . " " All about black magic ? Listen , Mr. Willis , I think maybe you - " " Call me Chip . " " Chip , I \'m commencing to think that you \'ve got the wrong Peter Whitlock , " he told him . " Maybe , you know , you want some other Peter Whitlock . Peter J. Whitlock , say , or Peter F. Whitlock or maybe - " " No , you \'re my boy , Pete . " He extracted a rolled sheet of parchment . It was tied with a faded twist of red ribbon . " You remember this           ca n\'t say I do . What is it ? " Willis tapped his knee with the rolled parchment . " Let me refresh your memory , " he offered . " Frisco . Thirty years ago . Well , thirty years less thirty days ago actually . " " Thirty years ago I was living out in San Francisco , yeah , " he admitted , becoming aware of some twisting pains beginning deep in his stomach . " That was my first advertising job , with Arnold &; Maxwell . I started there as a copywriter just before my twenty-fifth birthday . But I do n\'t see what that has to do with - " " It was there you began your impressive meteoric rise to success in your chosen profession . " " Meteoric ? " Pete laughed ruefully . " I \'ve been out of work for nearly five months . I never rose above copywriter with any of the five agencies I \'ve worked with over the years . I \'m living here in New Beckford , Connecticut , in a house that \'s dropped           paying two vicious and vindictive former wives alimony and the last award I won was for some HoundDog Puppy Treat trade ads back in 1988 . " He shook his head slowly . " Success ? You \'ve definitely got the wrong Peter Whitlock , Chip . " " Let me clarify something , " offered Willis , a trace of impatience sounding in his voice . " Because , see , lots of people I come to collect from try similar dodges . But , the point is , success is relative and everybody ca n\'t become a flapping billionaire . Even the most powerful demon in the netherworld ca n\'t go around turning everybody into a millionaire . Hell , that \'d futz up the economy worse than it is already . " " Collect ? What did you come to collect ? " " We \'ll get to that in a minute . " " And what was that reference to demons ? " " Oh , c\'m on - are you pretending you never heard of Shug Nrgyzb ? " Pete scowled at his visitor .           who I work for . " " Not a very catchy name for a company . " " Shug Nrgyzb is n\'t a company or a product , Pete . He \'s a demon , " explained Willis , waving the parchment . " A truly powerful one . " " You \'re claiming you work for a demon ? " " I do work for a demon . " " You really are a loon . You \'d just better leave my - " " Whoa , whoa . Pete , I do n\'t have all that much time to waste . " Untying the ribbon , he unfurled the parchment . " The bottom line here is that you made a deal with Shug Nrgyzb thirty years back and now the time has come to settle the - " " I never heard of him until just this minute , " insisted Pete as he stood up again . " It \'s not the sort of name you \'d forget . And , trust me , if I \'d made any deal with a demon , granting that           I would sure as hell remember it . " Willis shook his head . " Been tried , pal . " " What \'s been tried ? " " Stupidity defense . \' I was too dense to know what I was doing . " Never works , not ever , " the rep assured him . " Possibly in a court of law you could pull something like that and have a chance . But , hey , none of that cuts any ice with a demon . " Pete sat .. " You \'re claiming that thirty years ago out in San Francisco I made some kind of deal with this Shug Nrgyzb ? " " You are n\'t pronouncing Nrgyzb right , Pete . It \'s Nrgyzb . " " Be that as it may , Chip - What was this deal I allegedly made ? " " In exchange for thirty years of uninterrupted success , you agree to- " " You call what I \'ve lived through for the past thirty years uninterrupted success ? Do you have anything in your files on Mary Jo           " How can any man who was married to Mary Jo for ten long , bleak years be considered a success ? " " You continue to miss the point , Pete . If you had n\'t , see , made the deal things would \'ve been even worse , " the rep told him . " Success for a schlep like you does n\'t involve sitting on top of the world for three decades . Nope , it means rather that you - " " And then there was Mary Jane , my second wife . " " Were you aware that you have a tendency to marry women with similar names ? " " Yeah . But tell me what could have been worse than seven years with Mary Jane ? " " Seven more with Mary Jo . It \'s all , I keep trying to convince you , relative . Believe me-you \'ve had a much better life than you deserved . " " Do you know what my current bank balance is ? " " Checking or savings ? " " Savings . " "           in Fairfield County . People hereabouts give 611,426 to their cleaning ladies as a Christmas bonus , they often drop $11,426 into a homeless beggar \'s Styrofoam cup , they toss $11,426 to their kids for pocket money . $11,426 , believe me , is not a fortune . It sure as hell is not an impressive amount to have to show for thirty damn years of wild success . " " For a born loser like you , Pete , it \'s about $10,000 more than you deserve . " He rattled the parchment , at the same time making an impatient noise . " Back to the business at hand . It \'s our policy , as you know , to call on our clients thirty days in advance of the collection date . That way , Pete , you have time to put your affairs in order , maybe arrange a farewell party , do those things you \'ve always been meaning to do and , being such a schlep , never got around to doing . " " Wait now . " He was on his           business where you come to collect my soul ? " " No , it is not , nope . " Willis grinned . " All Shug Nrgyzb wants is your life . " " Life ? " " On your fifty-fifth birthday he \'ll appear and devour you . " Pete sank , slowly , back into his desk chair . " What exactly does being devoured by Shug Nrgyzb involve ? " " Painless really . Being as how he \'s on the large side , he can devour the average person in two bites . Three tops , " promised Willis . " Some folks get panicky when they witness the flames and smoke that accompany a manifestation of Shug Nrgyzb , but that \'s all for show . You might , possibly , experience a few first degree burns , but you \'ll only be alive for a few seconds after that anyway . " " Listen , Chip , I never made any deal with this guy , " insisted Pete . " So it really does n\'t seem fair , particularly since I never actually           to come and devour me . I \'m sure that if you point out the mistake to him , he \'ll be only too glad to - " " Actually , Shug Nrgyzb has a reputation for being a real shit , Pete , " Willis pointed out . " He could drop by and devour you merely for the fun of it . Yet that \'s a moot point , since you did actually sign this document . " He paused , scanning the parchment . " Oops . " " Ha ! It is n\'t me you want at all , is it ? " " Oh , it \'s you sure enough . No doubt about that , Pete . " He held out the parchment . " You see , the way this works is that the party who enjoys the success is the one who has to pay the piper . In this particular instance , however , you did n\'t personally sign yourself up for the thirty year success package . That was - " " Jennifer Windmiller . " He \'d grabbed the           bottom . " Old girlfriend of yours , as I understand it . " " Jennifer Windmiller , " Pete repeated softly as he let the parchment drop to the carpet . " I have n\'t thought of her for years . " Willis rose up , smoothing his trousers . " Well , you owe all the great things that have happened to you during your adult life to that little lady , " he said , smiling . " We wo n\'t see each other again , but it \'s been nice meeting you . Oh , and do n\'t try to run when Shug Nrgyzb shows up to collect . That would only make him madder and he \'d probably devour you in smaller bites . " There was a faint popping noise as Willis , his briefcase and the parchment all vanished . ZORINA TASHLIN reached across the desk to brush at his left coat sleeve . " Lint , " the thin dark woman mentioned . " Perhaps your long stretch of unemployment , Peter , is due as much to your slovenly appearance as           qualify me as a slob , " he countered . " But let \'s get back to my latest problem . " She picked up her pencil , set it down an inch to the right of where it had been . " I \'m a career consultant , not a therapist . " " No , no , I \'m not cracking up , " he assured her . " It \'s simply that I seem to be mixed up , through no fault of my own , with a vindictive demon . " " Perhaps if you accepted responsibility for your problems , you\'d- " " The reason I came by this afternoon , Zorina , is that I need some advice about how to - " " If you honestly believe that this old sweetheart of , yours has put a curse on you , then she \'s the one you must talk to . " " It \'s not exactly a curse , it was supposed to be a boon . Thirty years of ongoing achievement , except it did n\'t turn out quite that way           like Jennifer Windmiller ? " " Why do n\'t you simply contact her , Peter ? " " I tried that , soon as the demon \'s advance man vanished , " he answered . " Trouble is , she \'s not listed anywhere in the San Francisco Bay Area , not according to phone information . And I used the Net every way I could think of and did n\'t find one damn trace of her . " " Probably she \'s married . " " Maybe , more than once . I do n\'t have any idea , however , what her name is these days . " " Finding lost loves is not part of my service . But a good private investigator might be able to - " " That will take too long , " he cut in . " But you advise a lot of people on career changes , help them find new jobs . Do you know anybody who specializes in occult stuff ? I want to approach the problem from the demon angle , but unfortunately there \'s nothing like an           , Zorina gazed out the office window at the gray late afternoon parking lot . " Well , I suppose there is Batsford . " " What does he do ? " " Mostly Batsford fouls up the job interviews I send him out on , " she said , picking up the pencil again . " He maintains that , in addition to being a second rate accountant , he \'s an investigator of the supernatural . Mind you , Peter , 1 ca n\'t vouch for the validity of such a claim . " " Basically I need someone who \'s knowledgeable about warding off demons . Or at least stalling them for a while . " " Check with Batsford . " She wrote an address on a memo slip . " His phone \'s not in service at the moment . And do n\'t , by the way , give him any cash in advance . He has a tendency to go off on sprees . " Taking the slip , Pete studied the address before folding it and inserting it in his shirt pocket .           new for me in the way of a job ? " " I hesitate to send you out on any more interviews , Peter , if you plan to be eaten by a demon in a month \'s time . " " If Batsford is any good at all , I \'ll have longer than that . " " You \'ll have to guarantee me you \'re going to be alive for at least a year . " " C\'m on , that \'s not fair , Zorina . Nobody can guarantee you that they \'ll live another year . " " That \'s true , yes , but none of my other clients has a fiend from the netherworld breathing down his or her neck . " " What about that copywriting job for Help-A-Tot ? You mentioned there might be an opening there about now . " " It \'s beneath you , Peter . " " Five months I \'ve been out of work . " " I was n\'t aware of the exact nature of the position when I brought it up the other day .           the desk . " Help-A-Tot collects money for underprivileged children around the world . Each child is supposed to write a letter to his or her individual sponsor every three months . Alas , Help-A-Tot is n\'t as aboveboard about those letters as I was originally led to believe . It turns out they \'re faked , all written by the same person and then mailed by stringers across the globe . The Help-A-Tot copywriter is the person who has to crank out those fraudulent missives . It \'s disgusting . " " Disgusting , " he agreed . " But what does it pay ? " She rose up , carefully , frowning . " Clean up this demon mess first , " she advised . " Then we can talk jobs again , Peter . " " That \'s not a crystal ball , " observed Pete . " Yes , it is . " " Looks like a fishbowl to me . " " If it were a fishbowl , my skeptical chum , there \'d be a myriad of colorful little fish flitting around inside it           upside down , so all the fish would \'ve dribbled out long since . " " Who \'s the occult expert , my boy - you or I ? " " Well , Zorina claims that you are , though I \'m starting to have - " " And how much am I charging you for this entire lengthy session ? " " Fifty dollars . " " That \'s an incredibly low fee , my boy , considering that you \'re getting my exclusive and undivided services . " He was a small , rumpled man in his middle forties , wearing a double-breasted blue suit and a white sweatshirt . The questionable crystal ball rested on a card table in the center of the small , cluttered living room of his second-floor apartment . " I \'m skeptical that any of this , " admitted Pete , who was sitting opposite the mystic , " is going to work . " " I must have silence while I \'m trying to tune in on the supernatural realms . " " Is that what you \'re supposed to be           warding off a demon ? " Batsford scratched at his left armpit . " I may go off into a trance any time now , " he warned . " Should I say nothing for a full five minutes , my boy , reach across and give me a hearty nudge . Trances sometimes , unfortunately , segue into naps . " He placed his stubby hands , fingers spread wide , on each side of the upended fishbowl . " Om mani padme hum . " A loud thumping sounded in the dimlit room . " Is that , " inquired Pete , " something mystical ? " " Merely the young marrieds upstairs wrestling with each other . Ignore it . " Batsford shut his eyes . " Om mani padme hum . " The crystal ball began to glow with a pale yellow light . A tiny figure appeared within it . Leaning forward , squinting at the image , Pete exclaimed , " Hey , that \'s Jenny Windmiller . Except she looks exactly as she did when I was dating her out in San Francisco           . " " There \'s sometimes a little fine tuning that has to be done , " said Batsford in a gruffer voice . " Let \'s fast forward to the present . " Jennifer went through a series of changes , her slim figure growing gradually plumper and her dark hair undergoing various style changes and ending up short-cropped and gray . Her clothes changed , too , and finally she appeared within the globe clad in a full-length fur coat . " That ca n\'t be her . " " Time has a tendency to blur the - " " No , I mean she \'s a vegetarian . A fur coat - looks like mink , does n\'t it ? - is something Jenny \'d never put on . " " Ah - ah . " Batsford suddenly slumped in his folding chair . His voice shifted again and he began talking in a piping falsetto . " Her name now is Jennifer Sanson . She resides in Santa Morgana , California . " " That \'s over in Marin County , across the Bay from San           " Can you give me an address and a phone number ? " " Look it up in the directory , schmuck , " the piping voice advised him . " It \'s possible she can re-negotiate the contract with Shug Nrgyzb , although she has n\'t practiced any black magic for many a ... " Sighing , Batsford came toppling forward . His head whacked the fish bowl , sending it hopping off the table . Pete lunged , caught it before it smacked the bare hardwood . It felt extremely hot in his hands . " Nice catch . " Batsford had his own voice once more . He was sitting up , rubbing at his eyes . " Did we find out anything ? " " Do n\'t you know ? " He shook his shaggy head . " I was in a trance during the best parts . Did we ? " " According to you , Jennifer is now - " " Not according to me , my boy . According , rather , to one of my valuable controls . Was it a kindly           Mouse . " " Ah , that \'s Little Eva . A sweet child , though a mite salty . " " Is she reliable ? " " Almost always , yes . " " Well , she claims Jenny is now a Mrs. Sanson and residing in Northern California . " " You can put your faith in Little Eva , bless her . " " Okay , I \'ll check with information and get Jennifer \'s phone number , " said Pete , getting up . " I \'ll phone her and tell her to do something to call off Shug Nrgyzb . " " You must go out there in person . " Standing , Batsford scratched at his backside . " What do you mean ? " " Eh ? " " You told me I have to go out there to California . " When Batsford frowned , new wrinkles joined those already crowding together on his pale forehead . " What sort of voice did I use ? " " Sounded like your own . " " Ah , that must be Mr. Dennison           me . " He rubbed at his stubbly chin several times , slowly . " I \'d heed Dennison were I you . He has an impressive track record in this sort of thing . " " Look , if Jennifer is still capable of calling off this demon , she does n\'t need me out there . With my finances the way they are , a trip West would be- " " It \'s essential that you confront her face to face , " cried Batsford in Little Eva \'s voice . " And , please , take nice Mr. Batsford along for occult protection . " He blinked , shook his head . " Who spoke to you this time ? " Pete eyed him . " Have you been wishing for a vacation out in California ? " " No , absolutely not . I loathe the place . Far too much sunshine and the whole state is due to fall into the sea any day now . Hate California , my boy . " Pete shook his head . " Never mind , thanks for your           I \'ll get in touch with Jennifer and-Hey ! " Several drops of warm water had smacked him on the head . He glanced upwards . " Couple upstairs ? " " After they grapple , they take a shower together . " He shuffled across the room to open the door . " Let me know when we \'re leaving for the Coast . " Three nights later Pete was getting wet on a rainswept hillside in Santa Morgana , California . Far below , beyond the houses and the wooded acres , the San Francisco Bay showed blurred and black . The lights of the restaurants and the docked boats of this little bayside town glowed fuzzily . Pete was standing beside their rented car , shining a flashlight at the silent engine . " Why am I doing this ? " he asked . " I do n\'t know a damn thing about automobiles . " " Does n\'t look too complicated , my boy , " observed Batsford , who was hunched next to him and using a steepled copy of the San Francisco Chronicle as           are you ? Could n\'t you or one of those pixies you claim you \'re in communication with have foreseen this ? " " Spirits , " corrected the occult consultant . " I get most of my psychic help from the ghosts of the departed who - nertz to you , kiddo . " The last phrase came out in a falsetto . " Now , now , Little Eva . " " Why in the hell did n\'t somebody like Little Eva predict that this car we rented was going to break down ? " " I did mention at the time , " reminded Batsford , " that a firm calling itself the Rockbottom Cheap Car Rental Agency might not deal in the most reliable of vehicles . " " We \'re on a very tight budget , " Pete told him as he probed with the beam of the flash . " Having to pay your way out here means I ca n\'t go first cabin on everything . Is that red wire supposed to be dangling there ? " " That looks more like a           this rattletrap was snacking whilst he - " " Jinxed . This whole venture is jinxed , " lamented Pete . " If only I \'d been able to talk to Jennifer on the phone I could \'ve avoided this entire trip - and the cost . " " It occurs to me that her husband \'s refusal to allow you telephone access to the lady is highly suspicious . " " He said she was down with the flu . Not a very cordial guy from the sound of him . " " Contractors are usually aggressive burly types . Besides , you called the house something like a dozen times demanding to speak to her . " " Listen , Batsford , I \'m going to be devoured by this demon in twentyseven days . That would make anybody anxious and uneasy . " " Whap the carburetor , " advised the mystic in a vaguely Germanic voice . " We \'ll fix der dodgosted thing dot way . " " Hum ? " Batsford blinked . " Did I speak ? " " You told me to           " " Oh , that was Mr. O\'Riley . For some reason , it amuses him to pretend he \'s a Nordic type , " explained Batsford as the rain pelted down on his newspaper . " During his lifetime , he worked in a garage in Minneapolis . It would n\'t hurt to heed his advice . " Sighing , Pete leaned further under the raised hood and fisted something he was nearly certain was the carburetor . The engine returned to life . Pete waited for a few seconds , grinned , shut the hood and jumped back in the driver \'s seat . " C\'m on , let \'s go . " WHEN PETE stepped into the second-floor bedroom off the rainswept balcony , Jennifer said , " You \'re getting mud all over the carpet , Peter . " " Same old Jenny , " he said . " You husband \'s locked you in here and I , after coming westward from distant Connecticut at considerable expense , have just climbed up a very rickety drain pipe to rescue you and all you can say           where you live now ? I was thinking of trying to get in touch with you . " She looked even plumper than she had in the mystic \'s low-grade crystal ball . Wearing a loose flowered dress , she was sitting on the edge of a large spool bed . " You would n\'t happen to have anything like a fig newton or a granola bar with you , I suppose ? " " No , nope . " " Oliver - that \'s Oliver Sanson , my present husband - has been keeping me on a terribly skimpy diet , " she explained . " How , by the way , did you know I was locked up here in my bedroom ? " He moved nearer the bed . " Little Eva . " " That \'s your wife , is it ? " " No , she \'s one of Batsford \'s contacts in the spirit world and she - " " Oh , you \'re not messing with mediums and sorcerers , are you ? " She shook her head . " That \'s a           with that sort of - " " Too bad you did n\'t feel that way in your wild youth , jenny - when you made your damned deal with Shug Nrgyzb . " " That \'s pronounced Nrgyzb , " she corrected . " And , listen , Peter , I really do feel awfully bad about that . In fact , that \'s why I \'m a sort of prisoner in my own home right now . " She glanced down at his wet trousers and noticed that the knee was torn out of one leg . " I bet Rollo took a nip at you . Or was it Bosko ? " " The bigger of the two police dogs-he did n\'t introduce himself . " He rubbed at his knee . " Batsford had both those beasts hypnotized and then Little Eva took over to tell us your husband was out and that you were locked up here . " " Yes , tonight \'s Oliver \'s poker night . " Dropping into a fat pink armchair facing the big bed , he said , " Get           a demon from the netherworld inspired your husband to stow you away . " " You do n\'t have anything of a sweet nature with you ? Something with a peanut butter center would be especially welcome about - " " In a little over three weeks , Jenny , Shug Nrgyzb is going to pop up amidst , as it \'s been explained to me , considerable fire and brimstone and snarf me down . So let \'s forget about other sorts of eating experiences for now . " " I \'m truly sorry about this , " the plump gray-haired woman assured him . " At the time I only thought how nice it would be if you had a rich , happy life . " " Rich , happy and short . " " Thirty years , my gosh , it seemed like a heck of a long time back then , Peter , " she said . " And you have had a pretty happy and successful life , have n\'t you ? I was disappointed that I \'ve never seen anything about you in Time           told myself yours was probably a quieter sort of success , out of the limelight . " " We \'ll go into that later , " he said , impatient . " Tell me how your husband fits into my problem . " " Well , I could n\'t exactly remember when your birthday was , " she said . " We lost touch an awfully long time ago . But , I do n\'t know , I started to get the feeling that it was getting close and that thirty years had gone by . I had n\'t told you what I \'d done then because I thought we \'d be together forever and ever and I wanted it to be a surprise . " She sighed , looking up at the pink ceiling . " It occurred to me the other day that I should find out where you were and give you a ring . " " \' Hello , Pete , a big green monster \'s going to gobble you up on your birthday . Bye . " " " Anyway , Peter , I decided           Does n\'t the guy know about your dabbling in black magic ? " " Oh , as I told you , I gave all that up years and years ago . Right after I quit smoking pot and a couple husbands before this one . " She shook her head . " Oliver is a very successful contractor here in Northern California . Well , he \'s about $900,000 in the hole right now , but that \'s not too bad . He \'s going to hid on building the new Marin County ArtPlex . That \'s that mall sort of thing where they \'ll have an opera house and a ballet stage and a theater-in-the-round and all sons of gourmet restaurants and exotic souvenir shops and - " " Why \'d he lock you up ? " " Because I would n\'t go along with what he wanted , " she replied . " He was n\'t at all interested in your impending doom , Peter , but he was most anxious that I summon up this demon for him . " " He wanted to make a deal           to build this thing ? " She nodded , sniffling some . " That \'s it exactly , yes , " she said . " He hopes to get inside information on the bids and try to guarantee that he \'ll be the one chosen to build the ArtPlex . " " You refused . " She shuddered , hugging herself . " I told him it was much too dangerous , " she said . " I simply do n\'t want to mess with black magic ever again . " He left the chair and stood over her . " But you could summon up this demon ? " " I suppose , " she said slowly , not looking at him . " I \'d have to dig up my old magic books and - " " Where are the books , Jenny ? " " That \'s exactly what Oliver wants to know . " Sighing , she shuddered again . " He says he \'s going to keep me locked away until I give in , go get the books and arrange an interview with the           ? " " Course not . I \'m pretty certain they \'re stored up in Aunty Bunny \'s attic someplace . " He frowned , thoughtful . " I remember her . That \'s the one who lives over in the Berkeley hills , is n\'t it , in that tumble-down Victorian place ? " " Poor Aunty Bunny \'s been dead nearly five years and the house \'s been locked up for the past two or three . " " You can get in ? " " I have a key , sure , " she admitted . " But , really , I think it \'s too risky to try summoning up Shug Nrgyzb . " " Maybe , but we have to talk to him , " he told her evenly . " You \'re going to convince him that I \'m a dupe in this whole mess . And we \'ll persuade him to cancel the deal . " " He \'s not a very amiable demon . " " So I \'ve been told . But we have to try to get him to be           plump arms and lifted her to her feet : " C\'m on , jenny , you owe me this . " After a moment she said , " Okay , all right . I \'ll make a try at it . " BATSFORD SNEEZED . " The dust lies thick upon these ancient tomes , " he remarked and sneezed again . The three of them were up in the dim-lit attic of the three-story Victorian house high in the hills of Berkeley . Thunder was rumbling outside and a chill night wind was rattling the shutters and trim that the old place was thick with . Jennifer , squatting beside an open steamer trunk , was leafing through a thick volume bound in yellowish leather . With her other hand she was eating fig newtons from the big box they \'d stopped to buy at a 24-hour supermarket en route . " Could you , Jenny , maybe refrain from snacking and concentrate on this spell ? " mentioned Pete . " Relax , I \'ve just now found it . " After wiping crumbs off her chin ,           volume . Batsford tilted his head so he could read the title on the spine . " The Compleat Evil Spells of the Infamous Count Monstrodamus . " He nodded , frowning . " A notorious sorcerer in his day . " " And he wrote up some terrific spells . " Jennifer placed the open book on the dusty attic floor . " We might as well do the whole business right here . No use messing up any of the rooms . " " How mess up ? " asked Pete . " When a fiery demon shows up , there \'s often smoke damage , " she said . " Right now , I need some magic chalk . " " Here you go , dear lady . " From a rumpled pocket in his rumpled jacket , Batsford produced a stub of bright yellow chalk and presented it to Jennifer . " Thanks . Now , you guys , push enough boxes aside so that I can have a clear space about six feet across . " Pete was leaning against a stack of large cardboard           of the way . Lightning crackled outside and the single window in the slantceilinged attic glowed an electric blue for a few seconds . Jennifer ate another fig newton . When sufficient space was available , she drew , on her hands and knees , a large pentagram on the raw wood flooring . " Little lopsided , " observed Batsford , who was sitting in an old bentwood rocker against a wall . " It \'ll do . " Jennifer stood up , panting some . She bent and gathered up the book of Count Monstrodamus \'s spells . " Maybe you better hunker down behind something at first , Peter . If he sees you right off - well , he may just devour you and the heck with waiting until your birthday . " " That would be violating the halfwit agreement . " " Even so . " Pete moved behind a stack of old suitcases , a spot from which he could n\'t even see the pentagram . He could hear Jennifer commence to read aloud from the magic book . It sounded as though           interspersed with phrases in French . She droned on for about three minutes and then sneezed several times . Next came an echoing thump . He risked a look . Jennifer was squatting on the floor , picking up the fallen magic book . " Was that part of the ritual - the sneezing ? " he inquired . " No , it \'s all the damn dust up here . Now go hide again . " He complied . " Rats , " muttered Jennifer . " I lost my place . Jeez , I guess I better start over again . " Pete emerged again . " Wo n\'t that screw things up ? " " Hush , quit heckling . " " Ca n\'t you just pick up where you left off ? That would probably be less risky and involve less chance of - " " Possibly , but I do n\'t remember where I left off . It \'s safer , when summoning up fiends from the nether regions , to get in every word of the spell . " " Okay , you \'re           once more . " I have n\'t done any of this stuff for years , remember ? Quit interrupt ing and I \'ll give it another try , " she suggested . " You were n\'t such a fussbudget when we were romantically involved . " " I was n\'t on any demon \'s menu back then . " " Kids , quit this squabbling , " put in Batsford . " Let \'s get on with the ritual . " Pete sighed , shrugged , and hunched down further . When jennifer sneezed again , Pete did n\'t peek again or say anything . She got through the entire spell on the second try , stumbling on just one phrase - which might \'ve been in Ancient Persian - and only sneezing twice . Gradually all outside sounds started to fade and an immense silence filled the attic . Then Pete became aware of an odd humming noise . It sounded like dozens of people having a violent argument , only very far away . The room was growing increasingly hot , too . " Well , rash mortal           sort of voice a cement mixer would have if it developed the ability to speak . And it seemed to be coming from several places at once . Very slowly , and carefully , Pete started inching his head toward the edge of the barrier of suitcases . Thick yellow smoke was billowing all around . " I have summoned you , " began Jennifer in a pale , nervous voice , " I have summoned you , O Mighty Shug Nrgyzh , so that I might humbly - " " I \'m usually addressed , " the demon informed her , " as O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb . And you \'re mispronouncing Nrgyzb . " " I \'m frightfully sorry and I offer an abject apology , O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , " she said , voice shaky . " I do n\'t know if you remember me , but - " " You are Jennifer Windmiller . I never forget someone with whom I have made a binding and unbreakable contract . " Pete risked a look from behind the suitcases .           what passed for his head , was up near the beamed attic ceiling . He was a muddy shade of green and had lumps and knobs and scales and something that looked like mildew all over his huge body . Although it did n\'t seem likely you could pick up mildew in a place that was as hot as the netherworld was rumored to be . Yellow smoke was fuming out of his mouth and nose and what might be his ears . " It \'s about that very contract , " said Jennifer , " that I want to have a chat . " She shut the book but kept her plump finger in it as a bookmark . " You see , O Mighty and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , I - " " You left out Exalted . Things like that really annoy me , " rumbled the green demon . " Right . Well , the point is it was I who made the deal with you and not the person who reaped the benefits . So it is n\'t exactly fair to make him now pay           You were merely the novice sorcerer who did the negotiating , " said the demon . " Why do n\'t you come out and join us , Peter ? " Pete swallowed twice before stepping out from behind the stack of suitcases . " Hi , " he said as he came into the open . " I sure hope we can work this out . " " We have a saying in the netherworld , " Shug Nrgyzb told him . " A deal is a deal . " " Just a moment , " put in Batsford . The demon did n\'t bother to look back at the rocking chair that the mystic was sitting in . " Do n\'t intrude , " he advised . Pete said , " What we \'re trying to get across to you , sir , is that I never personally had anything to do with - " " What did I tell you people to call me ? " " O Mighty Exalted and Incomparable Shug Nrgyzb , " said Pete . " Okay , let \'s get back to my           flapping demon to save your own husband from going down the toilet . No , but for this simp you whip up a big fat ugly green one . " A large tan man in a conservative gray business suit had come running up the stairs to the attic and he charged through the doorway now . " Oliver , how \'d you know I was at Aunty Bunny \'s ? " " As fate would have it , Jen , I was driving home from my card gamewhere I lost a flapping $1200 - just as you and these two schmucks were racing away , " said Oliver Sanson . " Assuming you were up to no good , I followed . " " Cease , " boomed the demon , producing an extra volume of smoke . " Who is this vile intruder ? " " Vile intruder my ass . " Oliver faced him , hands on hips . " I \'ll get to you in a minute . First , though , I want to get something straight with my devoted wife here . Honey ,           demon , " speaks disrespectfully to Shug Nrgyzb . " " Hey , hold on a minute , " said Sanson . He took a few more steps toward his wife . " Is this the guy who can ... what \'s wrong , Jen ? " She was shaking her head vigorously and pointing at the demon . Sanson started to turn around just as a large green paw scooped him up . Peter sprinted to Jennifer \'s side and took hold of her head . " Time to leave . " " But he \'s going to devour Oliver . " " You ca n\'t stop him . " " True , " she acknowledged . As they started down the wooden stairs to the landing , Pete heard a large chomping sound and then a scream . Then a piping little voice said , " Hey , you big bozo , what do you think you \'re doing ? " Pete and Jennifer kept running . Returning to the red plastic seat next to Pete , Batsford said , " You really can not , my boy           . " Pete was sitting with his hands resting on his knees , staring out at the gray day beyond the waiting room windows . A massive airliner went roaring up into the afternoon . " You \'re sure everything is going to work out ? " " Thanks to Little Eva , " said the mystic . " She really has a knack for negotiating with demons . " " She should n\'t have talked him out of devouring Jennifer \'s husband . Sanson deserved to be gobbled up , the bastard . " " Think of the problems the dear lady would \'ve had trying to explain what had happened to him if Shug Nrgyzb had eaten up the simp in his entirety . " " I suppose . " " And her hubby \'s experiences with that fire-breathing critter drove all thoughts of making any sort of deal with a demon from his pea brain for good and all . " Pete watched another plane go climbing up into the sky . " But listen , if Little Eva \'s so terrific at networking with demons ,           deal ? " Batsford took a sip from his paper cup . " I think we made a pretty good deal , all things considered , " he said . " Instead of devouring you in the early hours of your birthday this year , he graciously extended your contract for another thirty years . " " That \'s going to be great when he shows up at the old folks home to collect . " " Look on the bright side , " advised Batsford after another sip . " You also get thirty more years of fabulous success . " Pete sighed . " Yeah , I \'m really looking forward to that , " he said . \n This new movie airs on PBS on April 16 &; 17 Photograph Mr. Micawber and young David hide from Micawber \'s creditors .', 'Clara : Davy !

"', '" So \'s Styrofoam , " Ginny shot back .', "All this time Bonnie was staring at the soggy toes of her shoes , wondering : her mugs at home -- were n't a couple of them from Conran 's , too ? Was she poisoning the kids ? Wait , but the kids did n't drink coffee . Thank God , she thought : she was only poisoning herself .", "Several people rushed to second it . Bonnie , sipping surreptitiously from her contraband cup , would have , too , but did not dare open her mouth . Already she had acquired a reputation as something of a loose cannon : fickle in her loyalties , wanting in seriousness , slow to volunteer . Doubtless it was all true . She simply did not feel like a good citizen these days . She lacked the time , the energy , the patience ; ultimately , she lacked the will . It was a shameful thing to admit at this point in global culture , but she 'd about had it with participatory democracy -- she 'd have been happier just writing out a check every month and letting paid professionals make all the decisions ; or , better , to give herself over to a benevolent fascist dictator for a while , to have at least a few of the           , she thought . At times the name rose inside her reflexively , like bile .", "But that was n't altogether fair . Strictly speaking , Kevin had been no more to blame in the matter than Bonnie herself , who had after all done no one any good by sleeping with an old boyfriend , Stanley Gottlieb , at the M.L.A. in San Francisco , for reasons that remained shrouded in fog even now . She 'd been five months pregnant with Petey at the time ; she remembered thinking , rather magically in retrospect , that the extra layers of flesh would somehow insulate her from consequence . But they had n't , of course . And now here she was . Stanley still made an occasional appearance ,           , almost incidentally , to screw up her life ; but Kevin , that dear , sweet , narcissistic mess , was gone -- decamped to Ecuador , where he was finishing his post-doc and working with a psychoanalyst to overcome his innumerable blocks . He must have been making some progress down there , too , because of late his child support checks had begun to arrive roughly the same month they were due .", '" ... and now , " Geoff was saying , " if you \'ll turn to page three , you \'ll see the charts drawn up by the personnel committee , detailing the various benefit packages available to the staff ...

" asked Lucia Todd-Frazen , interrupting a discussion of the dental plan .', '" I just want you all to know that Harvey and I -- and I think I speak for both of us even though he \'s not here tonight ? Because we really love you guys on staff , the work you do , you \'re like part of our family , your patience , your involvement , your ... and we believe in labor , we do . We support it . Even though we \'re not technically working class ourselves , of course , and sometimes , like with the Teamsters , or the restaurant workers downtown , a couple years ago , those indictments ? ... But what I want to say is that this measure , we support it , both of us do ... completely', '" Workpersons , \' " grumbled Thea Doyle .', 'Then Lucia cleared her throat again , and everyone froze .', 'Jesus Christ , thought Bonnie . Gim me a break .', "Under normal circumstances , the sight of Lucia Todd-Frazen getting emotional at a meeting was no more surprising or upsetting a phenomenon than the buzzing of the sodium lights in the parking lot outside . But tonight it seemed to Bonnie that the evening 's very skin had been punctured . Horrified , she tried to remember : Had she said the words aloud ? She 'd done everything else wrong that day , why not this , too ? Oh God , her nature , her true nature , had finally revealed itself : She 'd said something bitchy and awful , severed the cord that bound civilized , cooperative people together , and now they 'd all hate her . And meanwhile it would be Petey ,           not even count past three , whose skinny nose , a small parody of her own , could not be persuaded to stop running -- it would be Petey who 'd suffer the consequences .", "Only when she was alone in the bright tiled shelter of the bathroom did the anxiety subside a bit . Standing at the sink , she splashed cold water on her face , sensing that some personal crisis -- she could not have           she was left feeling somewhat depleted . Lucia 's speech , in the momentary stillness , continued to galumph indignantly through her head . I have a real issue with this . When had issues become possessions , Bonnie wondered , and why did n't she own more of them herself ? But then she did , did n't she ? She owned plenty . What would it matter , if she added to the pile one more ?", 'Back out in the hallway , she lost a moment or two to indecision , trying to establish whether it was better to return to the gym or maybe just leave . Either way she would be late getting home . So she stopped at the phone in the hallway to call Cress .', '" Hey , Bon ? " Larry Albeit was approaching her with a concerned look . " You okay ? "', '          "', 'Bonnie shook her head . Talk ? Things ? Things were the problem . Talk was the problem . Men were the problem . Nothing that Larry Albeit was offering could possibly be of any constructive benefit . " We should probably get back , " she said . " The meeting . "', '" Really ? " Despite herself , Bonnie giggled . The sound it made in the hallway was so loud , so awful and garish , that it might have issued from the wall of paper jungle animals behind her .', "Bonnie hesitated .           to be marked by this same sign : Where Do You Want to Be Least ? But it so happened that she had never seen such a thing as a joint with her name on it before , and it was partly in hopes of making up for a lifetime of such deprivations , or so she told herself , that she followed Larry Albeit out to the parking lot . There his Volvo lay gleaming under the streetlight 's yellow halo , enormous and sleek , a vehicle for all the soul 's burdensome dreams . Larry got in behind the wheel , and Bonnie , quickly , so as not to change her mind , climbed in on the passenger 's side . The position gave her an odd sensation of backwardness , of the self inverted by mirrors -- she was accustomed to being the driver , not the driven -- but in the end she decided that it was no stranger , in fact , than anything else .", '" Never mind she said . " It does n\'t matter . "', '" Not to me . I \'m happy just to be out of there .

Do you think something \'s terribly wrong with me ? "', '" Well , I do n\'t care if there is . I mean , good lord , she was crying over dental benefits in there . "', '" Well , so do I. And one of them is she \'s wacko . "', '" Yeah , yeah . I know . "', '" Sure . "', '" What is it with you lawyers ? " Bonnie asked , watching him resume his search for the wayward joint .

It must have been that , or the late hour , or the unlikely surroundings , or else merely the promiscuous way that such things as germs and laughter travel between people -- in any event , Bonnie began to laugh a little herself . At least she assumed it was laughter . It had been a while . Was laughter supposed to make her stomach so bitter , her cheeks           Larry was leaning forward again , his eyes small reddish stones on the placid pond of his forehead . " You okay ?

Just what are you proposing ? " Her stomach flopped over like a salmon .

She could feel it taking off on a bobsled run of its own , circling giddily for a while and then slowing , easing itself towards the smooth , solid topography of Larry 's shoulder -- the surface to which all earthly gravity would consign her . All right , okay : she let it go . And , yes , the sensation was luxurious , damn it , rather like dropping into a wide , silken net . And she deserved it , too . She deserved it for all her hard work , for every paper she had written or graded , every diaper , every omelette , every load of laundry , every aimless night she had passed staring at the crack in the wall above the toaster , wondering how not to fall in . Yes , she had worked hard , very goddamned hard , and now she was due ... well , something , she was certainly due something ...", '" Are you sure ? All those people , they \'ll be -- "', "But once she had extricated herself from the car , the wind caught her , whipping around like a shroud , as if to expose -- or perhaps , she wondered briefly , enfold ? -- her . Overhead , through the skeletal branches , she could see the cold dear eye of the moon . It was getting late . Parents were beginning to push through the double doors and head for their cars . She could not make out their faces in the darkness , but she recognized them by their good bulky winter coats : Geoff Dahlberg , Lucia Todd-Frazen , Howard Peeler . Alice Orkin and Thea Doyle were hugging goodbye ; Bethany Freitag was leaning into Ginny Stern 's car , hammering out some detail of car pooling ; Arthur Browning was talking into his cellular phone , informing his wife to stick           way . The meeting was over .", 'But she had always liked that coat , and it had another year or two left in it , and she could not afford another right now . So she turned and headed back to the double doors .', 'Bonnie made a theatrical flailing gesture with the palms of her hands . " My coat . "', '" Oh . Oh           for you , though . "', '" Let \'s try the lost and found box , " Sara suggested .', '" Hey , " Sara said . " Is that it ? "', 'When she unfolded the coat , a slip of paper fluttered off and fell to the floor . Bonnie paused ; she was aware of being a little bit stoned at the moment , and also of Sara Montague , keys in hand , holding the door that led to the foyer , watching . Hurriedly , she bent over to retrieve the slip of paper , dirtying the knees of her jeans in the process .', "Suddenly a gate rose in Bonnie 's heart , and all its channels flooded at once . She was here , she was known , she was being looked after . Things would be delivered to her .", 'When she got home , she found Cress at the kitchen table , thoughtfully smoking a cigarette . " How were they ? " Bonnie asked .', '" Sorry . I tried to call . "', '" Yeah . " She glanced half-heartedly at the dishes piled in the sink . Was any pizza left ? She was famished .', '" Let me just sit for a minute , okay ? Then I \'ll call you a cab . "', "So they sat there a while . Cress put down her bag and lit another cigarette , pausing every so often to tap the ashes into a teacup , and whatever obsessions were running through her head , she chose to retain there . Bonnie , too tired to shrug out of her coat , allowed her eyes to fall closed . She was not thinking about the long evening she had just passed , or the dishes still to be done , the lunches still to be made . She was thinking only of this moment right now , this space that did not demand to be filled because           , suspended in time 's web , between past and future , in a state of pure potentiality . And it occurred to Bonnie that in the final analysis she was a very capable person , capable of more , oh , much more than she could possibly envision , perhaps even capable of being happy ...", 'And Bonnie , her eyes still closed , purse clutched to her stomach , thought clearly and without bitterness , This is going to cost me , too .', '" He liked you , " said the girl , turning to the woman who was still clapping .

She let if fall onto the small constellation that she was arranging on the hem of her ballet skirt and pensively kept rubbing a drop of dried glue that had fallen on her knee .

You said he was going to die , that he was at the end of the line ... And the next day he was just radiant , asking for milk first thing .

Motionless as if they 'd been turned to stone in their flight , the two women stood looking at the living room clock . The black woman was the first to move . She whispered :", '" You go , Lu', "Outside the long blast of a horn was fading away           maid softly pulled away from the girl 's hand . She went down the stairs on tip-toe and opened the door to the street .", 'And , using the handrail as support , glued to it , she quickly went down the steps . When she slammed the door behind her , a few green sequins rolled down the steps in the same direction , as if trying to catch her .', '\n " If you do n\'t sit your stinkin \' , useI less butt back down in that shopping cart , I swear I \'ll bust your greasy face in T \' she screamed at the 3-yearold child in front of her . He studied her face , decided she was serious , and put his leg back inside the cart . He was standing near the front end of the cart , amidst an assorted pile of cigarette boxes , egg cartons , and pop bottles . He did n\'t want to sit down anyway because of the soft , uncomfortable load in his pants that had been there all afternoon and it felt cold and squishy when he moved too much . He rarely had accidents like that , but when he did , Mama sometimes made him keep it in his pants all day to " teach him a lesson . " Jerome was only three , but he had already learned many such lessons . He \'d never seen Sesame Street , never heard of Fountain Square-he did n\'t even know that he lived in Cincinnati . But he knew the important thingslike never mess with           you woke her up , especially if she had somebody in the bed with her . And never touch the hot thing that Mama used to light her cigarettes , even if the mysterious orange and blue fire that comes out of it liked to tease you and dance for only a moment before running away . Because Mama once had caught Jerome playing with the lighter , and she made the fire come out and she held his hand right over the flame , but it was n\'t his friendly fire dancer , but a cruel red soldier that made his hand scream and made him dizzy with pain and he could smell something like the meat Mama cooked , but it was his hand . When she stopped she had washed his hand with cool water and soothed him with warm hugs and wrapped the place where the fire soldier had stabbed him with salve and bandages . She told him that she had done it " for his own good " and to " teach him a lesson . " He had tried to ## tell her           , but she was n\'t listening , and he had given up , thankful for the hugs and the silence . One other lesson that Jerome had learned was never , never stay near Mama when she sniffed the white stuff . She got it from a man named Leroy who smelled too sweet and smiled too much . When he leaves , you hide behind the couch and hope Aunt Bessie comes over because sometimes Mama yells and gets her belt or her shoe and hits , and hits , and hits .... And sometimes she just goes to sleep on the floor and it gets dark and you cry and your tummy feels tight and hurty , but at least there \'s no shoe to run away from . Once Aunt Bessie had found Jerome curled up behind the couch sucking his thumb . His pajamas were soaked and smelly and he had been shivering and hungry . Mama had been gone all day . She had told him not to leave the room , and he had been really , really good , but he was so           him to her apartment and given him a warm bath , some hot soup and some of Ronnie \'s sleepers , even though she had to pin the back of them so they would n\'t fall off . Then Mama had come and she and Aunt Bessie had yelled and screamed so much that Jerome had to hold his ears while he lay curled on the foot of Aunt Bessie \'s bed . Finally Mama started crying and Aunt Bessie was saying stuff like , " I know , honey , " and Jerome knew he was going back home . Mama had hugged him and kissed him and held him close to her until he fell asleep that night . Jerome had felt so warm and special and golden-he wanted to feel like that forever . He knew his Mama loved him . She had bought him a GI Joe man last week and it was n\'t even his birthday or Christmas or anything , and most days she combed his hair and dressed him in clean clothes and told him to say , " Yes , Ma\'am "           days , she would hug him and smile and say , " You know you \'re my best baby boy , do n\'t you Jeromey ? You know you \'re my baby , do n\'t you ? " And he would smile and that warm , golden feeling would start at his toes and fill him all the way up to his smile . Even though Mama had yelled at him , today was a good day . Mama always yelled-it was no big deal . ( Some days he yelled back at her . Then she would slap him and he \'d cry and he \'d cuss at her and then she would slap him until his head hurt . So mostly he ignored her . ) But today was a good day , a shiny day , he thought . The sun was bright gold outside against a clear blue sky . And inside the grocery store there were so many colors and sounds and lights that Jerome just grinned . Mama called it the big store and it was always crowded when they went . Other children           pass very close to each other . Jerome liked to pretend he was driving a big , fine silver car down the expressway . Sometimes the cart would be a tank , as he passed cautiously through rows of armed cling peaches and silent sentinels that looked like boxes of Frosted Flakes . And at the checkout lane , the armies rolled smoothly down the long black road that disappeared under the counter . He ? started to ask Mama where it went , but it was more fun to imagine that it went to a secret hideout where only sweet potatoes and boxes of oatmeal were allowed . When they got home from the grocery store , Jerome sat on the floor and watched Mama stack the boxes and cans on the shelf . She was whistlinghe had never heard her whistle before and he loved the way she laughed as he tried to imitate her . She changed his clothes ( and did n\'t even yell at him for not being a big boy ) and gave him two cookies and an apple . Then she went ONE           came out , she had changed clothes and Jerome thought he had never seen anything so lovely . She had on her sparkly fancy dress that Jerome liked to touch . " Mama will be right back , baby , " she told him . " I just have to go see Mr. Leroy for a minute . You stay right here and wait for me , you hear ? " Jerome started to cry , but he did n\'t want Mama to lose her good mood , so he just nodded and bit his lip . The door closed and he could hear her high heels clicking on the steps . Then it was very , very quiet . After he finished both his cookies and the apple had turned brown on the white parts , Jerome looked for something to do . It was getting dark and he wanted GI Joe to sit with him because the shadows on the wall were getting long and scary . He found GI Joe on the floor next to Mama \'s bed , right next to her cigarette lighter that she           up and for a time he used it as a gun for Joe , then it was a log for Joe to jump over , then it was an enemy for Joe to attack . Finally Jerome started idly flicking the little red handle . At first it just made a scratchy sound and the smell made him cough and remember how he got that hard brown place in the palm of his hand . Then he remembered the tiny fire dancer , and he wondered if it still lived in there with firesword soldier . After numerous flicks , he got the fire to stay on . He grinned with delight . The dancer was there , smiling at him and bowing for him , changing from splendid orange to icy green to iridescent purple . The lighter flame flickered magically , making golden the purple shadows on the wall . With sudden inspiration , Jerome shouted , " Hey Joe , we got a torch ! " as he and GI Joe marched around the kitchen table . Jerome crawled under the table then , flicking the lighter           Joe . They fought shadows and monsters ; they blew up cities and kingdoms . Jerome made the sound effects and GI Joe dutifully followed his general into combat . As the mighty battle came to its climax , Jerome crawled up on a chair and stood on the kitchen table , waving his arms triumphantly . Mama would kill me , he thought momentarily , if she saw me up here , but the thought passed as GI Joe fought the terrible mountain man by the light of only a single torch . Suddenly the tiny light of GI Joe \'s torch was huge and bright as the tip of the one curtain in the window touched the flame . Jerome heard a loud " whoosh " and then he turned in terror to see the whole window covered with harsh red flames which crawled and licked and jumped along the windowsill . Jerome scrambled down from the table and ran to his hiding place behind the couch . " Mama said stay here and wait for her , " he told himself . " I know she \'ll           the corner of the sofa and watched the flames consume the boxes of cereal and macaroni that Mama had just bought . When it reached the bottle of Big K soda , Jerome watched , fascinated , as the soda bubbled , then fizzed . When it finally exploded with a loud sizzling pop , Jerome jumped back behind the sofa , coughing and wheezing from the heat and smoke . He curled up in his usual position then , thumb in his mouth , crying softly . He thought about his Mama and how pretty she was . He wondered if GI Joe would ever find his way back . And he wondered how he could see so many colors with his eyes closed . \n Hunters in the snow Wolff , Tobias Triquarterly ; Spring 1990 ; 78 ; Research Library ## Hunters in the Snow Tobias Wolff Tub had been waiting for an hour in the falling snow . He paced the sidewalk to keep warm and stuck his head out over the curb whenever he saw lights approaching . One driver stopped for him , but before Tub could wave the man on he saw the rifle on Tub \'s back and hit the gas . The tires spun on the ice . The fall of snow thickened . Tub stood below the overhang of a building . Across the road the clouds whitened just above the rooftops , and the streetlights went out . He shifted the rifle strap to his other shoulder . The whiteness seeped up the sky . A truck slid around the corner , horn blaring , rear end sashaying . Tub moved to the sidewalk and held up his hand . The truck jumped the curb and kept coming , half on the street and half on the sidewalk . It was n\'t slowing down at all . Tub stood for a moment , still holding           slipped off his shoulder and clattered on the ice ; a sandwich fell out of his pocket . He ran for the steps of the building . Another sandwich and a package of cookies tumbled onto the new snow . He made the steps and looked back . The truck had stopped several feet beyond where Tub had been standing . He picked up his sandwiches and his cookies and slung the rifle and went to the driver \'s window . The driver was bent against the steering wheel , slapping his knees and drumming his feet on the floorboards . He looked like a cartoon of a person laughing , except that his eyes watched the man on the seat beside him . " You ought to see yourself , " said the driver . " He looks just like a beach ball with a hat on , does n\'t he ? Does n\'t he , Frank ? " The man beside him smiled and looked off . " You almost ran me down , " said Tub . " You could \'ve killed me. " ## " Come           driver . " Be mellow , Kenny was just messing around . " He opened the door and slid over to the middle of the seat . Tub took the bolt out of his rifle and climbed in beside him . " I waited an hour , " he said . " If you meant ten o\'clock , why did n\'t you say ten o\'clock ? " " Tub , you have n\'t done anything but complain since we got here , " said the man in the middle . " If you want to piss and moan all day you might as well go home and bitch at your kids . Take your pick . " When Tub did n\'t say anything , he turned to the driver . " O.K. , Kenny , let \'s hit the road . " Some juvenile delinquents had heaved a brick through the windshield on the driver \'s side , so the cold and snow tunneled right into the cab . The heater did n\'t work . They covered themselves with a couple of blankets Kenny had brought along and pulled down           his hands warm by rubbing them under the blanket , but Frank made him stop . They left Spokane and drove deep into the country , running along black lines of fences . The snow let up , but still there was no edge to the land where it met the sky . Nothing moved in the chalky fields . The cold bleached their faces and made the stubble stand out on their cheeks and along their upper lips . They had to stop and have coffee several times before they got to the woods where Kenny wanted to hunt . Tub was for trying some place different ; two years in a row they \'d been up and down this land and had n\'t seen a thing . Frank did n\'t care one way or the other ; he just wanted to get out of the goddamned truck . " Feel that , " Frank said . He spread his feet and closed his eyes and leaned his head way back and breathed deeply . " Tune in on that energy . " " Another thing , " said           the land around here is posted . " Frank breathed out . " Stop bitching , Tub . Get centered . " " I was n\'t bitching . " " Centered , " said Kenny . " Next thing you \'ll be wearing a nightgown , Frank . Selling flowers out at the airport . " " Kenny , " said Frank . " You talk too much . " " O.K. , " said Kenny . " I wo n\'t say a word . Like I wo n\'t say anything about a certain baby-sitter . " " What baby-sitter ? " asked Tub . " That \'s between us , " said Frank , looking at Kenny . " That \'s confidential . You keep your mouth shut . " Kenny laughed . ## " You \'re asking for it , " said Frank . " Asking for what ? " " You \'ll see . " " Hey , " said Tub . " Are we hunting or what ? " Frank just smiled . They started off across the field . Tub had trouble getting through the           they could have lifted up on the top wire and stepped on the bottom wire , but they did n\'t . They stood and watched him . There were a lot of fences and Tub was puffing when they reached the woods . They hunted for over two hours and saw no deer , no tracks , no sign . Finally they stopped by the creek to eat . Kenny had several slices of pizza and a couple of candy bars ; Frank had a sandwich , an apple , two carrots , and a square of chocolate ; Tub put out one hard-boiled egg and a stick of celery . " You ask me how I want to die today , " said Kenny . " I \'ll tell you , burn me at the stake . " He turned to Tub . " You still on that diet ? " He winked at Frank . " What do you think ? You think I like hard-boiled eggs ? " " All I can say is , it \'s the first diet I ever heard of where you gained           weight ? " " Oh , pardon me . I take it back . You \'re just wasting away before my very eyes . Is n\'t he , Frank ? " Frank had his fingers fanned out , tips against the bark of the stump where he \'d laid his food . His knuckles were hairy . He wore a heavy wedding band , and on his right pinky was another gold ring with a flat face and " F " printed out in what looked like diamonds . He turned it this way and that . " Tub , " he said , " you have n\'t seen your own balls in ten years . " Kenny doubled over laughing . He took off his hat and slapped his leg with it . " What am I supposed to do ? " said Tub . " It \'s my glands . " They left the woods and hunted along the creek . Frank and Kenny worked one bank and Tub worked the other , moving upstream . The snow was light , but the drifts were deep and hard           was smooth , undisturbed , and after a time he lost interest . He stopped looking for tracks and just tried to keep up with Frank and Kenny on the other side . A moment came when he realized he had n\'t seen them in a long time . The breeze was moving from ## 11 him to them ; when it stilled he could sometimes hear them arguing but that was all . He quickened his pace , breasting hard into the drifts , fighting the snow away with his knees and elbows . He heard his heart and felt the flush on his face , but he never once stopped . Tub caught up with Frank and Kenny at a bend in the creek . They were standing on a log that stretched from their bank to his . Ice had backed up behind the log . Frozen reeds stuck out , barely nodding when the air moved . " See anything ? " asked Frank . Tub shook his head . There was n\'t much daylight left , and they decided to head back toward the road           , using the trail Tub had broken . Before they had gone very far , Kenny stopped . " Look at that , " he said , and pointed to some tracks going from the creek back into the woods . Tub \'s footprints crossed right over them . There on the bank , plain as day , were several mounds of deer sign . " What do you think that is , Tub ? " Kenny kicked at it . " Walnuts on vanilla icing ? " " I guess I did n\'t notice . " Kenny looked at Frank . " I was lost . " " You were lost . Big deal . " They followed the tracks into the woods . The deer had gone over a fence half buried in drifting snow . A no-hunting sign was nailed to the top of one of the posts . Frank laughed and said the son of a bitch could read . Kenny wanted to go after him , but Frank said no way -- the people out here did n\'t mess around . He thought maybe the           if they asked , though Kenny was n\'t so sure . Anyway , he figured that by the time they walked to the truck and drove up the road and doubled back it would be almost dark . " Relax , " said Frank . " You ca n\'t hurry nature . If we \'re meant to get that deer , we \'ll get it . If we \'re not , we wo n\'t . " They started back toward the truck . This part of the woods was mainly pine . The snow was shaded and had a glaze on it . It held up Kenny and Frank , but Tub kept falling through . As he kicked forward , the edge of the crust bruised his shins . Kenny and Frank pulled ahead of him , to where he could n\'t even hear their voices any more . He sat down on a stump and wiped his face . He ate both the sandwiches and half the cookies , taking his own sweet time . It was dead quiet . ## When Tub crossed the last fence into           to run for it and just managed to grab hold of the tailgate and hoist himself into the bed . He lay there panting . Kenny looked out the rear window and grinned . Tub crawled into the lee of the cab to get out of the freezing wind . He pulled his earflaps low and pushed his chin into the collar of his coat . Someone rapped on the window , but Tub would not turn around . He and Frank waited outside while Kenny went into the farmhouse to ask permission . The house was old , and paint was curling off the sides . The smoke streamed westward off the top of the chimney , fanning away into a thin gray plume . Above the ridge of the hills another ridge of blue clouds was rising . " You \'ve got a short memory , " said Tub . " What ? " said Frank . He had been staring off . " I used to stick up for you . " " O.K. , so you used to stick up for me . What \'s eating           me back there like that . " " You \'re a grown-up , Tub . You can take care of yourself . Anyway , if you think you \'re the only person with problems , I can tell you that you \'re not . " " Is something bothering you , Frank ? " Frank kicked at a branch poking out of the snow . " Never mind , " he said . " What did Kenny mean about the baby-sitter ? " " Kenny talks too much , " said Frank . " You just mind your own business . " Kenny came out of the farmhouse and gave the thumbs up , and they began walking back toward the woods . As they passed the barn , a large black hound with a grizzled snout ran out and barked at them . Every time he barked he slid backward a bit , like a cannon going off . Kenny got down on all fours and snarled and barked back at him , and the dog slunk away into the barn , looking over his shoulder and peeing a           , " said Frank . " A real graybeard . Fifteen years , if he \'s a day . " " Too old , " said Kenny . Past the barn they cut off through the fields . The land was unfenced , and the crust was freezing up thick , and they made good time . They kept to the edge of the field until they picked up the tracks again and followed them into the woods , farther and farther back toward the hills . The trees started to blur with the shadows , and the wind rose and ## needled their faces with the crystals it swept off the glaze . Finally they lost the tracks . Kenny swore and threw down his hat . " This is the worst day of hunting I ever had , bar none . " He picked up his hat and brushed off the snow . " This will be the first season since I was fifteen that I have n\'t got any deer . " " It is n\'t the deer , " said Frank . " It \'s the           you just have to go with them . " " You go with them , " said Kenny . " I came out here to get me a deer , not listen to a bunch of hippie bullshit . And if it had n\'t been for Dimples here , I would have , too . " " That \'s enough , " said Frank . " And you . . . you \'re so busy thinking about that little jailbait of yours , you would n\'t know a deer if you saw one . " " I \'m warning you , " said Frank . Kenny laughed . " I think maybe I \'ll have me a talk with a certain jailbait \'s father , " he said . " Then you can warn him , too . " " Drop dead , " said Frank and turned away . Kenny and Tub followed him back across the fields . When they were coming up to the barn , Kenny stopped and pointed . " I hate that post , " he said . He raised his rifle and fired           post splintered along its right side , up toward the top . " There , " said Kenny . " It \'s dead . " " Knock it off , " said Frank , walking ahead . Kenny looked at Tub and smiled . " I hate that tree , " he said , and fired again . Tub hurried to catch up with Frank . He started to speak , but just then the dog ran out of the barn and barked at them . " Easy , boy , " said Frank . " I hate that dog . " Kenny was behind them . " That \'s enough , " said Frank . " You put that gun down . " Kenny fired . The bullet went in between the dog \'s eyes . He sank right down into the snow , his legs splayed out on each side , his yellow eyes open and staring . Except for the blood , he looked like a small bearskin rug . The blood ran down the dog \'s muzzle into the snow . They all looked at the           to you ? " asked Tub . " He was just barking . " Kenny turned to Tub . " I hate you . " Tub shot from the waist . Kenny jerked backward against the fence and buckled to his knees . He folded his hands across his stomach . " Look , " he said . His hands were covered with blood . In the dusk his blood was more blue than red . It seemed to belong to the shadows . It ## did n\'t seem out of place . Kenny eased himself onto his back . He sighed several times , deeply . " You shot me , " he said . " I had to , " said Tub . He knelt beside Kenny . " Oh , God , " he said . " Frank . Frank . " Frank had n\'t moved since Kenny killed the dog . " Frank ! " Tub shouted . " I was just kidding around , " said Kenny . " It was a joke . Oh ! " he said , and arched his back suddenly           dug his heels into the snow and pushed himself along on his head for several feet . Then he stopped and lay there , rocking back and forth on his heels and head like a wrestler doing warm-up exercises . Frank roused himself . " Kenny , " he said . He bent down and put his gloved hand on Kenny \'s brow . " You shot him , " he said to Tub . " He made me , " said Tub . " No , no , no , " said Kenny . Tub was weeping from the eyes and nostrils . His whole face was wet . Frank closed his eyes , then looked down at Kenny again . " Where does it hurt ? " " Everywhere , " said Kenny . " Just everywhere . " " Oh , God , " said Tub . " I mean where did it go in ? " said Frank . " Here . " Kenny pointed at the wound in his stomach . It was welling slowly with blood . " You \'re lucky , " said           It missed your appendix . If it had hit your appendix , you \'d really be in the soup . " He turned and threw up onto the snow , holding his sides as if to keep warm . " Are you all right ? " asked Tub . " There \'s some aspirin in the truck , " said Kenny . " I \'m all right , " said Frank . " We \'d better call an ambulance , " said Tub . " Jesus , " said Frank , " what are we going to say ? " " Exactly what happened , " said Tub . " He was going to shoot me but I shot him first . " " No , sir ! " said Kenny . " I was n\'t either ! " Frank patted Kenny on the arm . " Easy does it , partner . " He stood . " Let \'s go . " Tub picked up Kenny \'s rifle as they walked down toward the farmhouse . " No sense leaving this around , " he said . " Kenny           one thing , " said Frank . " You \'ve really done it this time . This definitely takes the cake . " They had to knock on the door twice before it was opened by a thin ## man with lank hair . The room behind him was filled with smoke . He squinted at them . " You get anything ? " he asked . " No , " said Frank . " I knew you would n\'t . That \'s what I told the other fellow . " " We \'ve had an accident . " The man looked past Frank and Tub into the gloom . " Shoot your friend , did you ? " Frank nodded . " I did , " said Tub . " I suppose you want to use the phone . " " If it \'s O.K. " The man in the door looked behind him , then stepped back . Frank and Tub followed him into the house . There was a woman sitting by the stove in the middle of the room . The stove was smoking badly .           asleep in her lap . Her face was white and damp ; strands of hair were pasted across her forehead . Tub warmed his hands over the stove while Frank went into the kitchen to call . The man who had let them in stood at the window , his hands in his pockets . " My partner shot your dog , " said Tub . The man nodded without turning around . " I should have done it myself . I just could n\'t . " " He loved that dog so much , " the woman said . The child squirmed and she rocked it . " You asked him to ? " said Tub . " You asked him to shoot your dog ? " " He was old and sick . Could n\'t chew his food any more . I would have done it myself but I do n\'t have a gun . " " You could n\'t have anyway , " said the woman . " Never in a million years . " The man shrugged . Frank came out of the kitchen . "           hospital is fifty miles from here and all their ambulances are out anyway . " The woman knew a shortcut , but the directions were complicated and Tub had to write them down . The man told where they could find some boards to carry Kenny on . He did n\'t have a flashlight , but he said he would leave the porch light on . It was dark outside . The clouds were low and heavy-looking and the wind blew in shrill gusts . There was a screen loose on the house , and it banged slowly and then quickly as the wind rose again . They could hear it all the way to the barn . Frank went for the boards while Tub looked ## for Kenny , who was not where they had left him . Tub found him farther up the drive , lying on his stomach . " You O.K. ? " said Tub . " It hurts . " " Frank says it missed your appendix . " " I already had my appendix out . " " All right , " said Frank           you in a nice warm bed before you can say Jack Robinson . " He put the two boards on Kenny \'s right side . " Just as long as I do n\'t have one of those male nurses , " said Kenny . " Ha ha , " said Frank . " That \'s the spirit . Get ready , set , over you go , " and he rolled Kenny onto the boards . Kenny screamed and kicked his legs in the air . When he quieted down , Frank and Tub lifted the boards and carried him down the drive . Tub had the back end , and with the snow blowing into his face he had trouble with his footing . Also he was tired and the man inside had forgotten to turn the porch light on . Just past the house Tub slipped and threw out his hands to catch himself . The boards fell and Kenny tumbled out and rolled to the bottom of the drive , yelling all the way . He came to rest against the right front wheel of the truck           " You are n\'t good for diddly . " Tub grabbed Frank by the collar and backed him hard up against the fence . Frank tried to pull his hands away , but Tub shook him and snapped his head back and forth and finally Frank gave up . " What do you know about fat ? " said Tub . " What do you know about glands ? " As he spoke , he kept shaking Frank . " What do you know about me ? " " All right , " said Frank . " No more , " said Tub . " All right . " " No more talking to me like that . No more watching . No more laughing . " " O.K. , Tub . I promise . " Tub let go of Frank and leaned his forehead against the fence . His arms hung straight at his sides . " I \'m sorry , Tub . " Frank touched him on the shoulder . " I \'ll be down at the truck . " Tub stood by the fence for a while           had rolled Kenny back onto the boards and they lifted him into the bed of the truck . Frank spread the seat blankets over him . " Warm enough ? " he asked . Kenny nodded . ## 11 " O.K. Now how does reverse work on this thing ? " " All the way to the left and up . " Kenny sat up as Frank started forward to the cab . " Frank ! " " What ? " " If it sticks , do n\'t force it . " The truck started right away . " One thing , " said Frank , " you \'ve got to hand it to the Japanese . A very ancient , very spiritual culture and they can still make a hell of a truck . " He glanced over at Tub . " Look , I \'m sorry . I did n\'t know you felt that way , honest to God , I did n\'t . You should have said something . " " I did . " " When ? Name one time . " " A couple of           paying attention . " " That \'s true , Frank , " said Tub . " You do n\'t pay attention very much . " " Tub , " said Frank , " what happened back there -- I should have been more sympathetic . I realize that . You were going through a lot . I just want you to know it was n\'t your fault . He was asking for it . " " You think so ? " " Absolutely . I would have done the same thing in your shoes , no question . " The wind was blowing into their faces . The snow was a moving white wall in front of their lights ; it swirled into the cab through the hole in the windshield and settled on them . Tub clapped his hands and shifted around to stay warm , but it did n\'t work . " I \'m going to have to stop , " said Frank . " I ca n\'t feel my fingers . " Up ahead they saw some lights off the road . It was a tavern .           . A couple of them had deer strapped across their hoods . Frank parked and they went back to Kenny . " How you doing , partner ? " said Frank . " I \'m cold . " " Well , do n\'t feel like the Lone Ranger . It \'s worse inside , take my word for it . You should get that windshield fixed . " " Look , " said Tub , " he threw the blankets off . " They were lying in a heap against the tailgate . " Now look , Kenny , " said Frank , " it \'s not use whining about being cold if you \'re not going to try and keep warm . You \'ve got to do your share . " He spread the blankets over Kenny and tucked them in at the corners . " They blew off . " " Hold on to them then . " " Why are we stopping , Frank ? " ## " Because if me and Tub do n\'t get warmed up we \'re going to freeze solid and then where           the arm . " So just hold your horses . " The bar was full of men in colored jackets , mostly orange . The waitress brought coffee . " Just what the doctor ordered , " said Frank , cradling the steaming cup in his hand . His skin was bone white . " Tub , I \'ve been thinking . What you said about me not paying attention , that \'s true . " " It \'s O.K. " " No . I really had that coming . I guess I \'ve just been a little too interested in old number one . I \'ve had a lot on my mind -- not that that \'s any excuse . " " Forget it , Frank . I sort of lost my temper back there . I guess we \'re all a little on edge . " Frank shook his head . " It is n\'t just that . " " You want to talk about it ? " " Just between us , Tub ? " " Sure , Frank . Just between us . " " Tub           . " " Oh , Frank . Oh , Frank . " Tub sat back . " What \'s the problem ? Has she been seeing someone ? " " No . I wish she was , Tub . I wish to God she was . " He reached out and laid his hand on Tub \'s arm . " Tub , have you ever been really in love ? " " Well ... " " I mean really in love . " He squeezed Tub \'s wrist . " With your whole being . " " I do n\'t know . When you put it like that . " " You have n\'t , then . Nothing against you , but you \'d know it if you had . " Frank let go of Tub \'s arm . " Nancy has n\'t been running around , Tub . I have . " " Oh , Frank . " " Running around \'s not the right word for it . It is n\'t like that . She \'s not just some bit of fluff . " " Who is she           his empty cup . " Roxanne Brewer . " " Cliff Brewer \'s kid ? The baby-sitter ? " " You ca n\'t just put people into categories like that , Tub . That \'s why the whole system is wrong . And that \'s why this country is going to hell in a rowboat . " " But she ca n\'t be more than . . . " Tub shook his head . " Fifteen . She \'ll be sixteen in May . " Frank smiled . " May fourth , three ## twenty-seven P.M. Hell , Tub , a hundred years ago she \'d have been an old maid by that age . Juliet was only thirteen . " " Juliet ? Juliet Miller ? Jesus , Frank , she does n\'t even have breasts . She does n\'t even wear a top to her bathing suit . She \'s still collecting frogs . " " Not Juliet Miller -- the real Juliet . Tub , do n\'t you see how you \'re dividing people up into categories ? He \'s an executive , she \'s a secretary           years old . Tub , this so-called baby-sitter , this so-called fifteen-year-old has more in her little finger than most of us have in our entire bodies . I can tell you this little lady is something special . " Tub nodded . " I know the kids like her . " " She \'s opened up whole worlds to me that I never knew were there . " " What does Nancy think about all of this ? " " Nothing , Tub . She does n\'t know . " " You have n\'t told her ? " " Not yet . It \'s not so easy . She \'s been damned good to me all these years . Then there \'s the kids to consider . " The brightness in Frank \'s eyes trembled and he wiped quickly at them with the back of his hand . " I guess you think I \'m a complete bastard . " " No , Frank . I do n\'t think that . " " Well , you ought to . " " Frank , when you \'ve got a friend           , no matter what . That \'s how I feel about it anyway . " " You mean that , Tub ? " " Sure I do . " Frank smiled . " You do n\'t know how good it feels to hear you say that . " Kenny had tried to get out of the truck but he had n\'t made it . He was jackknifed over the tailgate , his head hanging above the bumper . They lifted him back into the bed and covered him again . He was sweating and his teeth chattered . " It hurts , Frank . " " It would n\'t hurt so much if you just stayed put . Now we \'re going to the hospital . Got that ? Say it : I \'m going to the hospital . \' " " I \'m going to the hospital . " " Again . " " I \'m going to the hospital . " " Now just keep saying that to yourself and before you know it we \'ll be there . " After they had gone a few miles ,           real boner , " he said . ## " What \'s that ? " " I left the directions on the table back there . " " That \'s O.K .. I remember them pretty well . " The snowfall lightened and the clouds began to roll back off the fields , but it was no warmer and after a time both Frank and Tub were bitten through and shaking . Frank almost did n\'t make it around a curve , and they decided to stop at the next roadhouse . There was an automatic hand dryer in the bathroom and they took turns standing in front of it , opening their jackets and shirts and letting the jet of hot air breathe across their faces and chests . " You know , " said Tub , " what you told me back there , I appreciate it . Trusting me . " Frank opened and closed his fingers in front of the nozzle . " The way I look at it , Tub , no man is an island . You \'ve got to trust someone . " "           that about my glands , that was n\'t true . The truth is I just shovel it in . " " Well , Tub ... " " Day and night , Frank . In the shower . On the freeway . " He turned and let the air play over his back . " I \'ve even got stuff in the paper towel machine at work . " " There \'s nothing wrong with your glands at all ? " Frank had taken his boots and socks off . He held first his right , then his left foot up to the nozzle . " No . There never was . " " Does Alice know ? " The machine went off and Frank started lacing up his boots . " Nobody knows . That \'s the worst of it , Frank , not the being fat -- I never got any big kick out of being thin -- but the lying . Having to lead a double life like a spy or a hit man . This sounds strange but I feel sorry for those guys , I really           having to think about what you say and do . Always feeling like people are watching you , trying to catch you at something . Never able to just be yourself . Like when I make a big deal about only having an orange for breakfast and then scarf all the way to work . Oreos , Mars bars , Twinkies , Sugar Babies , Snickers . " Tub glanced at Frank and looked quickly away . " Pretty disgusting , is n\'t it ? " " Tub . Tub . " Frank shook his head . " Come on . " He took Tub \'s arm and led him into the restaurant half of the bar . " My friend is hungry , " he told the waitress . " Bring four orders of pancakes , plenty of butter and syrup. " ## " Frank ... " " Sit down . " When the dishes came , Frank carved out slabs of butter and just laid them on the pancakes . Then he emptied the bottle of syrup , moving it back and forth over the plates . He           one hand . " Go on , Tub . " Tub ate several mouthfuls , then started to wipe his lips . Frank took the napkin away from him . " No wiping , " he said . Tub kept at it . The syrup covered his chin ; it dripped to a point like a goatee . " Weigh in , Tub , " said Frank , pushing another fork across the table . " Get down to business . " Tub took the fork in his left hand and lowered his head and started really chowing down . " Clean your plate , " said Frank when the pancakes were gone , and Tub lifted each of the four plates and licked it clean . He sat back , trying to catch his breath . " Beautiful , " said Frank . " Are you full ? " " I \'m full , " said Tub . " I \'ve never been so full . " Kenny \'s blankets were bunched up against the tailgate again . " They must have blown off , " said Tub .           said Frank . " We might as well get some use out of them . " Kenny mumbled . Tub bent over him . " What ? Speak up . " " I \'m going to the hospital , " said Kenny . " Attaboy , " said Frank . The blankets helped . The wind still got their faces and Frank \'s hands but it was much better . The fresh snow on the road and the trees sparkled under the beam of the headlight . Squares of light from farmhouse windows fell onto the blue snow in the fields . " Frank , " said Tub after a time , " you know that farmer ? He told Kenny to kill the dog . " " You \'re kidding ! " Frank leaned forward , considering . " That Kenny . What a card . " He laughed and so did Tub . Tub smiled out the back window . Kenny lay with his arms folded over his stomach , moving his lips at the stars . Right overhead was the Big Dipper , and behind , hanging           , was the North Star , pole star , help to sailors . As the truck twisted through the gentle hills , the star went back and forth between Kenny \'s boots , staying always in his sight . " I \'m going to the hospital , " said Kenny , but he was wrong . They had taken a different turn a long way back . ## \n A Leap of Faith .', "She kissed Peg on the forehead because she did n't want her to die . Still , for being such a tattle-tale she deserved a punishment so before Dora left the room , she pulled the petals off Peg 's roses . She stared at them and not knowing what to do sat back down on her own bed and cried . Once she 'd eaten a raw egg because someone forced and she told that it was like eating a bad sneeze which had gotten laughs from her father a long time ago . Poor Peg was moaning . Stop blubbering . Crying , I 'm crying ca n't you see . Dora hated the word blubbering because she thought staff members used it to sat there was no reason to cry when there always           scattered the petals onto Peg 's bible beside the vase where just the stems still stood in water so that Peg would think they 'd fallen off by themselves and then quietly turned off the light and closed the door behind her . She smelled pancakes because it was Friday . The white ceiling in the stairwell closed around her and the idea of mother coming today . Mother coming , better than pancakes .", '" It \'s too muddy , " Dora complained . She did n\'t like Dave to lead activity . She wanted Frank because he kidded better . Dave tried to make them sing songs at the same time as they walked around the pond . Frank let her sit down when she was tired , but not stupid Dave who told stories about Jesus Christ and his bleeding feet - " for you and you and you he died " - so today she faked a stone in her shoe .           because she knew what they did to lepers . There were ducks in the pond and she watched one waddle up onto the bank . Soft feathers on her lap . Did real people know how to make a duck cuddle ? Dora \'s own mother okayed one big hug at the beginning . You \'re too old to cry and she would leave early . Pulling eggs down her throat . Today , Mother my friend .', "Baby pine trees had just been planted along one bank and other segments around the pond were roped off so you would n't accidentally walk over seeds trying to grow . Dora took a stick of sugarless gum from her pocket . Chewing , she looked beyond the duck playground , her playground too , and saw the bridge which connected the highway to the toll road that by-passed the city of Chicago . Sometimes groups including Dora went on the other road in a bus to the Museum of Science and Industry , never to Disneyland . Dora was always dimly aware of the sound of big trucks and buses and cars speeding by .", 'The stranger was big like some of the workmen and he wanted salad bar so Dora went with him while he filed his plate and explained what all the things were .

" OK , OK , " Dora said , bossing back in her way . By the time Dora returned to watch the man again , he had already paid the cashier and gone . The shadow of his truck still loomed through the window . It was his coat she knew still hanging on a peg by the door . She found a pack of candy corn in the pocket and then hurried out to find him .', "Dora let the phone in her mother 's house ring 22 times . Then she ate lunch in the kitchen off a plain white plate . She remembered who the man reminded her of . It was the man who made her bleed . When Dora was a girl she 'd wandered off behind her house to where the railroad crossed a field and though she knew not to go on the tracks themselves - too scary anyway - when a man who was hidden back there like a spider she 'd stared at in a gas station bathroom one day asked her to come sit on his knee , she moved forward . Playing a game for a minute she ran away laughing . Tag           could n't read or write . Without her underpants , young to have a beard down there , he said . No boils then . The next day she began to bleed and even though her mother told her that all women bleed , Dora knew it was because he had touched her there .", "Dora let the phone in her mother 's house ring 50 times . Even Brenda felt sorry for her . Then Dora went out to see about the sirens . She saw policemen crawling inside the man 's truck . Traffic stopped all along the road as far as she could see . There was a flashing light down under the bridge where the man had gone and done something wrong . Dora suddenly saw herself wearing a           was her on her dresser inside a silver frame . Maybe her mother had gotten stuck in one of the honking cars .", '" He ate three pieces of pie , " she told the policeman who was just watching and when he seemed excited by what she \'d said , Dora added , " They told me I could stop bleeding if I wanted .

There was nothing to laugh about this time . She could n't see very well , the stones on the side of the black road , the teeth of a beast . She might trip and be swallowed . Dora walked slowly towards the bridge and though it had only taken then man minutes it took her almost half an hour to get to the stairs . She rolled the sleeves of her sweat shirt up thinking this might be how you catch pneumonia when you do n't feel cold . Right foot , right foot , right foot . She forced herself up the stairs . Tears kept smoothing her face and she wanted to turn back but the man called her , his husky voice over her eyes , inside her ears . A naked man with bleeding feet had died for her too . Secretly she did n't believe that , only this .", "For now she knew . Now when she went back to the commons room and then to her own bedroom where she would pull the blinds , hug her sisters and put her watch inside her jewelry box , she would know why he had jumped waiting for the next day . And when she did n't like something , she might think about what it was like up here on the bridge with the wind blowing about her like God was there . It would be horrible and she would try to laugh or shut her eyes up into a kaleidoscope but other times it would be like she could climb a mountain too if she wanted .

The thought of sleeping with Wendell is a last-ditch hope and consolation , a New Year \'s Eve flight into Auld Lang Syne .', '" But now I \'ll drive you around a bit before we go home . I thought we could walk along the Thames a bit ,           It is simply sparkling , the Thames . There \'s a beautiful bridge , there are the Houses of Parliament .

Oh , what lovely energy , what a new , crisp , delightful , sensuous life .', '" Oh , dear , " says Wendell . " You \'re so swathed in that cape , I never noticed you had a bag anyway .

What a fool . I have to make all those phone calls and feel such an idiot . And he does look annoyed and say in his soft voice worried things about me . " Oh , dear , you have n\'t changed , have you " But then he kisses me on the bed a bit , and we begin to discover one another all over again , laughing and desiring all at once . He runs a bubble bath and both of us get in . Oh , porpoise-like , oh , porpoise in the Thames , how are you ?', 'So when Wendell wrote to say that his marriage was over , I responded to the enticement of beautifully written , witty letters , which began crossing the Atlantic more and more frequently . At last I was the one to make the bold suggestion : " Shall I come visit you in London during my winter break ? " I wrote .', 'But when I telephoned about the dates for my plane flights , a woman answered . " Oh , yes ! " she said cordially . " I \'ll give him the message . " When Wendell called back , I asked about the woman on the phone . " You \'re not living with someone , are you ?

She is here with our yoga teacher , well , I might as well say it , our guru , a brilliant Indian physician who gave up his practice to teach yoga to a growing flock of disciples . Dr. Shanta had a stroke last year and has come to London for speech therapy at a famous clinic . Wendell , of course , has no interest in seeing Mira or Guruji , so we will have a nice separation in our days , as I leave him to his usual projects -- scripts , rehearsals , negotiations -- and make my           entourage are staying .", "And the same thing distracts me now that distracted me then -- my spiritual connection . In those days it was much more intense than it is now , now that I 'm older and have that something called perspective . Then , I was sure I had found the spiritual family , the ideology , that comforted me , gave meaning to my life , and if it was good for me , I was sure that meant it would be good for my children too . I would drag my children to the ashram on weekends and vacations , where we would spend the money we needed for shoes and school clothes , to be part of a community that did n't find us freakish ( single mothers were that rare in our town in those days ) . Our dear friend Peg would be there too happily urging us to use her new Sanskrit name , Mira Bai . I remember the first night we stayed over There was joyous Sanskrit chanting and Mira beaming with love for us           to us The children seemed as enchanted as I , with the candlelight , the music the lively , kindly dark face of Guruji at the center of it all .", 'Now , a dozen years later , he \'s single again , but there \'s a woman           than he let on in our transatlantic phone calls . And my guru and Mira , my oldest spiritual friend , are living with a small group of devotees in a tiny apartment in Belsize Park . I have rushed across the Atlantic to find myself and , once again , I find myself split in two . When Wendell leaves for rehearsal in the morning , I get on the tube for Belsize Park , walk up the shabbily genteel high street , stopping at a little florist \'s shop to buy some freesias , and make my way past the Royal Free Hospital , where Guruji goes each day for post-stroke speech therapy , to the decaying corner building where they live -- Guruji , Mira , and two young devotees . I bang on the door with my gloved fist . " Mittened on it manfully , " I quote Dylan Thomas to myself . At first I pushed the doorbell buttons , but clearly they do n\'t work . The door , though shabby with several peeling colors of paint , with a couple of empty           and sturdy . Though I pound and pound on it , nobody hears me . Just as I am halfway down the path to the street , looking for a phone booth to call them from , the door opens . A round old Indian man with a gray topknot on his head and a big , gap-toothed grin lets me into the building . " Thank you , " I say . " I \'m here to see Dr. Shanta . "', 'I thank him again , and walk across the torn linoleum of the ground-floor hallway , then up the two flights to their floor .', "How much more crowded it must be when all of them are here ! But am lucky this morning , because the others are at the hospital for Guruji 's speech therapy . Mira is alone in her meditation . I am gazing on he heavy eyes with pain and love .", '" I was banging on the door for a good ten minutes , " I say . " But nobody heard me . "', '" I know . I \'m sorry . It took me longer than I thought to find my way . "', '" Churches ? " I say , surprised .', '" Where shall we go today ? " I ask her . " I have n\'t much money -- I lost my purse in my first hour here ! It \'s crazy , but I do n\'t even worry about it , I feel so           be returned to you , " she says decisively . " You \'ll see . " She stands up a little unsteadily , giving her sari a little shake to uncrumple it , then looks up at me with a smile . I laugh , reaching out my hand to steady her . " Well , I do n\'t deserve it , " I say .', '" Oh , we \'re on a small budget here , the four of us , " she says . " But we get along all right . "', '          the moment , " she says , " and then there is n\'t anything left later on . "', '" Oh , they try , " she laughs . " I do believe they try ! It \'s hard , though , I admit it -- hard to be cooped up with Lakshmi and Kamala in this tiny apartment . "', 'As the door opens , Lakshmi and Kamala , two devotees I know from the ashram , come in with Guruji . The two of them seem so much alike at first glance , both with long , uncombed blond hair , both in white saris . Lakshmi is first , holding the door open for Guruji , while Kamala is stooping at his side , helping him remove his black cotton Chinese slippers .', 'We are standing there in a kind of silent , dazzling greeting , as Kamala whisks his coat away and Lakshmi begins clucking about whether there will be enough food for lunch , then interrupts herself . " Oh , I do n\'t mean to be rude , " she says . " It \'s so nice to see you , Claudia . But I am just thinking , how will we make plans for lunch ... "', '" If you do n\'t mind , Guruji , " she says , and he smiles and waves his hand as if to waft us immediately into a delightful adventure .', '" It \'s wonderful to see you , Guruji ! " I say , as Mira pulls her coat from the big wardrobe and comes smiling toward us , ready to show me London .', 'The days and nights pass quickly this way , and I am ever dizzier and more divided , making love with Wendell , then wandering about with Mira Bai and meditating in Belsize Park . But now the lodger has come back , with her little girl . Did I tell you there \'s a little girl ? We are in the old-fashioned basement kitchen where we have all just met . Heather , the child , is a spunky , modern little thing with a spiky , elfin haircut . " Where are you going to sleep ? " she says in her clipped , perfect British child way .', '" But you must sleep somewhere , " says Heather . " Where will Wendell put you ?

It 's obvious we like each other .", "It 's obvious that she loves him . Obvious he does n't deserve it . But maybe I only imagine it .", '" It \'s been so long since I \'ve been in that life , " she laughs , chuckles really , in that funny , almost sensuous way of hers .', '" Oh , how we depressed ourselves that night , " she says . " And really it was all the same thing , was n\'t it ? My dozen and your one , they gave us both such terrible sadness ! "', '" You \'re right , " I say . " You \'ve always understood things when I was baffled . But how can I change things now ? My return flight \'s just a few days away . I \'ll have to stick it out . " " If you need to borrow money for a hotel ... " she begins , but I hush her , for I know she has even less money than I do .', '" There \'s a special one I want to show you , " she agrees .', '" Here , " she says finally . She sinks to the floor in front of it , gazing upward . The look           know what to do . Wo n\'t a guard make her stand up ? But I sink to the floor beside her . " Leonardo da Vinci , " she says softly , " \' The Virgin of the Rocks . \' Look ! "', '" That \'s my grandmother \'s brooch , " Mira says . " I used to wear it all the time , remember ? "', '" But you see the resemblance , do n\'t you ? " says Mira .', '" To me , " she says . " Do n\'t you see it ? " Her voice is different , not my bantering Mira \'s voice but something different that chills me . " I have n\'t told you this before , but an Indian psychic visited us last month -- and he told me I am a reincarnation of Mary . "', '" Not at first , " she says . " Guruji dismissed it , but I think it was a kind of jealousy on his part , for the psychic had a great spiritual power , and urged me to leave Guruji and follow him . "', '" I do n\'t expect you to understand right away , " she says . " But           paintings . The Pieta -- it was the time my brother died , in that accident years ago , and I was holding him in my lap , waiting for the ambulance . I \'ve lived the Pieta a thousand different ways and Gary \'s dying was only the most recent . "', '" Just look at her , " Mira says .', '" But the Virgin does n\'t look like a swimmer , " I say .', "What must I do ? Ask her to come home           do ? But in my mind 's eye , I am simply seeing Mira dive again , at a deep waterfall pool in the Catskills , skinny-dipping with her sisters and cousins . It was the first time I 'd ever been skinny-dipping , and that was plunge enough for me . How I admired Mira , the perfect arc of her lean body plunging so surely past the waterfall , into the dark pool .", "What kind of spiritual ricochet bounced Mira from all this to the Virgin of the Rocks ? Perhaps this cartoonish basement temple was just too big a shock , too big a change for her . Yet even here , the Indian goddesses are more appealing to strong women than the Virgin Mary , are n't they , with           lotuses , their lions underfoot ? For years , even before we began to study yoga , Mira was a kind of goddess to me . She was a divorced single mother ahead of me , and when my husband left me for one of his students , she helped me through the pain , she showed me that it was possible to carry on with dignity , and to find my own way just as she had . Strangely , I was the one who found yoga and introduced her to Guruji -- but she was the one who dived in headfirst , gave up her career , gave her children to their father , so she could spend all her time as his disciple .", 'How is your friend Mira ? " asks Wendell , as we walk back to his house from the tube station late at night . The air is damp and misty , and the high street is a grayness , with pockets of harsh lighting and occasional neon . We have passed a group of rough young men with shaven heads , and heard the sound of bottles breaking , tossed against a wall for fun .', '" But you \'ve known that all along , have n\'t you ? " he says . " Leading this          ', '" Ah , so what is different now ? " he says , smiling at me , striding along quite at home in his north London world .', '" Maybe you \'re growing wiser , " he says . But I know that is n\'t true , not the way he means it , not any way at all , in fact .', '" I did n\'t quite say that , " says Wendell . " You may have misinterpreted a bit . "', '" You must n\'t leave , " he says . " We \'ll have such a lovely time this weekend . I \'m looking forward to it . "', '" We \'re not that close , " he says . " We have an arrangement , we \'re both just alike that way , we have lots of friends . "           the three of us are together , and it \'s not just me . I know it \'s hard for her . " Then I begin to feel angry at her too , for sharing that bath with Wendell . It was clever , though , it makes things clear . " But at least she does n\'t have to hear us , " I say . " We do n\'t make love on the other side of her room , she does n\'t have to listen to us . It was rude of you to do that just now ! "', 'All the way to meet           humiliation and the basement temple in Belsize Park . My life seems lost somewhere between them -- and no hope of being miraculously returned , the way my handbag was . In the old days , Mira and I shared everything , told each other everything . But how can I tell a Leonardo Madonna about my shameful situation , the noises in the bath on the other side of the bedroom wall ? No more than I can tell Wendell about Mira and the Virgin .', '" You \'re late , " she tells me . " We \'ll just barely catch the train ! " As always , I run behind her , down the platform to the train for Cambridge . We laugh as we climb aboard , and find window seats facing each other .', "Soon we are walking across the lawn to Queen 's College , the warm patina of the stone , the glitter of old windows in the wintry sun . The students are still away for the winter break , and most of the doors are locked . Under a stone arcade , we find a brightly lit office , and go in to ask for a key .", '" What a powerful energy here , " she murmurs , closing her eyes .', 'After a few minutes , I hear Mira \'s voice . " I feel myself in all these figures , " she says , looking at a large painting of the Annunciation on the side wall . The Virgin , in voluminous blue draperies , is gazing in surprise and mystery at the skinny angel , who is almost shyly holding out a lily to her . " They have given me so many faces , so many forms . But I find myself           a moment . It is a beautiful idea , somehow . I smile at her . " And I ca n\'t even find one self , " I say .', 'A day later , Friday afternoon , in the warm basement kitchen of Wendell \'s north London row house , Harriet and Wendell and I have been talking painfully . Harriet has just been crying . With rushed apologies , she and Wendell retreat into her little girl Heather \'s room to talk . Heather stays in the kitchen with           bright-eyed child with her short , modern haircut walks up to me with a paper sticker in her hand . She presses it onto my sweater , then goes off to her room . " I want my room back ! " she calls ahead of herself in warning .', "When Harriet and Wendell come back from Heather 's room , all three of us sit down . An embarrassed Wendell makes tea while Harriet and I apologize to one another .", '" Well -- we did n\'t know either , " says Harriet . " Or rather -- we pretended not to .

That I allowed Wendell to drive off to Brighton with me , leaving Harriet , who loved him , to work out her feelings alone with her child in London Leaving Harriet , my fellow feminist to sleep and think alone . And what about my own self-respect ? Where had that fled to           bearing up brightly , Wendell and I drive through storybook villages to Brighton , past the disappointing pavilion with its tawdry onion towers , and find a charming little hotel , where our bodies bid each other farewell . It is such an old friendship , such a " funny glue , " Wendell calls it , that draws us together even when we \'re saying goodbye .', '" I wish you \'d told me , " I say . " Because there was n\'t room at Mira \'s , you know . "', 'I laugh . " Maybe not , " I say           did ? " He smiles at me over his coffee cup , his eyebrows raised half-pleadingly , half-mockingly . We are in the hotel \'s tiny dining room , sitting at a small table near the lace-covered corner window .', '" Nor I , " says Wendell .', '" That remains to be seen , " says Wendell .', '" Oh , I do n\'t know , not that so much . Just -- how I feel about things , I suppose . I do have a conscience of sorts , you know . "', '" I suppose you will , " he smiles , gazing at me affectionately . " I suppose our funny old glue will have to dissolve sometime . "', '" No complications there , " says Wendell .', '" Come , " he says , setting down his cup . " You must see Brighton Pier before we head back . "', "The next day Mira and Wendell meet for the first time in years , as they ride with me together on the train to Gatwick Airport . It is           together . They seem suddenly to like one another , in this festivity of my departure , trading witticisms and laughing at each other 's jokes . I am laughing too , basking in the sweetness of this rare conjunction .", '" No , you give your picture to us , " says Wendell .', '" Only if you take your pictures after me , " I say , and they hedge and demur , and push me into the shiny plastic booth . I smile at the face in the mirror . Fool that she is , she looks unscathed and smiles back at me brightly . She does n\'t tell me what we have learned , though I know there is something . There are buzzes and clicks , and soon I           between myself and my friends , with the help of Mira \'s nail file .', "Soon after this we will learn that Mira has a cruel brain disease , one that leaves her memory , but takes away her reason and finally all ability to function . It was           Leonardo 's Madonna . For a long time I am so devastated , so angry over this , that I blame Guruji , blame all religions and whatever is behind them , East or West -- and I find ways to blame myself , as well . Finally , though , I accept that what betrayed her was not the spiritual lie , but something in her body 's secret workings , something chromosomal , if the latest research is correct .", 'In a lagoon scattered with high , treacherous rocks , a smiling Virgin hands her child to the angel sitting near her , then climbs one o the highest rocks and stands there gazing down , that smile of rapture and adventure in her eyes .

She tried to explain to them what was on the menu . They were amused by her explanation . Each of the four wanted something different . The tray was too small for her to bring the whole order to their table in one trip . When she finally arrived with four portions of French fries , she noticed the headwaiter got there first .

But he replied the garage he rents out brings in a lot more money than the           gate slide open at night . Like the bow of a ferryboat opening . Then she hears a car drive in . The headlights send their light across the ceiling . Then the gate slides slowly shut and the lock clicks . When she 's lying awake she also hears the pump : it starts up at regular intervals , pumping the water that heats the garage .", "The head of personnel asked Sylvia why she fainted .

She has been tossing and turning in bed . She tried to smoke a cigarette . She was scared awake by the alarm before it began to ring . She lay there , counting five minutes a couple of times before she got up .           She asked herself how much longer she will be working in the department store . It reminds her of the first days . While she was cleaning a coffee machine she pulled a rod out of its base and suddenly hot chocolate sauce was running all over the floor . How was she to know they had stored chocolate sauce in the coffee machine ? The cook just told her : " Do n\'t forget to clean the coffee machine .

She had two           Go sit with the turtles . " She sat there for hours , crying . When the children came back from school they were not even allowed to go to her . Now and then he went and stood at the kitchen window while she was sitting there . He did n\'t say a word . Then he came out and gouged out the turtles \' eyes while she had to sit and watch .

" It \'s not that difficult to do the head a little favor . You know how he is . It \'s all he ever thinks about . Men . But he \'s very considerate .

Her hands are rough from the chemical detergents she uses for washing dishes . There is a little salve left in the kitchen . She rolls up the sleeves of her sweater . This morning she burned herself on one of the empty pans that had only just got back from the stove . It 's her own fault . It would n't happen if she stayed away from pans that are not brought to her . Let her stay with her dishes . What possesses her to come and get pans that have n't cooled off yet anyway ? So now she burned herself . She did not dare to breathe a word about it to anyone . She thought it had stopped hurting after a while . She           a blister after all .

That 's because I have to sort the leftovers in those stinking vats . Just the smell of food -- . Ever since she started working in the kitchen she only drinks coffee . And she eats a mandarin orange before she leaves in the morning .", "\n They had the air conditioner on Hi Cool and the whole downstairs smelled of roasting turkey . Friday afternoon . Finn sat in the blue armchair , which rested on Teflon wafers to protect the floor he 'd finally gotten around to sanding and refinishing . With spar varnish , not that damnable polyurethane . He was reading , of all things , Timon of Athens , which he had remembered as being much better . So this would probably be the last time in his life he would read Timon of Athens ; that made it seem sad and precious , if not especially enjoyable . As he read , he also worried : that there would be too many leftovers , that Thanksgiving dinner in July was n't charming but simply outre , that none of the guests would know he 'd been interested in American cooking before it had become fashionable , and that he had been boring James by saying so repeatedly .", '" Plugged-in and passive , " he \'d said . " I \'m the first to admit it . The MTV generation . Before your very eyes . " Affected decadence was one of James \'s comic turns .', '" It \'s camp , what can I say ? " said James . " I thought all faggots were into camp back in your day . "', 'James \'s sister Carolyn lived on the next street , one house over from Finn \'s : their backyards touched at a single point . A year ago today -- or yesterday -- Finn had been out back taking down , at long last , the swing set that had been there when he \'d bought the place . With a sledgehammer he \'d pulverized the concrete plugs that           its side like a dog killed by a car , two stiff legs in the air . He was trying to decide whether it could be knocked apart with the hammer or whether he \'d have to take a hacksaw to it when he noticed this -- Finn hated the expression " young man " -- dressed only in shorts and running shoes mowing the Sykes \'s lawn . Finn nodded and received a nod in return . Carolyn had forewarned him that her brother would be coming up to stay in the house for a few days while she and Peter were in Umbria , and encouraged him to go over and introduce himself . It seemed uncivil not to make use of this opportunity , but the brother \'s very good looks made Finn disinclined . That night , Wed or Thurs , he went to what he still thought of as the Central but was now called the Symposium : the musty , velvety old theater in town had become a revival house with air-popped popcorn and a beer-and-wine license , run by a graduate-school dropout convinced           of him in the ticket line was the young man . When he turned away from the window with his ticket , he saw Finn , smiled and nodded , and walked over .', '" Well , that makes one of us , " said Finn . " However . Yes . And I think you \'re the person who was so diligently mowing the Sykes \'s lawn this afternoon . "', '" Yes , Carolyn had prepared me , " said Finn . " Somewhat . " Should he have ? Well , it was said now . " I ought to have come over and said hello , but I was preoccupied . "', '" That was my John Henry mode , " said Finn . " Otherwise I \'m harmless enough . So Peter and Carolyn           traipse around sunny Italy . "', '" Ah , " said Finn . " Here , why do n\'t we go in ? " Was he overreacting , or was this a bit gauche of Carolyn Sykes , to have steered this obviously gay boy in his direction when the first move , if any , ought to have been Finn \'s ? On the other hand , he could n\'t afford to think ill of Carolyn Sykes : except for poor Byron Solomon , and of course now the Whitleys , Peter and Carolyn were as close as Finn had to friends in this community . As Carolyn undoubtedly knew . Which was why she had taken such a liberty . Although she had surely meant well . ( There : he was coming around already . ) And as to the boy \'s being obviously gay , would that have been so           know it ? One \'s family had a gift for not knowing these things , or so it had been in Finn \'s family . This brother of Carolyn \'s was certainly presentable -- whatever he meant by that -- and obviously conversable .', '" It really was n\'t all that hot , was it ? " said James Chase . " God , I feel like a heretic . "', '" I must have heard it , " said James Chase . " But , you know . I \'m into Garth . Mr. Va Va Voom . "', '" Always , " he said .', "Later that same night -- actually it was beginning to turn gray outside the windows -- when they got around to comparing stories , Finn 's misgivings came back more sharply . James had been vague about his involvements in New York , but from what Finn could gather it was clear that he might really have been taking his life in his hands with this boy . But truly , was n't AIDS simply the extreme , the mortal , instance of what had always been the case : that your new love 's irrevocable past determined your future ? But this James was his first adventure -- was it possible ? -- since he 'd moved here . Finn was so out of touch that he did n't even have a condom in the house . James , thank God , had come equipped ( despite what he 'd promised himself )           flamboyantly heterosexual boys of Finn 's high-school days .", 'That first night , with Kitty Wells keening , it had been James who committed himself first : he took a deep breath , put a warm hand on the back of Finn \'s neck and pulled him close . Yet it had been James who had said , " I want to put this on you , can I ?           had all the power . That is , if you believed it was all about who fucked who .', 'Finn , still holding his book , rolled his wrist to check his watch . Ten after four , which of course had no bearing on the question . " I told \' em all six o\'clock , " he said . " I hate this malarkey where you have one coming at six o\'clock and one at six-fifteen and so forth . " It was endearing that anyone could still get the willies from Edgar Allan Poe .', '" I \'ll leave that , " said James , " to your discretion . "', '" Actually I might come up and join you , " said Finn . " I \'m pretty much at a stopping-place . Just let me baste Junior again . "', '" Now what \'s all this ? " said Finn .', '" Nothing , " said James . " I must be on the rag . "', '" Am I being unreasonable ? " said Finn . Like a damn fool . " To want to know what I \'m being told ? "', '" And what is that supposed to mean ? "', 'Finn closed his eyes for a count of three and blew out his breath for James to hear .', '" Why are you doing it ? " said Finn .', '" Right , " said James . He started up the stairs , then stopped and looked back . " Hey Finn ? " he said . " You would be welcome to tuck me in .

Or had been until six years ago , when he was looking for a place to land and was approached by the college \'s Department of Communication Arts . That was the year his film about children \'s street games had been nominated for an Academy Award . He \'d meant to show these children ( filmed in Newark , Liverpool , Mexico City and Connecticut ) as members of a savage tribe with alien customs and ceremonies ; it had bothered him , therefore , that two of the three reviews he \'d gotten had called it " sensitive . " For whatever reason , he had n\'t been able to get going on a new project since . It was his course load , his inability to travel . It was the too-comfortable life here : dinner parties with tolerant acquaintances in a tolerant college town . It was his house , the first he \'d ever owned , which had needed everything done to it           he did have a new project in mind . Which would damn well not be called " sensitive , " either . And which would get him once and for all , at the age of fifty-two , out of the closet , not that he was truly in the closet . ( James gave him guff about that , but that was just James . ) Finn had ignored the whole Stonewall business and everything thereafter ; bully for them , of course , but . He was damned if he \'d be ghettoized as a quote unquote gay filmmaker ; his work was not political . Lately , though , he was beginning to wonder whether avoiding the subject of homosexuality in his films -- well , not avoiding , just not obsessing -- had n\'t been a mistake . A mistake aesthetically . When he looked at his old work nowadays ( which was n\'t often ) it felt impersonal to him . Put-together to a fare-thee-well , of course . But surely there was a way to get closer in without being either confessional or ,           old to want to .', 'He \'d gone so far as to begin collecting videos ; he \'d also written part of a first draft of an essay on the implicit formal conventions of pornography . If he could finish this and get it decently published -- he \'d try Film Quarterly first , obviously , then Sight and Sound-it might help with the funding . The biggest problem , aside from outright censorship --           that these days such a subject could only be a downer : even safe-sex porn had a sort of " Masque of the Red Death " feel about it . Which was all to the good as far as the film was concerned . But it made the project a tougher sell , even with the Award nomination . If anyone still remembered it .', '" If I could get a grant from General Motors , " said Finn .', '" You \'ve lived in New York too long , " said Finn . " I \'ve never encountered the least -- I mean I do n\'t go to workingmen \'s bars on', 'James was still looking at him . " You are so blind , man , " he said . Finn had never seem him this exercised . And only once before had James called him " man . "', '" Listen , man           good enough for you when you picked me up at the movies . " James had had a gin and tonic on the plane .', '" You do n\'t know how lucky you are , " said James . " You \'re getting a live-in slut all your own , man , complete with checkered past . Just do n\'t push it . "', 'Finn dropped into his Zen pedagogical manner . " Just by looking at it , " he said .', '" Of course when I first saw it listed , " Byron Solomon was saying , " I was quite humiliated . "', '" Worked flatters the case , I think , " said Byron . " At any rate , I very nearly made a great fool of myself by calling them up and lacing into them about it . Jeannette , of course , talked me around . She said , \' Good heavens \' -- you remember -- \' Good heavens , how were they to know ? \' Because naturally for mere movies I never used Byron Solomon . Never sullied the great name . " He laughed . It did n\'t sound bitter , and Finn wondered if that was even more depressing . " So she said , \' How were they to know , for heaven \'s sake . \' You remember the way she was . "', '" God yes , I can hear her now , " said Finn , throwing in a chuckle to boot , though           than Jeannette ; Byron Solomon , after all , had n\'t been much of an actor . Bill Whitley , like the other newer faculty , tended to treat Byron as if he were senile , which was terribly unfair . It was true that he had slipped a bit since Jeannette died . But the man had to be sixty-five : who did n\'t slip ? Really , Finn should have exerted himself more to find Byron a dinner partner . But one no longer worried about pairing people of for dinners , just as one no longer worried about going boy-girl-boy-girl at table , although Finn in fact had seated Carolyn between himself and Bill Whitley , and Deborah Whitley between himself and Peter Sykes .', 'Susan somebody ? Lovely girl -- who had in turn called the fellow at the theater and arranged the whole thing . Jeannette had been prepared to drag me there bodily , if necessary , sick as she was . Well , let me tell you , it was like the Ed Sullivan Show . Toneet in air steeyewdio audience ... " Even Byron \'s Ed Sullivan was no good .', 'James began mixing in his cranberries , turning the whole mess gray . Finn leaned over to Carolyn and said , " I think your brother \'s attention span has reached its limit . I should never have put him between Byron and Bill . " Before Byron had gotten the floor , Bill Whitley had been holding forth on Simon Callow . Which Finn could n\'t help but think punningly appropriate , though to say so later to James would be a cheap shot .', '" Suppose I mobilize him to help me clear , " said Carolyn to Finn . " Meanwhile you can rescue poor Deborah . "', "Finn admired Carolyn for her civilized pretense that her husband was a bore , bending the unwilling ear of the large-breasted , precariously halter-topped Deborah Whitley . Carolyn 's intelligence would probably get her through until her looks began to go . Good Christ           nodded off in Finn 's chair ; then his eyes flew open and he said he guessed he 'd better toddle along . The Whitleys had brought him , but Bill looked so crestfallen -- Finn was flattered that he was enjoying himself but appalled by his bad manners-that Peter Sykes offered to drive Byron home . This jogged Bill into a belated sense of the decencies , and that was it for the evening : one could n't very well ask Peter and Carolyn to stay on with the Whitleys standing right there . Carolyn offered to help with the cleanup , but Finn would n't hear of it . She said she 'd be glad to . Finn said they had things well in hand .", '" Shoo , " said James . " No girls allowed . "', 'James rolled his           " to be alone . "', 'After closing the door on all of them , Finn turned to James and said , " There was no need to be brutal . Could n\'t you see she was upset ? "', '" Oh come , " said Finn . " Even you could n\'t have missed what was going on at dinner . I assure you your sister took note . "', '" This was a social evening , " said Finn , hating this tone he was being maneuvered into taking . " I do n\'t regard that as giving people license to hurt           " said James . " Well I guess that tells me . The Queen of Feelings has spoken . " He walked into the kitchen with that walk Finn hated . That goddamn faggot walk , where the shoulders did n\'t move . The fourth bottle of Montalcino -- Finn also hated white wine -- had just about that much left . He picked it up , glanced at the kitchen doorway , and polished it off . What would the Italian be for A meme la bouteille ? He carried the dead soldier into the kitchen , not even looking at James ( who fetched a loud sigh as he bent over the dishwasher ) , and on through into the mud-room , where he dropped it , clank , in with the green glass . All this environmental malarkey was accomplishing exactly nothing -- Was he the only one who noticed it hardly snowed up here in the winter anymore ? -- except to give a bunch of small people the power to tyrannize you when you went to the dump . Even grocery bags had turned self-righteous           around . Finn hated that " we . "', '" No-no-no , " said Finn , who \'d just come in from the backyard . " I \'ve been up since seven-thirty . " He looked at his watch : eleven on the dot . " Did n\'t you see me out back with my trusty wheelbarrow ? That bloody sandpile is finally going the way of the swing set . This time next year we \'ll have a civilized backyard , by Jesus . " He hated saying " we " to Carolyn , but " I " would have been worse . " Did the Rinaldi children really play on that flimsy little swing set ? "', '" Listen , Finn ? " said Carolyn . " There \'s something -- listen , James is n\'t standing right there , is he ? "', '" No , " she said . " No , what I mean is , could I talk to you about something ? "', '" There was a message on the machine when we got home last night , " said Carolyn . Finn           cigarettes were over there on the counter , far out of reach . " My father went in for some tests a couple of weeks ago . And now they want him to go back and have some more done . And -- you know , it just does n\'t sound very good . "', '" Well , he \'s had , you know , rectal bleeding .... "', '" And I just thought James ought to be told . "', '" Well ... , " she said .', '" Well , I guess it \'s been a little better since -- you know , since he \'s been living up here , " said Carolyn . " If anything , they \'re           ? " said Finn . He put the receiver down , wedging it between the heavy cut-glass flower vase and the diner-style metal napkin dispenser so the tension in the cord would n\'t pull it off onto the floor , went over and fetched his cigarettes .', '" Well , " she said . " I \'m just trying to , you know , wait to hear something concrete and not panic until there \'s actually something to panic about . "', '" So do I , " she said . Then she said , " I \'m sorry about your father . "', '" No , " she said . " I think at this point all it would do is get everybody upset . You know , people showing up like ... " Had she been going to say vultures ? " Besides , Fort Myers is n\'t all that divine in July . But I do think that if he would call or write -- I do n\'t know ,           only for his own sake , you know ? Like later on . "', '" I think he really is very ill . I just -- something just tells me that . "', '" I will , " she said . " Thank you . "', '" So what \'s going on ? " said James . Finn turned : James was standing , barefoot , in the archway leading to the dining room .', '" And say what ? "', 'James went to the refrigerator , took out the carton of orange juice and drank from it . " Sort of tests are we talking about ? "', '" That figures , " said James . " So we \'re talking about cancer . "', 'James said , " I want to talk to my sister . "', "The drive down to JFK used to take Finn four and a half hours ; today it had taken five . He no longer had the energy -- no , the foolhardiness -- to roll seventy and seventy-five all the way . Even so , he was half an hour early , so he tried to get comfortable on the narrow aluminum ledge of a giant window near the security station , and to involve himself in the last act of Timon of Athens . He 'd deliberately brought nothing else : damned if he would allow himself to get that far and not finish . But how was he to concentrate ? About fifty other people were clustered here , including whole families with whining children ; some sat against the wall , some paced , some just stood and shifted their weight from foot to foot           and down to the gates where there were seats . And ordinary people , waiting for their loved ones , were denied a modicum of comfort all because -- well , enough . It was unattractive to be querulous .", "direct flight . Getting to Albany would have involved shuttling from JFK to La Guardia , sitting at La Guardia for another two hours -- ridiculous . If the lights started to bother Finn 's eyes on the drive back , they could always stop and put up at a motel . He 'd also driven all the way down here because he wanted to make another foray into Times Square .", "He could n't concentrate on Timon of Athens .", "Finn gave him a brotherly one-armed hug . James bent to lay the oranges on the floor , straightened up , gripped the back of Finn 's neck and kissed him on the lips .", '" Forgive an old man , " said Finn , giving his still-one-armed hug another pump . " When ye git my age , sonny .... "', "Finn let go . James 's tan , he noticed , was even deeper than when he 'd left . So something more had been going on , apparently , than just the compulsive TV-watching and the silent family dinners he 'd re-created so amusingly on the phone           said Finn , bending to pick up the oranges .", '" Well well well , " said Finn . " God and sinners reconciled . But would n\'t pink grapefruit have been more appropriate ? "', '" Your tan looks splendid , " he said , catching up . " So how are the beach girls down there ? Really stacked , I \'ll bet . "', '" Hey Finn ? " said James . " Why do n\'t you give it a rest , O.K. ? I \'m just really not up to it . It \'s been a bad week .

This is n\'t a project , for Christ \'s sake . It \'s one more old queen who likes to watch young dudes get it on . You can dignify it because you used to be some hot-shit filmmaker .

Not sobbing , just letting the tears go down his face .", "James had been back almost a week before Finn had time to sit down and go           Made time , he corrected himself . But James had come down with a summer cold , Finn did have to nurse him , bring him ice cream and ginger ale and magazines , go to the drug store for cough syrup and Comtrex . And they did have to ask Peter and Carolyn over to hear James 's report and to discuss what might have to be done in the time remaining . Which of course involved preparing a decent meal , and what with the shopping and the cooking that was another day shot to hell . And the lawn had needed another mowing : he 'd neglected it the week before .", 'Finn suddenly felt sick to his stomach : these were only the opening minutes of a sixty-minute film . He hit Stop and the screen went snowy . Was his discomfort a sign that here was something worth his attention ? Had he needed to turn the thing off because it was too powerful ?           without significance ? Why did these films fascinate him ? Did they fascinate him , or was he in fact burned out and desperately willing himself to be fascinated ?', 'Perhaps the thing to do was to look at something less harrowing and allow his unconscious to process this .', 'The premise of Sean in Love was that " Sean , " a Wall Street type -- there was some malarkey at the beginning about " mergers " -- took an           what-not .

In the third such fantasy he was in a sauna getting fucked by a Nautilus instructor -- it seemed to Finn that the wooden bench must have been hell on his back and shoulders -- when there was a cut to outside the door ( through which their stagy moans could still be heard ) where a third young man , in tight shorts , was reaching for the door handle . ( This annoyed Finn : up to now the fantasies had been presented strictly from Sean \'s point of view . ) " Oopsy-daisy , " said the intruder -- and Finn leaned forward . Cut from their surprised faces to the smiling face of the intruder : James , of course , of course , of course . Younger , but James .

Then noon is already around and I go downstairs to           and in the afternoon a friend will come , and together we will come to the same veranda and he will incessantly talk of his wife and children . And when night comes , he leaves , with a hunched back and shoulders that seem to carry the weight of a mountain , I must go downstairs and lie down , hoping that tomorrow I might wake earlier and again draw a new margin , and maybe this time it will work . That 's all there is . It must work . Otherwise in a day or two , or else on the sixteenth or the seventeenth of December , Shirin 's card will arrive , with its cold weather pines and that yellow dot sitting in for the sun , and the foreground of cultivated land , with a little brook on the edge , and no telling where its blue waters are flowing to , just like the way she moves . And her profile is bright , just like a halo that envelops the whole of the human body , even if parts of it have           her from getting ready and going where she must , just like me , who must return to my room and once again face my easel and see how I can place outside the halo of the frame all that I have sketched and much of what I have crossed , so that only she will remain , pedalling into the wind .

All the other children had done their homework at the kitchen table and had n\'t it been fine ? But Fran said it had not been fine . She had left school at 15 ; it had taken years for her to work her way up to a position of seniority , and there were still huge gaps in her education . The three boys had barely scraped by , two working in England and one a roadie with a pop group . It was as if Fran had a mission to get Kathy to make more of herself than the           that she was letting Fran down . " You see , I \'m not really bright , Fran . Things do n\'t come to me like they do to some . You would n\'t believe how quick Harriet is . " " Well , her father \'s a teacher , why would n\'t she be bright ? " Fran sniffed . " You \'re so good to me , Fran . When you should be dancing , you take time for my homework , and I \'m so afraid I \'ll fail and be a disgrace to you after all your work . " " I do n\'t want to go dancing , " Fran would sigh . Kathy was 16 , the baby of the family . Fran was 32 , the eldest . She really should be married now with a home of her own , and yet Kathy never wanted Fran to leave . Home life would be unthinkable without her . Their mam was out a lot " getting things done , " which really meant playing slot machines . There would have been few comforts           them . It was Fran who bought Kathy \'s school uniform , explained the facts of life to her , took her to the theater and through the shops . And there was never a word of criticism from Fran about their parents . Sometimes , Kathy complained : " Mam takes you for granted , Fran . You bought her a lovely new cooker , and she still never makes anything in it . And Dad never says thank you when you bring him beer from the supermarket . He never brings you a present . " " He \'s not the worst , " Fran said . " It \'s not a great life with your head stuck down pipes all the time . " " Will you get married , do you think ? " Kathy asked her once anxiously . " I \'ll wait until you \'re a grown-up , then I \'ll put my mind to it . " Fran laughed when she said it . " But wo n\'t you be too old ? " " Not at all . By the time you           my prime , " she assured her sister . " I thought you were going to marry Ken , " Kathy had said . " Yes , well , I did n\'t . And he went to America , so he \'s out of the picture . " Fran was brusque . Ken had worked in the supermarket too . Mam and Dad said that he and Fran were sure to make a go of it . Kathy had been very relieved when Ken had left the picture . NEITHER OF KATHY \'S PARENTS WAS ABLE to go to the end-of-the-year parentteacher meeting . So Fran went and spoke about her little sister to the tired teachers , who had to see legions of parents and give a message of encouragement laced with caution to all . " She \'s too serious , " they told Fran . " She tries too hard . She might take in more if she were to relax . " " She \'s very interested , really she is , " Fran said . " She never neglects any of her homework . "           ? " Mr. Dunne asked . " No , she does n\'t want to take the time from her studying , you see . " " Maybe she should . " He was brusque , but pleasant . " I do n\'t think she should continue with Latin . " Fran \'s heart sank . " But , Mr. Dunne , she tries so hard . She really does put in hours on it . Could I get her private lessons ? It would be great for her to have Latin . Look at all the places she could go with a subject like that . " " She may never go to a university . " Poor Mr. Dunne was trying to let her down lightly . " But she has to . None of us have got anywhere , she must get a start in life . " " You have a good job yourself , Miss Clarke . I see you when I go to the supermarket . Could n\'t you get Kathy a job there ? " " Kathy will never work in the supermarket .           sorry , " he said quietly . " No , I \'m sorry . It \'s kind of you to take such an interest . Please forgive me for shouting . Just advise me what would be best for her . " " She should do something that she would enjoy , that she would n\'t have to strain at , " Mr. Dunne said . " A musical instrument , has she shown any interest ? " " No . " Fran shook her head . " We \'re all tone-deaf , even the brother who \'s working for a pop group . " " Or painting ? " " I ca n\'t see it myself-she \'d only fret over that too . " It was easy to talk to this kind man . It was good of him to care that poor Kathy should be happy and relaxed . She hated being so negative to his suggestions . " Well , I \'m sure you \'ll think of something , Miss Clarke . " Mr. Dunne looked beyond her to the line of parents still to be seen           . " Fran meant it . " You really do give your time , and care about the children . " Fran went to the bus stop , hands in pockets and head down . She passed through an annex on the way out and saw a notice announcing Italian lessons next September , an introductory course to the food , paintings , music , and language . It promised to be fun as well as educational . Fran wondered if something like that might be a good idea . But it was too dear . She had so many expenses . It would be hard to pay in advance . And suppose Kathy decided to take the whole thing too seriously ? Then the cure might be worse than the disease . No , she would have to think of something else . At the bus stop , Fran met Peggy Sullivan , a checker at the supermarket . " They \'d put years on you , these meetings , would n\'t they ? " the woman said . " There \'s a lot of hanging about , but           one knew where we were half the time . How \'s your own fellow getting on ? " As manager , Fran had made it her business to know as much about the staff as possible . She knew that Peggy had two children , both of them trials . A grown daughter , who did n\'t get on with the father , and a youngster , Jerry , who would n\'t open a book . " Well , apparently , he \'s much improved . All the teachers said so . " " That \'s good news . " " Yes , and it \'s all thanks to this woman we have living with us . Not a word to anyone , Miss Clarke , but we have a lodger , half Italian , half Irish . Says she was married to an Italian and he died , but that \'s not true at all . I think she \'s a nun in disguise . But anyway , did n\'t she take an interest in Jerry ? She has him a changed lad it would appear . " Peggy           that poetry was meant to mean something until Signora came to the house , and this had made all the difference . His English teacher was delighted with him . And Jerry had n\'t understood that history really happened , and now he did , and that had made all the difference . Fran thought sadly that her own sister had not realized that Latin was a language people once spoke . Perhaps this Signora might open doors for her too . " What does she do for a living , your lodger ? " she asked . " Oh , you \'d need a fleet of detectives to find out . A bit of sewing here , and a bit of work up in a hospital , I believe . But she \'s going to be teaching an Italian class next term , and she \'s high as a kite over it , singing little Italian songs . She \'s spending the whole summer getting ready for it . Nicest woman that ever wore shoe leather , but off-the-wall , I tell you , off-the-wall . " Fran decided           course . She and Kathy would go every Tuesday and Thursday . They \'d learn Italian , and they \'d enjoy it , with this madwoman who was singing songs and getting ready so excitedly . It might make Kathy relax a bit , and for herself , it might help her to forget Ken , who had gone to America without her . " THEY SAID KATHY WAS A GREAT GIRL , " Fran said proudly at the kitchen table . Her mother , despondent over some heavy losses , tried to show enthusiasm . " Well , why would n\'t they ? She is a great girl . " " They did n\'t say anything bad about me ? " Kathy asked . " No , they did n\'t . They said it was a pleasure to teach you . So now ! " " I \'d like to have been there , child , " their father said , " it \'s just that I did n\'t think I \'d get off in time . " Kathy and Fran forgave him . It did n\'t matter now           Kathy , " Fran announced . " We \'re going to learn Italian . Yourself and myself . " If she had suggested they fly to the moon , nothing could have surprised the Clarke family more . Kathy flushed with pleasure . " The two of us ? " " Why not ? I always fancied going to Italy , and would n\'t my chances of picking up an Italian fellow be much better if I could speak the language ! " " Would I be able to learn it ? " " Of course . You \'ll probably be top of the class . But it \'s meant to be fun . There \'s this woman teacher , and she \'s going to play us operas and show us pictures , and give us Italian food . It \'ll be terrific . " " It \'s not very expensive , is it , Fran ? " " No , it \'s not , and look at the value we \'ll get from it , " said Fran , wondering if she was verging on madness herself . DURING           in New York state . He wrote to Fran : I love you . I will always love you . I do understand about Kathy , but could n\'t you come here ? We could have her out for the holidays , you could teach her then . Please say yes before I get a little flat for myself . Say yes , and we \'ll get a little house . She \'s 16 , Fran . I ca n\'t wait years for you . Fran wept over the letter , but she could n\'t leave Kathy . This had been her dream , to see one of the Clarkes get to a university . True , Ken had said wait until their children were born , then they could give them all the chances in the world , but Ken did n\'t understand . She had invested too much in Kathy , had raised the girl \'s hopes . She could n\'t go now and leave her to her mother , who would look up vaguely from the gambling machines , and her father , who would mean well           the few simple comforts he wanted from life . Kathy would drown without her . IT WAS A WARM SUMMER . VISITORS CAME to Ireland in great numbers . The supermarket arranged special take-out picnic lunches . It had been Fran \'s idea . It was a terrific success . On her days off , Fran took Kathy on outings . One day , they went on a threehour bus tour of Dublin . " Just so we know about where we live , " Fran had said . " Imagine , we \'re the only Irish people on the bus , " Kathy whispered . " The others are all visitors . " Without being too bossy , Fran also organized Kathy into buying some smart cotton dresses , and talked her into getting her hair cut . By the middle of the summer , Kathy was tanned and attractive , and her eyes began to lose their haunted look . Kathy did have friends , Fran noticed , but not close , giggly friends as she had known when she was 16 . Some of Kathy \'s friends           place , Fran knew from the youngsters at work , that was not well run and where , she suspected , drugs circulated . She could n\'t forbid Kathy to go and make the girl feel like a victim , but she could happen to be passing by at one o\'clock in the morning to collect her . She asked Barry , one of the young delivery van drivers at the supermarket , to pick her up and drive past the disco , offering him overtime pay for the job . " I can have you act as an excuse to get my sister home , " she told him . Barry was a great kid , and mad for the overtime since he wanted to buy a motorbike . " And what do you want it for ? " Fran asked one night as they waited outside the disco . " For freedom , Miss Clarke , " he said . " You know , all that air rushing past and everything . " Fran felt very old . " My sister and I are going to learn Italian           \'s great , Miss Clarke . I \'d like to do that myself . I went to Italy once . I made the greatest friends . " " Maybe you \'ll learn Italian too . " She spoke absently . She was watching tough-looking people come out of the disco . Why did Kathy and her friends want to go there ? " I might if I have the bike paid for , because one of the first places I \'m going to take it is Italy , " Barry said . " Well , the class is at the Mountainview School . It begins in September . " She spoke in a distracted tone because she had just seen Kathy , Harriet , and their friends come out . She leaned across the seat and hooted the horn . Immediately , the girls looked over . The Saturday night lift home was becoming part of the regular scene . What about the parents of these girls ? Fran thought . Did any of them care ? Or was she just a fusspot ? Lord , it would be a           . THE ITALIAN CLASSES BEGAN ON A Tuesday at seven o\'clock . There had been a letter from Ken that morning . He was settled in his little apartment ; in America , he wrote , a flat did n\'t mean a flat ; it meant a flat tire . People were very friendly , they invited him to their homes . Soon it would be Labor Day , and they would have a picnic to mark that the summer was over . He missed her . Did she miss him ? There were 30 people in the class . Everyone got a huge piece of cardboard to put their names on , but the marvelous woman leading the class said they should be called by the Italian version . So Fran became Francesca , and Kathy , Caterina . Everybody made a great game of shaking hands and exchanging names . Kathy seemed to be enjoying it hugely . It would be worth it in the end , Fran told herself , putting out of her mind the thought of Ken going to Labor Day picnics . " Hey           ? Is n\'t that Barry from your supermarket ? " It was indeed . Fran was pleased , the overtime must have been enough for the bike . They waved at each other across the room . What an extraordinary assortment of people . There was that elegant woman , the one who gave lunches at her house and was always in the paper . What on earth could she be doing at a place like this ? And the beautiful girl with the golden curls , Elisabetta , and her nice boyfriend in his good suit . And the dark , violent-looking Luigi and the older man called Lorenzo . What an amazing mixture . And Signora was delightful . " I know your landlady , " Fran said to her when they were having little snacks of salami and cheese . " Yes , well , Mrs. Sullivan is a relation , " Signora said nervously . " Of course . " Fran was reassuring . " She said you were very helpful to her son . " Signora \'s face broke into a wide smile . She           think she could be a nun . She was sure Peggy Sullivan had gotten it wrong . THEY LOVED THE LESSONS , FRAN AND Kathy . They went together on the bus , laughing like children at their mispronunciations and at the stories Signora told them . There was an extraordinary bond among the people in the class . It was as if they were on a desert island and their only hope of rescue was to learn the language and remember everything they were taught . Possibly because Signora believed that they were all capable of great feats , they began to believe it too . She begged them to use the Italian words for everything . They found themselves saying they had to get back to the casa or that the camera was very warm or that they were stanca instead of tired . And all the time , Signora watched and listened , pleased but not surprised . She had never thought that anyone faced with the Italian language would feel anything but delight and enthusiasm for it . MISS JOSIE HAYES , THE HISTORY TEACHER ,           patrons of the arts . " Can anyone think of the people that they sponsored ? " The children looked at each other blankly . " What are the names of some of the famous artists of Italy , do you know ? " Kathy Clarke raised her hand . " One of the most important was Michelangelo . One of the Medicis , Pope Sixtus the fifth , asked Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel . " In a confident voice , she told the class about the scaffolding that was built , the rows and the fallingsout , the problems that there still were in keeping the colors alive . She did n\'t frown , she showed only enthusiasm , and she went further than Miss Hayes could have expected . " Thank you , Katherine Clarke . Now , can anyone else name another artist of the period ? " Kathy \'s hand went up again . The teacher looked around , but there were no other takers . The boys and girls looked on , amazed , as Kathy explained about Leonardo da Vinci and his           writing , maybe because he was lefthanded , or maybe because he wanted them kept secret . Later , in the teachers " lounge , Josie Hayes said : " Those Italian culture classes must be something else . Today , I had Kathy Clarke giving me a rundown of the Renaissance like nobody \'s ever heard . " Across the room , Aidan Dunne , who had dreamed up the idea for the Italian classes and enlisted Signora to teach them , stirred his coffee and smiled to himself , a big happy smile . KATHY CLARKE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF Signora \'s students , eager to learn , and attractive , too , in a blue-eyed , darkhaired way . Sometimes she saw the girl studying in the library and wondered if she had hopes of a higher education . " What does your mother think you might do when you leave school ? " she asked Kathy one evening when they were tidying up the chairs after class . " My mother ? " Kathy seemed surprised . " Yes , she seems so eager and enthusiastic           she does n\'t really know much about the school or what I \'m doing . " " But she comes here to the class with you , does n\'t she ? And she goes out to work in the supermarket ? Mrs. Sullivan where I stay says she \'s the manager . " " Oh , that \'s Fran . She \'s my sister , " Kathy said . Signora looked puzzled . " I \'m so sorry . I get everything wrong . " " No , it \'s an easy mistake . " Kathy was anxious for the older woman not to be embarrassed . " Fran \'s the oldest of the family , I \'m the youngest . " Kathy did n\'t say anything to Fran about it . No point in making Fran go to the mirror to look for lines . Poor Signora was a bit absentminded , and she did get a lot of things wrong . But she was a marvelous teacher . Everyone in the class loved her . THERE WAS A BAD RAINSTORM IN OCtober , and water leaked in the           to cope with it by moving tables out of the way and finding a bucket in one of the cloakrooms . All the time , they shouted , " Che tempaccio " at each other , and " Che bruto tempo . " Connie , the elegant woman with the expensive jewelry , said she could give Fran and Kathy a lift , and after class , they scrambled into her beautiful BMW . Fran , in front , gave directions . This was not the kind of territory that would be familiar to Connie . When they got to the house , Fran saw her mother putting out the trash , wearing the same scuffed slippers and sloppy housecoat that she wore all the time , a cigarette in her mouth despite the rain . Fran then felt ashamed for feeling ashamed of her mother . Her mother had had a hard life and had been generous and understanding when it was needed . " There \'s Mam getting drenched , " Fran said . " Could n\'t the trash have waited till the morning ? " " Che           " Go on , Caterina . Your granny \'s holding the door open for you , " Connie said . " That \'s my mother , " Kathy said . There was so much rain and confusion of banging doors , nobody seemed to take much notice . Inside the house , Mrs. Clarke was looking with surprise at her wet cigarette . " I got drowned waiting for you to come in from that limousine . " " Let \'s have a cup of tea , " said Fran , running to the kettle . Kathy sat down suddenly at the kitchen table . " Due tazze di te , " Fran said in her best Italian . " Come on , Kathy . Con latte ? Con zucchero ? " " You know I do n\'t take milk and sugar . " Kathy \'s voice was remote . She looked very pale . Mrs. Clarke said there was no point in a person staying up if this is all you were to hear , so she was off to her bed . And she was gone , complaining           it , Kathy ? " Kathy looked at her . " Are you my mother , Fran ? " There was silence in the kitchen . They could hear the flushing of the lavatory upstairs and the rain falling outside . " Why do you ask this now ? " " I want to know . Are you ? " " You know I am , Kathy . " A long silence . " No , I did n\'t know . Not until just now . " Fran came toward her , reaching out . " Kathy , you knew , you felt it . It did n\'t need to be said . I thought you knew . " " Does everyone else know ? " " What do you mean , everyone else ? The people who need to , know . You know how much I love you , how I \'d do everything for you and get you the best that I could . " Kathy shook her head as if to clear it , to take this new and frightening knowledge out of her mind .           How would I have known ? We both called Mam and Dad , Mam and Dad . You were my sister . Matt and young Joe and Sean were my brothers . How was I to know ? " " Well , it was n\'t a big thing . We were all together in the house , you were only seven years younger than Joe , it was the natural way to do things . " " Do all the neighbors know ? " " Some of them maybe . They \'ve forgotten , I imagine . " " And who was my father ? My real father ? " Fran knew she needed more tact and diplomacy than had ever been called on in work , and this was vastly more important . " He was a boy who was at a posh school , and his parents did n\'t want him to marry me , " she said . " Now , let \'s have some tea and talk . I \'ll tell you every single thing you want to know . And if Dad comes in in           to your room . " She sounded so calm that she stopped Kathy in the slightly hysterical tone she was taking . After she poured the tea into two mugs , Fran sat down , and said : " I have loved you every day of your life , and , honestly , it got blurred whether you were my sister or my daughter . You \'re just . Kathy to me , and I want the very best for you . I \'ve worked hard so I could provide a good living for us . I \'ve saved a little every week , not much , but enough to start you off well . " Tears came to Kathy \'s eyes . Fran reached over and patted the hand that clutched the mug of tea . " Ask me anything . " " What \'s his name ? " " Paul Malone . " " And how old was he then ? " " Sixteen . I was fifteen and a half . " " You loved him ? " " Yes , very much indeed . I was           , and so did he . I wo n\'t dismiss it and say it was nonsense . It was n\'t . " " Where did you meet him ? " " At a pop concert . We got on so well . I used to sneak out from school to meet him and we \'d go to the pictures . It was a wonderful , happy time . " " And then ? " " And then I realized I was pregnant , and Paul told his mother and father , and I told Man and Dad , and all hell broke out . " " Did anyone talk about getting married ? " " No , nobody talked about it . I thought about it a lot . I used to dream that one day Paul would come to the door with a bunch of flowers and say that as soon as I was sixteen we would marry . " " But it did n\'t happen ? " " No . " " And why did he not want to stay around and support you even if you did           deal . His parents said that since this was an unlikely partnership and that there was no future in it , it might be kindest for everyone to cut all ties . That \'s what they said . Cut all ties . " " Were they awful ? " " I do n\'t know . I \'d never met them until then , any more than Paul had met Mam and Dad . " " So the deal was that he was to get away with it , father a child , and never see you again . " " They gave four thousand pounds , Kathy . It was a lot of money then . " " They bought you off ! " " No , we did n\'t think it was like that . I put two thousand away for you . It \'s grown a lot , as well as what I added myself . The other two thousand went to Mam and Dad because they would be bringing you up . " " And did Paul Malone think that was fair ? " " He listened           young to be a father , he had a career ahead of him , it was a mistake , he must honor the arrangements that had been made . That \'s the way they saw it . " " And did he have a career ? " " Yes , he \'s an accountant now . And he married and has children , his own family . " " He has other children ? " Kathy \'s eyes widened . " Two , I believe . " " How do you know ? " " There was an article about him in a magazine not long ago-you know , lifestyles of the rich and famous . " " But he \'s not famous . " " His wife is . He married Marianne Hayes . " Fran waited to see the effect this would have . " My father is married to one of the richest women in Ireland ? " " Yes . " " And he gave a measly four thousand pounds to get rid of me . " " That \'s not the point . He was           the point . He \'s rich now , he should give something . " " You have enough , Kathy . We have everything we want . " " No , of course I have n\'t everything I want , and neither do you , " Kathy said , and suddenly the tears that were waiting came , and she cried and cried , while Fran , who she had thought for 16 years was her sister , stroked her head and her wet cheeks with all the love a mother could give . THE NEXT MORNING AT BREAKFAST , JOE Clarke had a hangover . " Will you get me a can of Coke from the fridge , Kathy ? " " You \'re nearer to the fridge than I am , " Kathy said . " Are you giving me cheek ? " he asked . " No , I \'m just stating a fact . " " Well , no child of mine is going to be stating facts in that tone of voice , " he said , his face flushed with anger . " I           coldly . They did n\'t even look up startled , her grandparents , these people she had thought of as her mother and father . The woman went on reading a magazine and smoking ; the man grumbled : " I \'m as good as any other father you ever had or will have . Go on , child , give me the Coke , now , to save me getting up , will you ? " And Kathy realized that they were n\'t in the business of secrecy or pretending . Like Fran , they had assumed she knew the state of affairs . She looked at Fran standing with a rigid back looking out the window . " All right , Dad , " she said , and got him the can of cola and a glass to pour it into . " There \'s a good girl , " he said , smiling at her as he always did . For him , nothing had changed . " WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DISCOVered you were n\'t your parents " " I \'d be delighted ,           " Because then I would n\'t grow up to have an awful chin like mt mother and my grandmother , and I would n\'t have to listen to Daddy droning on about my grades . " Harriet \'s father had great hopes that Harriet would be a doctor . Harriet wanted to own a nightclub . They let the matter drop . " What do know about Marianne Hayes ? " Kathy asked later . " She \'s like the richest woman in Dublin . And she \'s good-looking too . Why are you interested in her ? " " I dreamt about her last night , " Kathy said truthfully . " Well , you look awful pale and tired , so do n\'t dream about her again . It \'s not doing you any good . " " No , it \'s not , " Kathy agreed , thinking suddenly of Fran with her white face and the lines under her eyes . She thought of Fran saving money every week for her for 16 years . She remembered Fran \'s boyfriend Ken going off to America .           Someone who was n\'t a plumber \'s daughter who had dragged herself up to the top in a supermarket , someone who was n\'t struggling to support an illegitimate child ? Ken had known about her . It did n\'t appear that Fran had gone to any trouble to keep it a secret . As Fran had said last night , there were many households all over Dublin where the youngest child was really a grandchild . And she had said that in many cases the child \'s mother had not stayed at home ; the eldest sister had left to start a new life . It was n\'t fair . It just was n\'t fair that Paul Malone should have had his pleasure and no responsibility . Three times that day , she was reprimanded in class for not paying attention . But Kathy Clarke had no interest in her studies . She was planning how she should best visit Paul Malone . " TALK TO ME , " FRAN SAID THAT EVENING . " What about ? You said there was nothing more to say . " "           eyes were anxious . She did n\'t have expensive creams to take away the lines on her face . She never had anyone to help her bring up a child . Marianne Hayes , now Marianne Malone , must have nurses , nannies , au pairs , chauffeaurs , tennis coaches . Kathy looked at her mother with a level glance . Even though her world had turned upside down , she would n\'t add to Fran \'s trouble . " No , Fran , " she lied . " Nothing \'s changed . " IT WAS N\'T HARD TO FIND OUT WHERE Paul and Marianne lived . There was something about them in a paper almost every week . Everyone knew of their house . But she did n\'t want to go and see him at home . She must go to his office , talk to him in a businesslike way . There was no need to involve his wife in what she wanted to say . She began to telephone large accounting firms . On the second call , she \'d found him . She had heard           and theater people . Not only did he have all the money , he had all the fun too . Twice she went to his office , twice her courage failed her . The building was enormous . Once in , she could talk to him , tell him who she was , how her mother had worked and saved . She would beg for nothing . She would point out the injustice , that was all . But the place was too impressive . It overawed her , with the doorman in the lobby , and the girls at the information desk who called up to see if you were allowed access to the offices above . She would need to look different to get past these groomed dragons at the desk if she were to meet Paul Malone . They would n\'t let a schoolgirl up to see a senior accountant , particularly one married to a millionaire . She telephoned Harriet . " Can you bring some posh clothes of your mother \'s to school tomorrow ? " she asked . " Only if you tell me           adventure . " " A sexual adventure ? " " Possibly . " " Do you want a nightie then ? " Harriet was very practical . " No , a jacket . And gloves . " " This must be something very kinky altogether , " said Harriet . The next day , the clothes arrived slightly crushed in a canvas bag . Kathy tried them on in the girls " cloakroom . The jacket was fine , but the skirt seemed wrong . " Where \'s the adventure ? " Harriet was breathless with excitement . " In an office . " " You could hitch up your school skirt . It would look okay . Will he be undressing you or will you be doing it yourself ? " " What ? Oh , I \'ll be doing it . " " That \'s all right then . " Together they made Kathy look like someone who might gain access anywhere . She had already taken Fran \'s lipstick and eyeshadow . " Do n\'t put it all on now , " Harriet warned . " They           like that . " " I \'m not going to class . You have to say I have the flu . " " But where are you going at nine o\'clock in the morning ? " " To the office to have the adventure , " Kathy said . " You are something else . " Harriet \'s mouth was round in admiration . THIS TIME SHE DID N\'T FALTER . " Good morning . Mr. Paul Malone , please . " " And the name ? " " Please say it is Katherine Clarke , here about the matter of Frances Clarke , a client from a long time ago . " Kathy felt that this was an office where people had full names . " I \'ll speak to his secretary . Mr. Malone does n\'t see anyone without an appointment . " " You may tell her that I will wait until he \'s free . " Kathy spoke with a quiet intensity that was far more effective than her attempt to dress for the part . One of the receptionists seemed to shrug slightly at the           " Miss Clarke , would you care to speak to Mr. Malone \'s secretary ? " she said eventually . " Certainly . " Kathy walked forward , hoping that her skirt would not fall suddenly . " My name is Penny . Can I help you ? " " Have you been given the relevant names ? " Kathy said . How wonderful that she remembered the word relevant . It was a great word , it covered everything . " Well , yes .. but that is not the point . " " I think it is . Please mention the names to Mr. Malone , and please tell him that I will wait here until he can see me . " " We do n\'t make appointments like this . " " Please give him the names . " Kathy felt almost dizzy with excitement . She waited politely for three more minutes , then there was a buzz . " Mr. Malone \'s secretary will meet you on the sixth floor , " said one of the dragons at the desk . " Thank you ,           going into the lift that would take her to meet her father . " Miss Clarke ? " Penny was like someone from a beauty contest . She wore a cream-colored suit and high-heeled black shoes . Around her neck , she wore a thick , black necklace . Kathy wished she was better-looking , older , and better dressed . " Come this way , please . Mr. Malone will see you in the conference room . Coffee ? " " That would be very nice , thank you . " She was shown into a room with a pale wood table and eight chairs around it . There were paintings on the wall and fresh flowers on the windowsill . She sat and waited . In he came , handsome , youngerlooking than Fran . " Hallo , " he said , with a big smile . " Hallo , " she said . There was a silence . Then Penny arrived with the coffee . " Thanks , Pen , " he said . When she \'d left , Kathy said , " Do you know who           . " Were you expecting me ? " " Not for two or three more years , to be honest . " His grin was attractive . " And what would you have done then ? " " What I \'ll do now-listen .... " It was a clever thing to say , he was leaving it all to her . " Well , I just wanted to come and see you , " she said a little uncertainly . " To know what you looked like . " " And now you do . " He was warm and welcoming . " What do you think ? " " You look fine , " she said reluctantly . " And so do you , very fine , " he said . " I only just found out , " she explained . " That \'s why I had to come. ? " I see . " He had poured them coffee and left her to add milk and sugar if she wished . " Until this week , I honestly thought I was Mam and Dad \'s daughter .           " Fran did n\'t tell you that she was your mother ? " " No , she did n\'t . She thought I understood , but I did n\'t . I thought she was just a marvelous older sister . I was n\'t too bright , you see . " " You look fine and bright to me . " He seemed genuinely to admire her . " I \'m not . I \'m a hard worker , but I do n\'t have quick leaps of understanding , not like my friend Harriet . I \'m a plodder . " " So am I as it happens . You take after your father then . " It was an extraordinary moment . He was admitting he was her father . She felt light-headed , with no idea where to go now . She thought he would have blustered , and denied things , and excused himself . " You would n\'t have a job like this if you were just a plodder , " she said . " My wife is very wealthy , and I am a charming plodder           one day , Katherine . You \'ll like her , she \'s a very nice woman . " " It \'s Kathy , and I am sure she is very nice , but she would n\'t want to meet me . " " Yes , if I tell her I would like it . We do things to please each other . " " But she does n\'t know I exist . " " Yes , she does . I told her a long time ago that I had a daughter . " " You did n\'t know my name ? " " No . When all the business happened , Fran said she would just tell me if it was a girl or a boy , that was all . " " That was the deal ? " Kathy said . " You put it very well . That was the deal . " " She thinks you were great in all this . " " And what message does she send me ? " he was very relaxed , gentle . " She has no idea I \'m           ? " " At the Mountainview School . There is n\'t much money out of four thousand pounds sixteen years ago to send me to a posh place , " Kathy said with spirit . " So you know about the deal ? " " I heard about it all at the same time , in one night . I realized she was not my sister and that you had sold me . " " Is that how she put it ? " " No . It \'s how it is . She puts it differently . " " I \'m very sorry . It must have been a bad , bleak thing to hear . " Kathy looked at him . That \'s exactly what it had been : bleak . She had thought about the unfairness of the deal . Her mother was poor , and could be paid off . Her father was the son of privileged people and did n\'t have to pay for his fun . It had made her think the system was always loaded against people like her , and always would be           was . It is . " " Well , tell me what you want now , " he said . " Tell me , and we can talk about it . " She had been going to demand everything under the sun for Fran and for herself . But it was n\'t possible to say this to the man who sat easily across the table , giving every impression of being pleased to see her . " I \'m not sure what I want . It \'s all a bit soon . " " I know . You have n\'t had time to work out how you feel yet . " He did n\'t look like a man who \'d been let off the hook . He sounded sympathetic . " Are n\'t you annoyed I came ? " " No , I \'m delighted you came . I \'m only sorry that life was hard up to now , and then it got worse with this shock . " She felt a lump in her throat . He could n\'t have been more different from what she had imagined           would have been married and she would be their eldest girl . He took out a business card and wrote on it . " This is my direct line and my home number . You can call me anytime . " " What about your wife ? " " Marianne will be happy to speak to you , too , of course . I shall tell her tonight that you came to see me . " " You \'re very cool , are n\'t you ? " Kathy said with a mixture of admiration and resentment . " I \'m calm , I suppose , on the exterior , but inside I \'m very excited . Who would n\'t be ? To meet a handsome , grown-up daughter for the first time and to realize that it was because of me you came into the world . " " And do you ever think of my mother ? " " I thought of her for awhile , as we all think of our first love , and more than that because of what happened and because you had been born           things and other people . " It was the truth ; Kathy could n\'t deny that . " What will I call you ? " she asked suddenly . " You call Fran , Fran . Ca n\'t you call me Paul ? " " I \'ll come and see you again , Paul , " she said , standing up to leave . " Anytime you want me , I \'ll be here Kathy , " said her father . They each put out a hand , but when they touched , he drew her to him and hugged her . " It will be different from now on , Kathy , " he said . " Different and better . " AS SHE RODE BACK TO SCHOOL ON A bus , Kathy rubbed off her lipstick and eyeshadow . She rolled up Harriet \'s mother \'s jacket into the canvas bag and went to rejoin the classes . " Well ? " demanded Harriet . " Nothing happened . " " You mean you took all that gear and went to his office , and he did n\'t           , " Kathy said . " I expect he \'s impotent , " Harriet said sagely . " In the magazines , you always read about that sort of thing . There seems to be a lot of it about . " " It could be , I suppose , " said Kathy , and took out her geography book . The teacher looked at her over his half glasses . " Your flu better all of a sudden , Kathy ? " he asked suspiciously . " Yes , thank God , sir , " Kathy said . She was n\'t rude or defiant , but she spoke to him as an equal not a pupil . That child has come a long way since the beginning of term , he said to himself . He wondered if it had anything to do with the Italian classes , which by some miracle had proved not to be the total disaster he had predicted . MAM HAD GONE TO BINGO . DAD WAS AT the pub . Fran was at home in the kitchen . " You \'re a bit           Sure . I took a walk . I learned all the parts of the body for class tonight . You know Signora is going to put us into pairs and ask , Dov\'e il gomito , and you have to touch your partner \'s elbow . " Fran was pleased to see her happy . " Shall I make us a toasted sandwich to give us energy for all this ? " " Great . Do you know the Italian word for feet ? " " I piedi . I studied at lunchtime . " Fran grinned . " We \'re going to be teacher \'s pets , you and I. " " I went to see him today , " Kathy said . " Who ? " " Paul Malone . " Fran sat down . " You \'re not serious . " " He was very nice . He gave me his card . Look , he gave me his direct line and his home number . " " I do n\'t think it was a wise thing to do , " Fran said eventually . " Well           said he was glad I came . " " He did ? " " Yes . And he said I could come anytime and go to his house and meet his wife if I wanted to . " Fran \'s face seemed empty suddenly , as if the life had gone out of it , as if someone had put a hand into her head and switched something off . Kathy was puzzled . " Well , are n\'t you pleased ? There was no scene . He understood that it had all been a bit of a shock , and he said from now on it would be different . Different and better , those were his words . " Fran nodded and got out the words , " Yes , that \'s good . " " Why are n\'t you glad ? I thought this is what you \'d like . " " You have every right to get in touch with him and to be part of all he has . I never meant to deny you that . " " It is n\'t a question of           . You \'re right to feel shortchanged when you see a man like that who has everything . " " That \'s not what I was looking for- " Kathy began . " And then you come back to a house like this , and go to a school like Mountainview , and you \'re meant to think that going to some evening class that I scrimp and save for is a treat . No wonder you hope things are going to be .. what is it , different and better ? " Kathy looked at her in horror . Fran thought she wanted Paul Malone instead of her . That she had been dazzled by a momentary meeting with a man she had not heard of until a few days ago . " It \'s only better because now I know everything . Nothing else will change , " she tried to explain . " Of course . " Fran was clipped and tight now . She was spreading cheese on the bread , with two slices of tomato each , and putting it under the grill as if           I do n\'t want any of that . Listen . Do n\'t you understand ? I had to see him . You were right , he \'s not a monster , he \'s nice . " " I \'m glad I told you . " " But you \'ve got it wrong . It \'s not that I want to be with him rather than you . It \'s only just to see him the odd time . That \'s all . Why do n\'t you call him , talk to him on the phone , then you \'ll understand . " " No . " " Why not ? " " Sixteen years ago , I made a bargain . The deal was that I would not contact him again , and I never did . " " But I did n\'t make that deal . " " No , and am I criticizing you ? I said you had every right . Is n\'t that what I said ? " Fran served them cheese on toast and poured two glasses of milk . Kathy felt inexpressibly sad ,           making sure that she \'d had everything she needed . There would have been no pints of cold milk at the ready , no hot suppers cooked if it were not for Fran . Now she had even let slip that she had scrimped and saved for the Italian classes . No wonder she was hurt at the thought that Kathy might , after all this sacrifice , be prepared to forget the years of love and commitment , that she would be blinded by the unaccustomed thought of access to real wealth . " We should go now for the bus , " Kathy said . " Sure , if you want to . " " Of course , I want to . " " Right then . " Fran put on a coat that had seen better days . She changed into her good shoes , which were n\'t all that good . Kathy remembered the soft leather shoes that her father wore . She knew that they were very expensive . " Avanti , " she said . And they ran for the bus . AT THE           , menacing frown seemed somehow more sinister than ever tonight . " Dov\'e il cuore ? " Luigi asked . His Dublin accent made it hard to know what he was talking about . " II cuore , " said Luigi again , annoyed . Fran looked at him vaguely . " Non so , " she said . " Of course you know where your bloody cuore is . " Luigi was getting more unpleasant by the moment . Signora stepped in to make peace . She lifted Fran \'s hand and put it on her heart . " Ecco il cuore . " " It took you long enough to find it , " Luigi grumbled . Signora looked at Fran . She was quite different tonight . Normally she was part of everything and encouraging Kathy to participate as well . Signora had checked with Peggy Sullivan . " Did n\'t you tell me that Miss Clarke was the mother of the sixteenyear-old girl ? " she asked . " Yes , she had her when she was only that age herself . Her mam brought the           , it \'s well-known . " Signora realized that it had not been known to Kathy . But they were both different this week . Perhaps it was known now . Guiltily , she hoped she had played no part in it . KATHY WAITED A WEEK BEFORE SHE called Paul Malone on his direct line . " Is this a good time to talk ? " she asked . " I have someone with me at the moment , but I do want to speak , so please hold a moment . " She heard him getting rid of someone , an important person maybe , a wellknown personality , for all she knew . " Kathy ? " His voice was warm and welcoming . " Did you mean it that we could meet somewhere sometime , not rushed like in the office ? " " Of course , I meant it . Will you have lunch with me ? " " Thank you , when ? " " Tomorrow . Do you know Quentin \'s ? " " I know where it is . " " Great           ? " " I \'ll make it fit in with school . " She was grinning , and she felt him smile too . " Sure , but I do n\'t want you getting into trouble . " " No , I \'ll be fine . " " I \'m glad you rang , " he said . THE NEXT MORNING , SHE WASHED HER hair and dressed with care in her best school blouse . " You \'re meeting him today , " Fran said as she watched Kathy polish her shoes . " I \'ve always said you should have been in Interpol , " Kathy said . " No , you \'ve never said that . " " It \'s just for lunch . " " I told you , it \'s your right if you want to . Where are you going ? " " Quentin \'s . " She had to tell the truth . Fran would have to know sooner or later . She wished he had n\'t picked somewhere quite as posh . Fran managed to find the words of encouragement . "           All of it . " KATHY REALIZED HOW LITTLE PART IN their lives Mam and Dad seemed to play these days ; they were just there in the background . Had it always been like that and she just had n\'t noticed ? She gave the excuse at school that she had a dentist \'s appointment and no one questioned her . It had paid off to have been a hardworking pupil all those years . She was not one of the school troublemakers . She could get away with anything now . Naturally , she told Harriet that she was skipping classes . " Where are you going this time ? " " To lunch at Quentin \'s , " Kathy said proudly . Harriet \'s jaw fell open . " You are joking ? " " Not a bit . I \'ll bring you back the menu this afternoon . " " You have the most exciting life of anyone I ever met , " Harriet said in envy . THE RESTAURANT WAS DARK , COOL , AND elegant . A good-looking woman in a dark suit came           \'m Brenda Brennan . Are you meeting somebody ? " Kathy wished she could be like this , she wished Fran could-confident and assured . Maybe it was something you had to be born to . Still , you could pretend to be confident . " I \'m meeting Mr. Paul Malone . " " Let me show you to Mr. Malone \'s table . A drink while you \'re waiting ? " Kathy ordered a diet Coke . It came in a crystal glass with ice and slices of lemon . She must remember every moment of it for Harriet . He came in , nodding to people at this table , smiling at that . A man stood to shake his hand . By the time he got to her , he had greeted half the place . " You look different , lovely , " he said . " Well , I \'m not wearing my friend \'s mother \'s jacket and a ton of makeup to get past reception . " She laughed . " Should we order quickly ? Do you have to rush back           , it can take ages . Do you have to rush back ? " " No , not at all . " They got the menus , and Brenda Brennan came to explain the dishes of the day . " We have a nice insalata di mare , " she began . " Gamberi , calamari ? " Kathy asked before she could stop herself . Only last night , in class , they had been covering all the seafood . Gamberi : prawns ; calamari : squid . Both Paul and Brenda Brennan looked at her in surprise-and admiration ... or maybe she was just getting bigheaded . Paul had his usual , which was a glass of wine mixed with mineral water . " You did n\'t have to bring me somewhere as smart as this , " she said . " I \'m proud of you . I wanted to show you off . " " Well , it \'s just that Fran thinks ... I suppose she \'s jealous that I can go somewhere like this with you . " " She \'d understand . I           " " She says it \'s my right , and she said I was to enjoy it all , but I think in her heart she \'s upset . " " Does she have anyone else ? " he asked . Kathy looked up in surprise . " What I \'m trying to say .. . it \'s none of my business , but I hope she has . I \'d hoped she would have married and given you sisters and brothers . But if you do n\'t want to tell me , then do n\'t , because as I say , I do n\'t have any right to ask . " " There was Ken . " " And was it serious ? " " I do n\'t know . But they went out a lot , and she used to laugh when he came to the house to collect her . " " And where is he now ? " " He went to America , " Kathy said . " Was she sorry , do you think ? " " I do n\'t know . He writes           " " Could she have gone ? " " It \'s funny you should say that ... she asked me once if I \'d like to live in a small town in America . And I said no , give me Dublin any day , at least it \'s a capital city . " " Do you think she did n\'t go with Ken because of you ? " " Perhaps that could have had something to do with it . " She looked troubled now , and guilty . " Stop worrying about it . If it \'s anyone \'s fault , it \'s mine . " He had read her thoughts . " I asked her to ring you , but she wo n\'t . " " Did she give a reason ? " " She said because of the deal . " " She was always straight as a die , " he said . " So it looks as if you two will never talk . " " We \'ll never walk into the sunset together , that \'s for sure , because we \'re both           may love Ken . But we will talk . I \'ll see to that . Now , you and I are going to have lunch , as well as solve the problems of the world . " They talked of school , show business , the marvelous Italian classes , and his two children , who were 6 and 7 . As he paid the bill , the woman at the register looked at Kathy with interest . " Excuse me , but is that a Mountainview blazer you \'re wearing ? " Kathy looked guilty . " I recognize it because my husband teaches there , " the woman continued . " Aidan Dunne . " " Oh , Mr. Dunne \'s very nice . He teaches Latin , and he set up the Italian classes , " she told Paul . " And your name ? " the woman asked . " Will be forever a mystery . Girls who take time off for lunch do n\'t want tales brought back to their teachers . " Paul Malone \'s smile was charming , but his voice was steely           too much interest . She just hoped that Ms. Brennan had n\'t overheard . " DO N\'T TELL ME ABOUT IT . " HARRIET yawned . " You had oysters and caviar . " " No . I had lamb . Mr. Dunne \'s wife was at the cash register , and she recognized my blazer . " " Now you \'re done for , " said Harriet with a smirk . " No . I did n\'t tell her who I was . " " She \'ll know . You \'ll be caught . " " Stop saying that . You do n\'t want me to be caught . You want me to go on having these adventures . " " Kathy Clarke , if I had been burned at the stake , I \'d have said you were the last person on earth to have adventures . " " That \'s the way it goes , " said Kathy cheerfully . " PERSONAL CALL FOR MISS CLARKE ON line three , " announced the loudspeaker . Fran looked up in surprise . She moved into the surveillance room           seen . She pressed the button for line three . " Miss Clarke . " " Paul Malone , " said the voice . She became very still . " Yes ? " " I \'d love to talk . I do n\'t suppose you \'d like to meet ? " " You \'re right , Paul . No bitterness , just no point . " " It \'s about Kathy . She \'s hugely important to me , but ... " " But you do n\'t want to get too involved , " Fran finished for him . " Absolutely wrong . I would love to get as involved as I can , but you brought her up , you made her what she is , you are the person who cares for her most in the world . I do n\'t want to muscle in suddenly . I want you to tell me what would be best for her . " " Do you think I know ? How could I ? I want everything in the world for her , but I ca n\'t get it .           give it to her . " " She thinks the world of you , Fran . " " She \'s pretty taken with you too . " " She \'s only known me a week . She \'s known you all her life . " " Do n\'t break her heart , Paul . She \'s a great girl , and she \'s had a shock . I thought she knew , guessed , absorbed it or something . It \'s not such an unusual situation around here . " " No , but she \'s coped with it . She \'s got your genes . " " Yours , too , and lots of courage . " " So what will we do , Fran ? " " We have to leave it to her . " " She can have as much of me as she wants , but I promise you , I wo n\'t try to take her away from you . " " I know . " There was a silence . " And are things ... well , all right ? " he asked           " She tells me you \'re both learning Italian . She spoke Italian in the restaurant today . " " Good for her . " Fran sounded pleased . " Did n\'t we do well in a way , Fran ? " " We sure did , " she said , and hung up before she burst into tears . " WHAT ARE CARCIOFI , SIGNORA ? " Kathy asked in a private moment at the end of the class . " Artichokes , Caterina . Why do you ask ? " " I went to a restaurant and they had them on the menu . Oh , by the way , Signora , you know how you thought Fran was my mother , but I said she was my sister ? " " Yes ... ? " Signora was ready to apologize . " You were right . I had n\'t understood . But now I do . " " Well , it \'s good to have it all sorted out . " " I think it is good , " Kathy said . " It must be .           and nice , and you \'ll have her around for years , much longer than if she were an older mother . " " Yes , but I wish she \'d get married . Then I would n\'t feel so responsible for her . " " She may in time . " " But I think she missed her chance . He went to America . I think she stayed because of me . " " You could write to him , " said Signora . " PAUL ? " " Kathy , it \'s been ages . " Will you have lunch with me , my treat ? Not Quentin \'s . " " Sure , where do you suggest ? " " I won a prize in my Italian class , a voucher for lunch for two , including wine , at a little Italian restaurant . " " I ca n\'t have you missing any more school . " " Well , I was going to suggest Saturday , unless that \'s a problem . " " It \'s never a problem , I told you that           over all her other classmates . Paul said he was very pleased to have been chosen as her guest . " I want to put something to you , " she said . " It \'s got to do with money , but it \'s not begging . " " Put it to me , " he said . She told him about the flight to New York for Christmas . Ken could pay for most of it , but he did n\'t have it all , and he could n\'t borrow from anyone in America . " Tell me about it , " said Paul Malone , the accountant . " I wrote to Ken and told him that I knew about everything now , and I was sorry if I had stood in his way with Fran . He was so pleased . He wrote back and said that he loved Fran , and he had been thinking of coming back to Ireland for her , but he felt he would mess things up all ways if he did that . Honestly , Paul , I ca n\'t           but you \'d love it , you really would , you \'d be pleased for Fran . " " I know I would . " " So , I \'ll tell you exactly how much it is . Three hundred pounds . know that \'s enormous . But I know that much and more is in an account Fran has for me . So , you see , it \'s only a loan . When we get them together , I \'ll ask her for the money , and then I can give it straight back to you . " " I \'d give you anything , Kathy , and your mother , too , but you ca n\'t take away people \'s pride . How would we give it so that it does n\'t look the way it is ? " " Could n\'t we just send it to Ken ? " " I think that would be taking away his pride . " There was a silence . The waiter came to ask if they were enjoying the meal . " Benissimo , " Kathy said . "           a voucher she won in her Italian class , " Paul said . " You must be clever , " said the waiter . " No , I \'m just good at winning things , " Kathy said . Paul looked as if an idea had just struck him . " That \'s it ! You could win a couple of air tickets , " he suggested . " How could I do that ? " " Well , you won two lunches here . " " That \'s because Signora organized the contest in class . " " Well , maybe I could organize it that someone could win a round-trip air ticket . " " And should we tell Ken ? " " I do n\'t think so , " said Paul . " What do you think ? " " ! do n\'t think he has any need to know the whole scenario , " Kathy said . It was a phrase Harriet used a lot . And this is the perfect occasion for it , she thought happily . It was true , what Paul had           would go on being that way-for her and for Fran .

She began writing novels in the mid-1970 \'s . Currently , there are more than six million copies of her books in print .', 'A man walked by humming a little tune . " Excuse me , sir , but I ca n\'t get into my car , my son is late for his oboe lesson , and our ice cream is melting .           " said the man . He hummed while he tried the door on the driver \'s side . He hummed while he tried the door on the other side . He hummed while he tried the back door . Finally he stopped humming and peered through the car window . " Something \'s wrong , " said the man . " Very wrong , " said the woman with the French poodle . " Oh my , " said Mrs. Doosilly . " What can I do now ? " " But , Mom- " said Willy . " Quiet , Willy , " said Mrs. Doosilly . " Something must be done ! " Mrs. Doosilly stopped a Girl Scout troop as they were walking by , a soccer team on their way to a game , a clown on his way to the circus , a marching band on its way to a parade , and a kindergarten class on their way to the zoo . No one could help . They all waited to see what Mrs. Doosilly would do . " I guess I \'ll have           . She took a can of peas out of the bag . Then she wound up her arm as if she were a baseball pitcher . " NO , MOM , WAIT ! " shouted Willy . Everyone turned to look at him . " Oh , Willy , what is it ? " " That \'s our car over there ! " said Willy . And so it was . Mrs. Doosilly thanked everyone for their-help . Then she and Willy drove home . It was too late for Willy \'s oboe lesson , so they drank mint chocolate chip soup instead .', '" Fine . " John kicked the snow off his shoes , and sorted through the mail on the hall table . A large booklet dominated the bundle , with a large " 1040 " on the stiff cover page .

Not until April sixteenth , anyway . "', 'Miss Willerton always crumbed the table , It was her particular household accomplishment and she did it with great thoroughness . Lucia and Bertha did the dishes and Garner went into the parlor and did the Morning Press crossword puzzle . That left Miss Wilerton in the dining room all by herself and that was all right with Miss Willerton . Whew ! Breakfast in that house was always an ordeal . Lucia insisted that they have a regular hour for breakfast just like they did for the other meals . Lucia said a regular breakfast made for other regular habits , and with Garner \'s tendency to upsets , it was imperative that they established some system in their eating . This way she could also see that he put the AgarAgar on his Cream of Wheat . As if , Miss Willerton thought , after having done it for fifty years , he \'d be capable of doing anything else . The breakfast dispute always started with Garner \'s Cream of Wheat and ended           know your acid , Willie , " Miss Lucia would always say , " you know your acid " ; and then Garner would roll his eyes and make some sickening remark and Bertha would jump and Lucia would look distressed and Miss Willerton would taste the pineapple crush she had already swallowed . It was a relief to crumb the table . Crumbing the table gave one time to think , and if Miss Willerton were going to write a story , she had to think about it first . She could usually think best sitting in front of her typewriter , but this would do for the time being . First , she had to think of a subject to write a story about . There were so many subjects to write stories about that Miss Willerton never could think of one . That was always the hardest part of writing a story , she always said . She spent more time thinking of something to write about than she did writing . Sometimes she discarded subject after subject and it usually took her a week or two           the silver crumber and the crumb-catcher and started stroking the table . I wonder , she mused , if a baker would make a good subject ? Foreign bakers were very picturesque , she thought . Aunt Myrtile Filmer had left her four colortints of French bakers in mushroom-looking hats . They were great tall fellows-blond and ... " Willie ! " Miss Lucia screamed , entering the dining room with the saltcellars . " For heaven \'s sake , hold the catcher under the crumber or you \'ll have those crumbs on the rug . I \'ve Bisseled it four times in the last week and I am not going to do it again " " You have not Bisseled it on account of any crumbs I have spilled , " Miss Willerton said tersely . " I always pick up the crumbs I drop , " and she added , " I drop relatively few " " And wash the crumber before you put it up this time " Miss Lucia returned . Miss lllerton drained the crumbs into her hand and threw them out the window .           ran them under the cold-water faucet . She dried them and stuck them back in the drawer . That was over . Now she could get to the typewriter . She could stay there until dinnertime .', 'Miss Willerton settled back . That was a good beginning . Now she would plan her action . There had to be a woman , of course . Perhaps Lot could kill her . That type of woman always started trouble . She might even goad him on to kill her because of her wantonness and then he would be pursued by his conscience maybe . He would have to have principles if that were going to be the case , but it would be fairly easy to give him those . Now how was she going to work that in with all the love interest there \'d have to be , she wondered . There would have to be some quite violent , naturalistic scenes , the sadistic sort of thing one read of in connection with that class . It was a problem . However , Miss Wlllerton enjoyed such problems .           but when she came to write them , she always began to feel peculiar and to wonder what the family would say when they read them . Garner would snap his fingers and wink at her every opportunity ; Bertha would think she was terrible ; and Lucia would say in that silly voice of hers , " What have you been keeping from us , Willie ? What have you been keeping from us ? " and titter like she always did . But Miss Willerton could n\'t think about that now ; she had to plan her characters . Lot would be tall , stooped , and shaggy but with sad eyes that made him look like a gentleman in spite of his red neck and big fumbling hands . He \'d have straight teeth and , to indicate that he had some spirit , red hair . His clothes would hang on him but he \'d wear them nonchalantly like they were part of his skin ; maybe , she mused , he \'d better not roll over with the dog after all . The woman would           muddy-colored eyes . She would get supper for him in the cabin and he \'d sit there eating the lumpy grits she had n\'t bothered to put salt in and thinking about something big , something way off-another cow , a painted house , a dean well , a farm of his own even . The woman would yowl at him for not cutting enough wood for her stove and would whine about the pain in her back . She \'d sit and stare at him eating the sour grits and say he did n\'t have nerve enough to steal food . " You \'re just a damn beggar ! " she \'d sneer . Then he \'d tell her to keep quiet . " Shut your mouth ! " he \'d shout . " I \'ve taken all I \'m gon na " She \'d roll her eyes , mocking him , and laugh " I ai n\'t afraid er nothin " that looks like you " Then he \'d push his chair behind him and head toward her . She \'d snatch a knife off the table-Miss Willerton           away holding it in front of her . He \'d lunge forward but she \'d dart from him like a wild horse . Then they \'d face each other again-their eyes brimming with hate-and sway back and forth . Miss Willerton could hear the seconds dropping on the tin roof outside . He \'d dart at her again but she \'d have the knife ready and would plunge it into him in an instant-Miss Willerton could stand it no longer . She struck the woman a terrific blow on the head from behind . The knife dropped out of her hands and a mist swept her from the room . Miss Willerton turned to Lot . " Let me get you some hot grits , " she said . She went over to the stove and got a dean plate of smooth white grits and a piece of butter . " Gee , thanks , " Lot said and smiled at her with his nice teeth . " you always fix " em just right . You know , he said , I been thinkin \' -we could get out           place . If we made an ) 4fng this year over , we could put it in a cow an " start buildin " things up . Think what it would mean , Willie , just think " She sat down beside him and put her hand on his shoulder . " We \'ll do it " she said . " We \'ll make better than we \'ve made any year and by spring we should have us that cow " " You always know how I feel , Willie , " he said . " You always have known " They sat there for a long time thinking of how well they understood each other . " Finish your food ; " she said finally After he had eaten , he helped her take the ashes out the stove and then , in the hot July evening , they walked down the pasture toward the creek and talked about the place they were going to have some day . When late March came and the rainy season was almost there , they had accomplished almost more than was believable           every morning at five , and Willie an hour earlier to get in all the work they could while the weather was clear . Next week , Lot said , the rain would probably start and if they did n\'t get the crop in by then , they would lose it-and all they had gained in the past months . They knew what that meantanother year of getting along with no more than they \'d had the last . Then too , there \'d be a baby next year instead of a cow . Lot had wanted the cow anyway . " Children do n\'t cost all that much to feed , " he \'d argued , " an " the cow would help feed him ; " but Willie had been firm-the cow could come laterthe child must have a good start . " Maybe " Lot had said finally , " we \'ll have enough for both , " and he had gone out to look at the new-plowed ground as if he could count the harvest from the furrows . Even with as little as they \'d           had cleaned the shack , and Lot had fixed the chimney . There was a profusion of petunias by the doorstep and a colony of snapdragons under the window . It had been a peaceful year . But now they were becoming anxious over the crop . They must gather it before the rain . " We need another week , " Lot muttered when he came in that night . " One more week an " we can do it . Do you feel like gatherin \' ? It is n\'t right that you should have to , " he sighed , " but I ca n\'t hire any help " " I \'m all right . " she said , hiding her trembling hands behind her . " rll gather " it \'s cloudy tonight , " Lot said darkly . The next night they worked until nightfall-worked until they could work no longer and then stumbled back to the cabin and fell into bed . Willie woke in the night conscious of a pain . It was a soft , green pain with purple lights running through           head rolled from side to side and there were droning shapes grinding boulders in it . Lot sat up . " Are you bad off ? " he asked , trembling . She raised herself on her elbow and then sank down again . " Get Anna , up by the creek " she gasped . The droning became louder and the shapes grayer . The pain intermingled with them for seconds first , then interminably . It came again and again . The sound of the droning grew more distinct and toward morning she realized that it was rain . Later she asked hoarsely , " How long has it been raining ? " " Most two days now , " Lot answered . " Then we lost : " Willie looked listlessly out at the dripping trees . " It \'s over " " It is n\'t over , " he said softly . " We got a daughter " " You wanted a son " " No , I got what I wanted-two Willies instead of one-that \'s better than a cow , even , " he           I got , Willie ? " He bent over and kissed her forehead . " What can I ? " she asked slowly " And what can I do to help you more ? " " How about your going to the grocery , Willie ? " Miss Willerton shoved Lot away from her . " W-what did you say , Lucia ? she stuttered . " I said how about your going to the grocery this time ? Pve been every morning this week and I \'m busy now " Miss Willerton pushed back from the typewriter . *Very well , " she said sharply . " What do you want there ? " aA dozen eggs and two pounds of tomatoes-ripe tomatoes-and you \'d better start doctoring that cold right now . Your eyes are already watering and you \'re hoarse . There \'s Empirin in the bathroom . Write a check on the house for the groceries . And wear your coat . It \'s cold " Miss Willerton rolled her eyes upward . " I am forty-four years old ; " she announced , " and           tomatoes , " Miss Lucia returned . Miss Willerton , her coat buttoned unevenly , tramped up Broad Street and into the supermarket . " What was it now ? " she muttered . " Two dozen eggs and a pound of tomatoes , yes " She passed the lines of canned vegetables and the crackers and headed for the box where the eggs were kept . But there were no eggs . " Where are the eggs ? " she asked a boy weighing snap beans . " We ai n\'t got nothin " but pullet eggs , " he said , fishing up another handful of beans . " Well , where are they and what is the difference ? " Miss Willerton demanded . He threw several beans back into the bin , slouched over to the egg box and handed her a carton . " There ai n\'t no difference really ; " he said , pushing his gum over his front teeth . " A teenage chicken or somethin ; I do n\'t know . You want em ? " " Yes , and two           added . She did not like to do the shopping . There was no reason those clerks should be so condescending . That boy would n\'t have dawdled with Lucia . She paid for the eggs and tomatoes and left hurriedly . The place depressed her somehow . Silly that a grocery should depress one-nothing in it but trifling domestic do*ngs-women buying beans-riding children in those grocery go-cartshiggling about an eighth of a pound more or less of squash-what did they get out of it ? Miss Willerton wondered . Where was there any chance for selfexpression , for creation , for art ? All around her it was the same-sidewalks full of people scurrying about with their hands full of little packages and their minds full of little packages-that woman there with the child on the leash , pulling him , jerking him , dragging him away from a window with a jack-o \' -lantern in it ; she would probably be pulling and jerking him the rest of her life . And there was another , dropping a shopping bag all over the street , and another wiping           old woman was coming with three grandchildren jumping all over her , and behind them was a couple walking too close for refinement . Miss Willerton looked at the couple sharply as they came near and passed . The woman was plump with yellow hair and fat ankles and muddycolored eyes . She had on high-heel pumps and blue anklets , a too-short cotton dress , and a plaid jacket . Her skin was mottled and her neck thrust forward as if she were sticking it out to smell something that was always being drawn away . Her face was set in an inane grin . The man was long and wasted and shaggy . His shoulders were stooped and there were yellow knots along the side of his large , red neck . His hands fumbled stupidly with the girl \'s as they slumped along , and once or twice he smiled sickly at her and Miss Willerton could see that he had straight teeth and sad eyes and a rash over his forehead . " Ugh , " she shuddered . Miss Willerton laid the groceries on the           looked at the paper in it . " Lot Motun called his dog , it read . " The dog pricked up its ears and slunk over to him . He pulled the animal \'s short , scraggy ears and rolled over with it in the mud " " That sounds awful ! " Miss Willerton muttered . " It \'s not a good subject anyway , " she decided . She needed something more colorful-more arty . Miss Willerton looked at her typewriter for a long time . Then of a sudden her fist hit the desk in several ecstatic little bounces . " The Irish ! " she squealed . " The Irish ! " Miss Willerton had always admired the Irish . Their brogue , she thought , was full of music ; and their history-splendid ! And the people , she mused , the Irish people ! They were full of spirit-red-haired , with broad shoulders and great , drooping mustaches .

It was a big green monster of a Caddy and it had once been a real prize of a car ( it had in fact been the guy \'s pride and joy ) , but now it was getting old . It leaked oil onto the driveway , and the rings were shot , consequently it used so much oil that he thought he would have to hook up a funnel system through the front seat so that he could empty quarts of 10-30 and STP into the bugger as he drove . Also , the heater leaked onto the carpet and in the cool spring months astonishing mushrooms grew in profusion . The experience of seeing the car go from new and valuable to old and an embarrassment was of course at first a disappointment to the guy           of those guys who get to see , that the disintegration of the caddy provided an interesting lesson for him about investing self-esteem in objects all of which are not only illusory in and of themselves , but prone to , nay , certain to decay . So he actually kept the beast because it was old and decrepit and because it spoke to him , in an unmistakably clear , green voice , about an important wisdom . And it also would still limp to the grocery store once or twice a week , farting blackly the whole way . But , to get on with this story , one day somebody stole his car right out of his driveway ! Seems that the " classics " value of the " 54 Caddy was going through the roof . And even limping as it did and sprouting fungi from its carpet , it was valuable for its near pristine body . ( California cars are famously rust free . ) When the guy \'s neighbor found out what had happened , he ran over ( taking , as he           , a brand-spanking new Chevy Vega , whose presence suddenly seemed to him much more a matter of speculation than it had before this theft ) . He said , " I \'m so sorry to hear about your car . I ca n\'t believe that some young punk " ( he was a great one for blaming things on young punks ) " has stolen your good ol " Caddy . " The guy looked at his neighbor and said , " You know , I ca n\'t tell if this is a good thing or a bad . The car was a piece of junk . I did n\'t dare leave the neighborhood in it . And my homeowner \'s policy , for some crazy reason clear only to insurance guys , is going to give me money for it , the kind of money you would expect to get for something that actually ran . I \'m kind of surprised that the thief was able to convince it to fart its way off of the block . On the other hand , I \'ll miss the things           looked at him in confounded confusion . " Do n\'t you fucking get it ? Some jackass young punk of a kid stole your automobile right off of your own private property . There are principles involved . " Some weeks later , he got a call from the police saying that they \'d found the Caddy in a nearby used car lot and he could get it back . Also , the owner of the lot wanted to talk to him . So the guy took a bus to the lot and went immediately to his Caddy . He stuck his head inside and smelled the sweet decay , and smiled . Yes , he thought , this is my car . It \'s speaking to me . " Born alone , die alone , in between a dream . " That \'s my car all right . He was glad . But he had more to be glad about . The owner of the lot felt bad about being taken in by the forged pink slip that the thief had presented him . So he wanted to make           him a newer car . ( Okay , at first he just wanted to offer the guy a " real good deal " on a very new and expensive car , but the guy was no way interested in any factory discounted stock overload sticker rebated special leasing arrangements . ) It was a used Plymouth Barracuda , sporty as all get out , still pretty fast , and a real plunge back into memories of the guy \'s sportier youth . He thought at first he should n\'t take it . Another possession to worry about . But these sweet memories and the idea that his neighbor would never shut up if he turned down a free car finally convinced him to go ahead with it . Now the guy \'s neighbor was amazed at his good fortune . " I ca n\'t believe this , " he said , " someone robs you and you not only get the thing you lost back , but you get a new thing worth double or more the thing you supposedly lost ! You are such a fucking lucky stiff .           of a lesson here himself , if he knew how to recognize it . But all he could recognize was that the guy \'s Barracuda made his Chevy Vega ( newer though it might be ) look lumpish . His Vega had no sporty wire wheels , for example . And the neighbor guy still had two more years of payments to make on his lumpish vehicle . ( In truth , he \'d gotten essentially mugged money-wise by his dealer who had nothing more difficult to do to make that sale than wipe the neighbor guy \'s drool off his chin . In further truth , with still a year left to pay on it , his Vega would implode after a fan belt broke , the car over-heated , the aluminum block warped , the cylinder walls corrugated , the piston rings wore , and the apocalyptic flatulence of the little Vega made the black farting of the guy \'s Caddy look like an azure day . ) But the guy himself was strangely uneasy , even worried about his good fortune . He wondered if this flashy           before it . He really did n\'t want to have to worry about scratches and dings and shouting at strangers who parked too close to him . And he sure did n\'t see the pleasure in spending his weekends out in the driveway with a bucket of soapy water and a can of polish always worried about something . Was it rusty ? Was it shiny ? Was it shiny enough ? Was that a streak on the right rear panel ? Strange , I know , but this guy was really different . He thought different thoughts than you and I. He was the kind of guy who understood that each mile that popped up on the odometer was a little death . " I \'ll never travel that mile again . This machine is one mile closer to rusting in a junk yard . " ) And this was not morbidity talking to him . The guy actually took some sort of weird comfort in these thoughts . He must have been one helluva guy in his previous life . So , anyway , a few weeks later           possessed little of the guy \'s wisdom-so much for theories that pastlife-wisdom is transferred genetically ) took the car out for a spin . An unauthorized spin with the unauthorized ignition key , the unauthorized buddy and the way unauthorized six pack of Olde English 800 malt liquor . He had a license and all but he was really ill-prepared for pushing a speedy roadster fast on country blacktops-like notorious Redwood Road , where high school boys went to diewhich is exactly where he pointed himself and his buddy , as if they had a sort of destiny . Well , inevitably the guy \'s son crashed the danged car into a tree . He \'d been swilling some beer and failed to notice a curve ( " there were a lot of curves , " he complained , " and I only missed one " ) and went into a big old cedar ( second growth , but fifty-year-old second growth and more than big enough to shiver this kid \'s timber ) . Happily , it was a sort of glancing blow that more diverted than crushed the           although both had numerous broken bones and cuts to their faces which flowed freely and terrified mothers for one hundred miles in every direction . The neighbor , who was by this time starting to wear a path in the lawn with his frequent need to console/congratulate , came over to tell the guy how sorry he was . ( Although , you know how these things go in the human brain , he was n\'t entirely sorry to see how smashed up the guy \'s Barracuda was . ) But the guy said , " I do n\'t know how to feel about it . My son is going to be okay . The car is trashed , and I ca n\'t repair it because I did n\'t have collision coverage on it , but I \'m sort of glad that I do n\'t have to worry any more about how it will affect my life . Plus , if I leave it crippled in the driveway for the next few years it will serve as a constant reminder to my son . He needed the opportunity to learn           news . " The neighbor retreated , muttering , back across the lawn to his own home , walking by his own frighteningly shiny Vega . ( He actually , for the first time , looked at it with some suspicion . ) Two years later , when the guy \'s son was draft age , he received a letter from the draft board telling him that it was time to serve his country . In Viet Nam . So the poor dumb kid went down with hundreds of other poor dumb kids . But the guy \'s poor dumb kid failed the physical because his knees had some resemblance to knees but also to mashed potatoes , all thanks to one Barracuda and one cypress tree . Again , the guy had to look at the situation and say , " If my son had n\'t driven the Barracuda into a tree , he would be on his way now to Viet Nam . Instead , he can go to college . If he can get into one with a 1.95 GPA . This is a great thing .           laws of irony were set to spinning . The boy went to college where he met hippies and draft card burners and went to concerts at the Fillmore West and took a few consciousness-expanding drugs which , given the constricted consciousness he took them with , could n\'t help but do just that-expand his brain . So he came home with this new , expanded brain and lectured his father on imperialism and the military industrial complex and the CIA and the hypocrisy of the guy \'s generation and on and fucking on . So , once again , the guy was totally unsure about the good/badness of what had happened . He even wondered if he would n\'t rather have had his son shipped off to the Nam . Or killed by the cedar . Or never born ! But the guy was really getting quite wise about this **30;135;TOOLONG stuff . So rather than taking his son by his ponytail and smashing the hell out of him , he decided to build a sunroom on the back of his home . Lovely California sunlight streamed into that room           sunlight . He filled it with house plants ( among them , a very swart bonsai cedar ! ) and one squat chair . The chair was pointed at a little shrine into which he had built the severed front end of the old Caddy . And whenever he \'d think that something good or bad had happened to him , he \'d go into his sun room and sit and look at the grill of the Caddy . Sometimes the grill would look like it was the angry growling mouth of some predatory animal . At other times it looked like a very toothy and vaudevillian grin . Sometimes it was both at the same time . Because of this , the guy frequently found himself laughing . Which was fine and hurt no one except that the guy \'s neighbor could hear him laughing and see him sitting in his weird little sunroom laughing , and he did n\'t know what it was about , but he wondered if the guy might be laughing about him . And it started to drive him crazy . He fantasized about           window of his freaky room ( which would have been the ultimate test for the guy \'s philosophy ) . And he damned near did . He was getting that bugged about it . But he did n\'t . Instead , he packed up his shiny Vega in which slept a smoggy future , sold his house and bought a nice not-yet-dented vinyl place out in the new subdivisions in Walnut Creek there to reside with thousands of others who , when their Chevy Vegas selfdestructed and farted blackly , would curse the car , its maker and their personal fates as very bad things indeed . When the guy heard his neighbor was moving , he did n\'t know if it was a good or bad thing . After all ....

You \'re not one of those           take your meaning . " Where you gon na take it ? I \'ll let it pass , but it \'s fortunate for you that I \'m an understandin " fella . Cuz if it were my man Hal there , why , he \'s just the sort of fuck head make a boy like you sorry . Q-I am sorry . . . MJ-Oh hell I do n\'t wan na hear about how sorry you are . Forget it . Here , you want some of this before we get started ? Q-No thanks . I do n\'t drink coffee after a certain hour . MJ-Coffee ! Hell , son , this ai n\'t coffee . Everything what \'s in a thermos ai n\'t coffee . Hell no . This is Kankakee Rye Whiskey , man . Best sippin " whiskey or gulpin " whiskey or just plain drainkin " whiskey here in Central Illinois . Q-No thanks . I \'ve got my own little flask now . MJ-Well good for you ! I \'m glad to hear it . But after awhile those little flasks just do n\'t           Try puttin " two or three of those in a coat pocket . Not just that they do n\'t hold enough , cuz there \'s always more at the Fountains , but they just do n\'t pour fast enough . A man gets frustrated . I mean I got brussels sprout type fuck heads like Hal here around me all day , so when I need to take a belt I need to take a belt . This whatchacall interview will go a whole lot better if I keep my motor runnin \' . That way , you get the " amplified affect " as opposed to the " sober interactional state " like the Professor says . Q-Okay , can I ask my first question . MJ-Sure , son . Go ahead . Shoot . Q-Well , I guess I \'d like to know what you think about the controversies , both recent and remote , over the therapeutic function of The Elixir and its role in state health care . MJ-That \'s some question , son . Where \'d you learn to ask a question like that ?           it . That must be one of those clever tricks you learned at Downstate . But I think I know what you \'re gettin " at . You want to know how we maintain our reputation as Central Illinois " best state supported rehab/ detox facility ? That \'s what the rest of them pussies from the newspapers want to know too . Well , I \'ll tell you . I never told no one else before , but I \'ll tell you . I do n\'t want no one else to hear , so bend on over this way a little . . . IT \'S BECAUSE THOSE STATE SOCIAL SERVICE GIRLS ARE A BUNCH OF WEAK SISTER BRUSSELS SPROUT NECK FUCK HEAD PUSSIES .... And that \'s the reason why . Q-I see . MJ-Sure ! It \'s because the State of Illinois is afraid of us is what it is . Sure , they got questions about our methods . Everyone does . We \'re famous ! But they know that if they pulled their funding , which I have more than politely asked them to do           they could n\'t touch us . We have no shortage of our own resources , man . " Funding " us gives them a little bit of contact with us , if not influence . Sure as hell ai n\'t control . So now what we do , they give us money and we take the check up to Chicago and buy something big , an abandoned building or something that size , take it out to the field by the train depot and torch it . Some anthropo , anthropo-somethin " guy said this big fire made out of a gift had primitive resonance . Coffee clutch or , . . . Hal ? what that brussels sprout neck anthropo-somethin " guy call our big fires ? You do n\'t recall ? Was n\'t coffee clutch , was it ? Yeah , it was ? What I thought . But shit that do n\'t make no sense . Why \'d a guy call a big ass fire a coffee clutch beats the hell out of me . Anyway , that \'s what we do with the State \'s pocket           got 8,520 some residents out here , all of " em good white people with money in their savings accounts and willing to spend it for the privilege of a prolonged stay here , and we got six buildings and underground facilities . We pay zero taxes , have zero unemployment , zero employment and no crime . We have annexed communities around us and attract more industry and satellite corporate endeavors than all but the top ten states in the union . Our bond ratings are AAA+ . Moody accountants pule at my damn boots . You know that Mitsubishi wood chip factory over Coal City way ? That \'s our tax base , and boy do they pay it . Seems no one else wanted the publicity . But shit , they were gon na grind up all those Amazon logs somewhere . Right ? We got every high-tech piece of bric-a-brac you can stack . Con Ed runs a nuclear reactor just for us . We even have a fuckin " radar if you can believe that . Not even I know what the hell it does           spinnin " round top one of the slag heaps . Recovery is like a natural resource for us . We own , I mean own , half the state legislature , and they are not cheap . We have a long ass waiting list to get in here . I have personally refused former United States presidents simply because I did n\'t think they \'d fit in and , to be quite frank with you , I do n\'t like their type . But the bottom line is , our clinicians have nailed their pansy asses to the hardwood on this one . We have showed in studies what the Laboratory of Alcohol Research boys in Tuscola are still peein " their pants about : alcohol do n\'t hurt nothin \' ! It helps families , man . It is part of the Ritual of Family Life and has been for some time . Without alcohol , I do n\'t expect you could even recognize an American family . It is now a hallowed tradition . It helps grease decision making . Danged if it do n\'t . It provides           but no one says it " cept a few brave souls like the Reverend Boyle . Ask him , he \'ll tell you the truth . He knows all the facts . Hal , run get some of the Reverend \'s facts for the boy . Facts aside , I can quote you chapter and verse . Take the case of Joe and Sally . Sally was a computer analyst , and Joe he just drank a whole lot . Now they had a very stable marital relationship for over fifteen years until someone made the mistake of suggesting that Joe \'s drinking was some kind of problem . I do n\'t remember just how they put it . So Joe cleaned up and he and Sally went into therapy . Fuckin " disaster ! Joe was depressed all the time now . He \'d look at ol " Sally sittin " opposite him and say , " Man alive , she \'s fat as sin . I am married to a fat woman . She is no foolin " a real haystack . " Which I think even a           damned good . Then , of course , she \'d go into the old " tearful affect . " Man , a fat woman , with them big red cheeks like someone rubbed them with sandpaper , who does the old " tearful affect " is way worse than ugly . That \'s the sort of thing that can put you off your feed . She gives ugly a bad name . Anyway , so Joe he \'s sittin " there sayin " nuthin " to nobody for weeks on end thinkin " with way more clarity than he likes , " So this is my life . Nothin " pretty about this , " and old Sally just sits there like this blubber-monster of boo-hoo . I ask you , where is this cure at ? You call this " better " than something else ? Anyhow , we finally got old Joe and Sally up here at The Elixir and first thing we do , we put " em in group . And I mean this group was the group to beat all groups . We musta had           people with active substance problems in one big room . When that happens we call it Wormstock . One big nation under the Worm . And nearly as peaceful . Could n\'t have been more than two or three fist fights on the periphery . Everybody \'d heard about this big fat composition of a computer woman who goes boo-hoo and her skinny " salesman " drunk of a husband . Just the thought was pornographic . So you know we sit " em down , get three or four folding chairs propped around old Sally and first thing I say is , " Joe , you know , why do n\'t you have a little taste before we get started ? " And he looks at me wide-eyed , as if I were trying to trick him . So I say , " Joe , lookit , we \'re gon na get you where you wan na go . But we got irregular means . We \'re not like all the rest . We \'re what they call unusual . " And so he says , " Well ,           say , " We got Kankakee Rye is what we got . " So I hand him this very thermos right here and he pours himself a nice transfusion . Well , was n\'t long before old Joe jumps up out of his so-called depression . A mean deprivation of basic human rights is more like what it was . A man has got to be allowed the requisite tools to face the damned day . Now he \'s assertive , angry and demanding and now he wants to know why it is that old Sally never wants to have sex with him . Well now , do n\'t you see ? , we \'ve got these difficulties in the open . Joe \'s got more stuff to get in the open . He \'s got baggage . He \'s got issues like everybody else . Because of old Sally , he \'s sure got the " when women get old they get ugly " issue or a very chubby version thereof . Some people do n\'t like that issue and do n\'t think of it so much as an           , open your damned eyes ! And Joe \'s goin " on about how fat his little buttery squab of a wife has become and why the heck do n\'t she get a Nordic track or something to take the edge off this meat mountain . Sally , she says that she has a complaint , too . She says unless old Joe \'s drunk he has no sexual interests at all and in fact drunk or sober has had no nodding acquaintance with an erection in , lo , these last seven or eight years . Then comes the old tearful affect again . Oh boy ! Group is dyin " out there . They \'re breakin " up . Fallin " out . Makin " like a bunch of whoopin " cranes on a funny drug . So this is the famous butterball of boo-hoo . But then , old Joe \'s little sneaky fingers are stroking the inside of her dimpled thigh . And he do n\'t seem to know where to stop . We lost sight of his hand . But she do n\'t seem to           my opinion , her leg o " lamb was just too damned thick for nerve endings . I mean , you get this fat just goin " on and on , deep like some peat bog , and the nerve endings I believe get lost and confused . So while she \'s goin " boo-hoo , he \'s just gropin " away , heedless . Meanwhile , group is lovin " this stuff . Wormstock . Fat women having sex , drunks with nothin " hard about " em , and everything bathed in boo-hoo . I \'ll tell it like it is : while Joe and Sally were residents here , this place was alive . Nothin " that interesting come this way again till a certain college boy from Downstate who shall go nameless . But my point is , do n\'t you see , that Joe and Sally were better able to demonstrate a wide range of behaviors , more capable and comfortable engaging each other , more attentive to each other \'s feelings when we added a little Kankakee Rye to the equation . With alcohol           . And Sally , feeling disgusted and degraded by his dirty drunken pawing , was able to deflect her guilt at being the portly cause of her husband \'s impotence . What Sally and Joe achieved with our assistance was a clearer understanding of the emotional economy central to their relationship . Sobriety ! Do n\'t make me laugh ! It \'s just not good for everyone . You got to learn to work alcohol . It \'ll work if you let it . Hunnert percent promise . Last I heard , Sally was still being mistaken for landscaping and Joe was still catching furniture on fire in his zealous housekeeping , and they are still married . Some people like to talk about " let \'s get real . " Okay , let \'s get real . Nobody \'s gon na strap Sally to a machine and jiggle off three hundred pounds . And no one \'s gon na get Joe \'s dingle to do more than flap in the wind . The Worm has its own path . It \'s a shiny one .

A mother and father , a seven-year-old girl , a five-year-old boy , and a baby , a little boy , thirteen months old . They had been missing since late May , over six weeks , and the mystery had been in the papers for a while . People around town reported having seen them , but no one had taken much notice .           from the hundreds that passed through during the summer months . Lake McConoughy was the largest lake in Nebraska , one of the largest man-made lakes in the entire Midwest , and it drew not only locals but also vacationers from Omaha and Denver and even farther . When the police came around with the pictures , people thought they had seen them , but they could n\'t be sure . The investigation was bogged down by our town \'s uncertain memory . It did n\'t occur to anyone to drag the lake , especially since reported sightings continued to come in from as far away as Oklahoma and Canada . Most people believed that they would turn up , and that there would be some rational explanation-despite the claims of the grandmother , who lived in Loveland , Colorado , and who had first reported the family missing . She felt foul play was certainly involved . Why else had n\'t they contacted her ? Why else had the father , her son , not returned as scheduled to the real estate office where he \'d worked for ten           father had a theory . He said that it would eventually come out that the father had embezzled a large sum from that real estate company . Sooner or later , he said , the authorities would catch up with them , they would find them living in a big house under an assumed name in some distant , sunny state . " Or maybe , " said my father , " maybe they \'ll never catch them . " He paused , a little taken with this romantic possibility . " Maybe they \'ll get away with it , " he said . When he heard they \'d been found , he seemed almost bitter that the idea he had repeated and embellished turned out to be so far from the truth . " It just does n\'t make any sense , " he said , and glared darkly down at his hands .', '" It \'s freakish , " I agreed . I sipped my beer . " A real tragedy , " I said . My father shook his head : I had failed to get his point . " Do you know , " he said . " Every one of them was still buckled in . That \'s what Buddy Battling told me , and he was there . The woman was driving , and she was strapped in behind the wheel . It just does n\'t make sense . You know , if the water had been icy cold , it would have been just , Bam ! Hypothermia . But it was n\'t that cold . "', '" No , " I said . He was drunk , I thought . I felt the alcohol moving thickly through my own body , and I could n\'t follow where he was going . I gave him the same one-eyed squint .', 'My parents had been separated for almost three years by that time , though they \'d never officially divorced . They had " parted ways , " as my mother said , some time during my sophomore year in college , I was n\'t even sure when . No one told me . My mother moved out to the cabin , and my father remained at the house in Ogallala .', "Nevertheless , my father was out at the cabin regularly . All their finances were still intertwined , and whenever he got a check for work ( he was a carpenter ) he came out and gave it to her , rather than deposit it himself . It did n't make much sense to me .", '" Damn it , Everett , " I heard my mother say sharply , and I smiled because te phrase was so familiar , and because I knew it would make him blush and grow sullen . His real name was Everett , but everyone called him Shorty-he was five foot five , a compact , wiry little man-and some time in the distant past he \'d come to see this nickname as a kind of badge of respect , and " Everett " as an insult , a sissified embarrassment . Even my mother used it only in anger .', '" Morning , " I said , and my father raised his eyes and nodded . My mother said nothing . She flipped an egg and the grease crackled . " I \'ll tell you something , " she said after a moment , without turning from the frying pan . " If you \'re going to be drinking and carrying on until all hours of the night , you can stay with your father . "', 'But no one said anything more . My           an irritated snap of her wrist , and I saw plainly that their argument had been about me . It was an extension of earlier fights they \'d had , when he \'d taken me to bars before I was of legal age . " Do you want toast ? " my mother said , and I nodded . " Yes , please , " I said humbly . " With butter . "', 'This was her " all-l-do-is-serve-people " tone of voice . And it was true , we sat and she waited on us- " hand and foot , " as she liked to say . On the other hand , if I were to attempt to fry my own egg , she would be right behind me , watching and making critical , disapproving           she would say , " What are you digging for ? "', "I do n't know if I was an adult , really . That spring , for a variety of reasons , I had come close to failing my final semester of college , and , at the last minute , had managed to talk my adviser into helping me           my classes , and , two weeks before graduation , packed up my stuff and drove home . I left on the same weekend that the Morrisons disappeared .", "Everyone was talking about the family who had died . My boss told me that there had been a number of reporters around           It was all a mystery . Had they simply run off the road , and perhaps been knocked unconscious before they hit the water ? Had foul play been involved somehow ? A pale fat man in cut-offs told me that he 'd heard they 'd been drugged , that it had been a mob hit-which , if true , never appeared in the papers .", "Looking at their photograph           that car , under the water . I saw it as a scene in a Bergman film-a kind of dreamy blur around the edges , the water a certain undersea color , like a reflection through green glass . Their bodies would be lifted a bit , floating a few centimeters above the upholstery , bobbing a little with the currents but held fast by the seat belts . Silver minnows would flit past the pale hands that still gripped the steering wheel , and hide in the seaweed of the little girl 's long , drifting hair ; a plastic ball might be floating near the ceiling . Their eyes would be wide , and their mouths slightly open ; their skin would be pale and shimmery as the inside of a clamshell ; but there would be no real expression on their faces . They would just stare , perhaps with faint surprise .", "People who knew where my mother lived would ask about it . I said that she did n't hear anything . I was n't back from school at the time , I said . I would talk about how strange it was . It did n't seem logical ; maybe the police would be able to figure out what happened . I honed small speeches for reporters , or news cameras , but I was never interviewed .", "She really was that type of person . It was n't that she did n't care ; it was simply that it was hard for her to take the initiative in a situation that was n't her business . She would have assumed that someone else had already done what needed to be done .", 'At the time , this weird juxtaposition , her insistence on switching to the mundane , seemed like pure irony . Sometimes I thought that she was so repressed that she was more or less blank on the inside-or , at very best , one-dimensional , her consciousness a space where simple commands were given and executed : " Eat . Sleep . Make food for offspring . Sleep again . " Perhaps an occasional emotion or idea would flutter through , briefly , and then disintegrate . If anyone could fail to be curious about this horrific event , it was my mother .', "Looking back , I realize that this was my last chance to get to know her . I would never again live at home-apart for occasional visits at Christmas or Independence Day . Sometimes I ca n't help but think that if I 'd only been paying more attention , I might have been prepared for what happened to her later . It might not have happened at all , had I been watching for the signs that I can now only search my memory for .", "I walked down to the site of the accident and examined it for myself . Here was the place where the car had inexplicably gone off the road . They must have been going fast down that curving dirt road-in the dark , one would assume , though no one knew . They had to have been going so fast that the young , man-high saplings did n't slow them down . They flew over an embankment-since surely , if the tires had hit the strip of sand between the low cliff and the water , they would have stopped , merely bogged down in an unpleasant but eventually hilarious situation . Somehow , the car sailed over the sand . It hit the water and sank . The lake was shallow for several yards before it dropped off swiftly . Somehow , the car got past that , too .", 'When I walked along the edge of the road , there were no signs of any accident-no tire marks at the edge of the ditch , not even a broken sapling . Of course , almost two months had passed ; the elastic trees had straightened , summer plants had grown wild , rain had smoothed the ground .', '" I have half a mind to go out there and take down the whole damn addition , two-by-fours and all . "', 'My father laughed . " Can you see the look on her face ? " he said , and my mother chuckled deeply', '          my father said . " Do you ? " My mother said coldly .', 'After that , they were quiet . I heard a plate being set down on the table . I got up and went inside .', '" Nothing , " I said . I watched as their expressions tightened , as whatever they were talking about was buried away , out of sight . I was coming to realize that I did n\'t really know them very well . Somehow , twenty-twoyear-old Shorty had fallen in love with my mother , a sharp-tongued , thirty-two-year-old telephone operator . Somehow , they \'d stayed married for twenty years , and then , abruptly , somehow they \'d decided to give up . It did n\'t quite make sense , and           the other mystery in my life .', 'Perhaps this was what I thought of as my mother and I sat on the deck , as we often did on hot nights . We sat , smoking cigarettes , staring out at the dark shape of the lake-at the lights of houses on the other side           the air , which reminded me of the way the lit end of her cigarette would glow more intensely when she breathed in , and fade when she exhaled .', 'But it was the things that we did n\'t talk about that seemed most present . I wanted to know what she really thought of me ; what had really happened between her and my father ; what she was going to do with her life now . But it was if we were deep underwater-those conversations drifted over the surface , far above us , like the rippling shadows of rafts and swimmers that fish might notice , and startle at . I said ,           the year ? "', '" That part of the beach is going to be haunted , " I said . " Do n\'t you think ? "', "This was the way my mother had always been , as far as I could remember , though you do n't notice it as a child-or at least , I did n't . It seemed the natural course of things . I ca n't really guess what her life was like , from day to day . I recall only little things , mostly . I remember how ,           me put my fingers through the holes in those tight , tubelike curls . I would stretch her hair out to its full length and then watch it bounce back , perfectly , into its hollow shape against her skull . Then she would brush her hair until the curls turned into a kind of bubble around her head , perfectly round , like a helmet . She would hair-spray it until it was stiff . This was her late-morning ritual . She would drink coffee and watch television , or do crossword puzzles . When I wanted a hug or kiss , she would give it to me .", 'Lori was n\'t actually a real sister , though that was what my parents always called her . " Your sister , " they said . She was a stillborn baby whom I never saw . My parents had a grave for her , though , with a little headstone which they decorated with flowers on Memorial Day . There were , I learned later , a number of miscarriages between me and Lori , though none of them got very far along . Lori , on the other hand , was one           , and there was nothing , apparently , the doctors could do .', "My father and I were at the Fishhead one night , talking . He wanted me to play pool , and though I 'd never been any good at any sort of game , I agreed . I figured it was something I owed him , something a father and son should do together .", "I do n't know why this should have called up an image of my mother in extremis , but it did . Perhaps it was the way he glanced over his shoulder , edgily , worrying that someone might laugh at my ineptitude . Perhaps it was simply that we had been talking about her .", '" I do n\'t           lot of things bottled up inside her . " He struck , sending a striped ball into a pocket . He stared as it vanished . " Ah , Markus , " he said . " You know I tried to be a good husband to her . You know that I tried to be good to you both . I was a good dad to you , was n\'t it .

" he said . He looked at me , a slow , drunken film over his eyes , a sad and scornful look . " Do you think you can say why people do what they do ? They teach you that in college ?           when I was older , it was something I recalled , that expression . It was the stare of a man who has realized that he does n\'t know his son , and his son does n\'t know him . He shrugged . " Ah , well , " he said . " I just asked , " I said . " I \'m not doubting you . " He put his hand to his forehead , soddenly . " I \'ll tell you a story , " he said . " You probably do n\'t remember this , you were just a kid at the time . You remember when Lori was born ? " " Yes , " I said .', '"           I did n\'t take that kind of course . " " Mm , " my father said . He gazed down , running his thumb over a wet circle on the bar \'s varnished surface . " Well , anyways , " he said . " She was depressed . You know that . We struggled with it , I felt like . . . I had to watch her . You did n\'t know what she might do . She . . . well , she was at a point where she was a danger to herself . You remember . But it was hard . She had never been a weak person , you know , and . . . I was n\'t . . . I ca n\'t say I was doing so well that I could be the person for her to lean on . I never thought I \'d have to , you know , Markus ? I thought she \'d always be herself-like she was .', '" So I got out of bed , you know ? Maybe I was still part in a dream .... it must have been sometime after midnight , which was not all that unusual for her back then , she \'d wander around at all hours . But I had a funny feeling . And so I got up and I sort of-called to her , but she did n\'t answer . So I went out to the kitchen and then I could smell the gas from the stove . " She was n\'t herself then , Markus , " he said apologetically , though I was just sitting there , my face neutral and attentive . " She was n\'t even there , not really . I could see that . She was just standing , looking at the burners of the stove           . I could smell it pretty strong . And then I saw that she had a cigarette-it was n\'t lit-she had a cigarette in her mouth , and she was fingering her lighter in her hand , waiting . Thinking about it . I do n\'t know what I said . I think I said something like , Honey , do n\'t . \'', '" But , " I said . " She did n\'t do it . She decided not to do it . " My father gave me a tight smile . " I reckon she did n\'t , " he said . " We \'re still here , are n\'t we ? "', '" Why not ? " I said , and my voice felt hushed and ragged . I stared at the neon letters above the bar , which spelled out BEER . " What was there to say ? " my father said . " What do you say about something like that ? " Years later , I would try to replay this conversation in my mind , thinking it might hold some clue . I can only make up his words , though they sound honest in my imagination . I can picture my           awkwardly , on the sidewalk outside the bar , standing near our cars , and there was a moment when we might have hugged but did n\'t . " Goodbye , see you tomorrow ! " " Goodbye , sleep well ! " I must have gotten in my car and put the key into the ignition and my hands on the wheel . The night must have been dark , maybe with a little rain , and the thick trees along the roadside were heavy with foggy moisture , and the yellow line in the middle of the slick highway kept dividing , pulling apart like blurry amoebas beneath my beery gaze .', "I want to tell you that something else important happened that summer , that the mystery of the Morrisons was solved , that I finally understood my parents ' relationship , that my mother herself became suddenly clear to me .

I was going back to college in the fall , and I had to decide what I was going to do . I had this enormous , virgin expanse of time in front of me that needed to be claimed , and colonized , and strip-mined : my future .", "My mother , in her cabin bedroom , was asleep .

My father had died three years earlier , of a sudden stroke , fifty-two years old , buried beside Lori \'s tiny grave . Since then , I had n\'t been able to get any perspective on the things my mother told me . She had been saying strange things lately-the cabin spooked her , she said , she felt like someone           it , and finally she began to think that someone was trying to break in . Outside , she claimed to have found thin scrapes around the lock on the door-the new lock she \'d put in-and on the windows , scuff marks on the wood , as if someone were trying to jimmy them open .

The tree was at the very edge of the light from the kitchen , and for a moment it appeared to be a woman in a long robe-a nightgown , maybe . I jumped , and fled the house as quickly as I could . There are times , lots of times , when I think that maybe she is still alive . They never found her car , or her clothes , and her bank account was nearly empty . I can picture her , driving through various landscapes , her eyes straight ahead , her driving sunglasses reflecting the road . I see her living under an assumed name , in New Orleans , in Fargo , on a beach in Florida . Sometimes           I have the quavering sense that it might be her .

Of course it showed that I did n't .", "Finally , the doctor agreed to let me out if           day and night . They agreed , keeping me from my worst nightmare , winding up in a hospital for crazy people , just like both my father and my mother . Damned FBI knew what my worst fear was , but I would n't talk . I would n't confess to something I had n't done .", "Somewhat to my surprise , I discovered that I really believed in some aspects of the United States political system , such as the Bill of Rights . We had always believed that the FBI had rifled through oob 's office once in 1973 after we had received a communication from the Weather Underground ( nothing was stolen           but I had never imagined that if they wanted to go after me they would try to get me into a mental hospital rather than filing charges against me .

Then one of them told Nan about how Shatlow had been portraying her : " The first day of the trial , he called you Woody \'s forty-year-old lover !

Not that Yara was looking for love , so she may have missed it , though in Paris that would n\'t happen , she would have felt its dreamy heat . " The value of a thing is how much you will pay for it , " one rug merchant tells Anshe , looking at the stitching on his woven leather shoes . Anshe slides his feet under the cushion Yara is sitting on and presses his toes up under her so that she feels as if she might tip over onto the heap of rugs they \'ve endured over apple tea . " You must buy the one you love , " says the dealer . " And I will , " says Anshe blamelessly , rising to leave . There is , naturally , the love of rugs , in Istanbul , but not the kind of love that Yara left behind her in America .', "Yara tries to love Anshe by doing little , consequential favors for him when she thinks of it . She knows , for instance , that he likes to read the Herald Tribune first before she folds the pages backwards into quarters so that she can manage it . She leaves the news beside his coffee cup and pours enough milk for the color to fade from chocolate to toffee . She waits to read until he 's finished , for which he thanks her , noticing . He breaks his bread into pieces and dips it in the soft-boiled egg . Though mostly Anshe does favors for her , larger than hers and more promising ,           of kindness that seem to", 'He asks if she prefers the Turkish or Iranian saffron . He holds them toward her so that she may have her choice of long red strands or short golden ones . He likes to present to her the lessons of potentiality , to indicate in his gestures the multitude of options that only he can provide . " A man likes to satisfy the woman he loves , " he tells her , as if           and she could hold up her end of the other . She prefers the red saffron from Iran that comes in a flat , round jar . She prefers , as a place to sleep and eat , and shop for carpets , the quiet of the old quarter , Sultan Ahmet , down the hill from Haghia Sophia , to the fashionable European district of Beyoglu .', 'Anshe knows the man in America , though refuses to say his name . There is no reason for secrets when nothing , finally , can be hidden . They have spoken on occasion and are not friends . Once , when Anshe came home unexpectedly , he and the unspoken man fought and called each other words about nationality , about shape and size , about aging , and defended territories far beyond their actual borders . They were the picture of each other standing face to face , the one as perfect as the other , though utterly dissimilar , each complete , and this struck Yara as acquisitive on her part , wanting so much perfection for herself . She stood           a beaded gold bracelet , in the middle of the room . One had to have thrown the first punch , and later their stories agreed precisely as to the one . Neither tried to cheapen the event with hyperbole or heroics ; neither felt wholly defeated .', "The man she is traveling with is , Of course , her husband . You knew this           had chosen the kimono she was wearing that day from a roomful of fraying Asian textiles for the way the colors looked against her skin . The day of the fight she dragged the heavy silk of the sleeve in sudsy water , listening to what the two of them were saying . Anshe told the man to leave . His voice sounded like coarse pebbles grinding to dust in his mouth . The other voice had lowered to a growl . When they finished , together , the fighting exhausted in them , she stood near the heat of one man , then moved to examine the swollen face of the other . Any word she might have said felt mannered and abstract when the situation had no manners in it , only freedom and recognition , and what felt like finality . But the end of what , they wondered , each of them shocked by their own participation , each of them horribly serene . It was what it was-a man confronting his wife 's lover . The husband and wife would talk later . The man           talk too . There would be words then .", "She was no more able , than they were to share her , to take action in an utterance , to proffer the one           Anshe with his clenched face one inch from the other 's , the stark smell of week-old lilies purpling at the edges , a platinum light slicing itself across the floor through narrow bamboo blinds , the slow thwop of the ceiling fan , what looked like carnations of blood randomly exploding on the walls , a clump of tom hair on the window ledge , water drilling in the steel sink . If she sounds helpless you must try to imagine how she felt as the American gathered his things to go-his eyes cast around the room for his missing photographs , his hands trembled . She felt calm and slow and giddy and profoundly , pathetically owned .", '" Nothing hurts when it \'s happening , " Anshe tells her later , on the airplane . " You do it , and take it , and do n\'t feel anything at all , right then . " She thinks , " This is how it is for him . "', '" I am a peaceful man , " her husband says . " Next time I will smash his face . "', '" In a state of constant political precariousness , in a conflict whose only end is violence , certain freedoms we can not allow ourselves , " their driver allegorized on the way from the underground cisterns to the French Embassy at the head of the street where they want to walk . " Certain expressions we can not permit . " He stared at Yara in the rearview mirror . He tooted his horn and blinkered like Turkish drivers do in traffic .', 'It \'s raining harder now and they turn into the English language bookstore on Istiklal Cadessi . " You \'re mine , " the man in America said to her once . This enters her head the moment she steps into the warmth of the room filled with books . She wants to be . She takes the wet umbrella from Anshe and places it in a can away from the opulent collection of Ottoman Palace Plans , and Tribal Embroidery , and Maps of the Fallen World . She does n\'t want           though his offer has not been withdrawn .', "Yara had given the American man a celadon green cut velvet scarf that had been made for her by an artist in the city where she lives . The scarf hung over his bed and he burned it when she told him she was leaving for Istanbul . She had written him letters , between phone calls , between the times they 'd been together , which he also burned . She gave him an ivory carving of a fist that had at one time been a snuff box . The hand reminded her of his . When he came to Chicago to see her she placed it in his hand , which closed immediately around it . He studied her face , as if he were unaccustomed to receiving gifts , and then opened his fingers and memorized the small carving carefully before putting it in his pocket , with his knife and money clip . Between the cracks of the fingers , delicate black lines . You can see the suggestion of jealousy in the grip .", 'Anshe asked her to promise not to write to the man while she is in Istanbul . He is trying to love too , and this is what he requires of her to keep at it . Love is n\'t trading up , is what she has always believed . Love hopes . Well , they do n\'t know how very well-to love each other . Not to split into the **25;574;TOOLONG parts , and the **27;601;TOOLONG parts . " I want everything in one place , " she tells him . " I want only one life . "', "They find a perch in a third story window of a student-run mehune overlooking schools of pedestrians on the street below . It 's dusk and fans of white lights have come on in the shape of peacock tails on poles . Girls walk alone in platform shoes , or with a single friend . Dark Turkish youth strolls in fives . The young men talk on cellular phones that           say into the newfound signifier of their significance . Inside Yara and Anshe lean against old cushions made of camel sacks and argue about the usefulness of categorization by gender . In the bookstore he had been scanning a self-help book that makes every effort to explain what women want , and what men want , and the differences between what they want , in terms of brain function . She is more interested in specifics . Charlie-there , she said it-shares her intolerance for astrology , and eneograms , and the breakdown into Venus and Mars-ways to divide and classify that make one moment typify another . When he touches her he is not touching anyone else .", '" The way I wo n\'t divide the world in two , " she finishes his sentence . He lets this incongruity between what she does and what she says register , and           supper : soup and some warm bread . A pitcher of raki .', '" Like a lion , " the waiter says , scowling ferociously . " Milk of a lion make you roar . " He reaches for her camera on the bench beside her           offers , making use of his best English . The whole world conspires to keep what they perceive to be a solid , if not happy , marriage intact . The waiter brushes back his hair to show how hers has fallen into her face . Peering through the viewfinder , he motions them closer to fit into the same frame , and they move together , submissively , as two people might who did n\'t have a third person there between them .', "Next the musicians form part of a circle around their table with their instruments-a hand-held drum , a squash-bellied zither with twelve strings , a long , breathless clarinet . They play , in their distinctive quarter tones , not songs of romance , surely , but songs of Suleyman the 0 . magnificence , of Muhammed 's journey into the Seven Heavens , songs of spiritual starvation is what they sound like .", 'Yara shakes her head . Regrettably the musicians move to the next table .', '" Fighting did n\'t solve anything , did it ? " she shouts , going along . Though what she \'s actually thinking is , tongue \'s spice , row of teeth , even breath , the way the words you \'re mine embroider the heart with delicate , worn threads . When Anshe mentions it she begins to think , it shames her to admit , that all of them being in the same room may have been exactly what she \'d secretly wanted-the three of them together so that she would n\'t have to leave part of her life in one place while she went away to live the other part . It \'s utterly selfish , she knows , to want a thing like that . The musicians cease at last           I \'m grateful no one was hurt , worse , " Anshe says , showing her the place on the heel of his hand that has almost scarred over after a month . A chunk of skin had been gouged out-teeth or fingernail marks or a scrape against exposed brick . She thinks of the man in America \'s swollen jaw . He could n\'t shave . In her mind she places her hands gently on his two-day growth of beard . The fight had made being together for them feel slightly dangerous . They walked down the back stairs to avoid someone standing guard at the elevator . He pulled his car around behind his apartment to the alleyway , where Yara got in .', "Even the rug dealers in Istanbul speak of the symbols of harmonious longevity . Bereket , a fertile union , as evidenced in figs and pomegranates , poppies , heads of grain . Bukco , which means fetter , the sign of permanent union .

But where Princeton has employed the intervening centuries to pour forth a bounteous-if-bombastic stream of English majors , Bowman \'s Ridge has employed the same time to produce people who are actually , well , employable . Bowman \'s Ridge is populated exclusively by three major ethnic groups , the two most numerous of which are Natives and Transients . I \'ve lived here for twenty-five years , in one of the smaller authentic Colonial Era houses on Main Street . It has white clapboard siding , conservatively painted dark green shutters , the original eighteenth-century well , a floral clock , a flourishing herb garden , a rockery , and a paid-up           up here . I \'m still just a Transient . That \'s how the Natives would have it , anyway . On the other hand , at least I \'m a Transient that they can trust , or perhaps the word I want is tolerate . Just as long as I do n\'t bring up the unfortunate subject of how I earn my living , everything is roses . You see ( and here I ought to turn my face aside and drop my voice to the requisite hoarse whisper reserved for all such disgraceful confessions ) , I ... write . UNCLEAN ! UNCLEAN ! Someone get a firm hold on the carriage horses lest they stampede and make sure that : no pregnant women cross my path . I would n\'t like to be held responsible for the consequences . No , I am not taking on unnecessarily . I \'ve seen the looks I get on the street and in the stores . I \'ve heard the whispers : " There goes Babs Barclay . She writes . " ( lJttered in the same deliciously scandalized tone           to overdosing on Lydia Pinkham \'s elixir , cooking sherry , vanilla extract , and hair tonic . ) To the good folk of Bowman \'s Ridge , having a writer in their midst is rather like having a toothless , declawed cat in the chicken coop . The beastie may look harmless , logic may insist that in its present state sans fang and talon it is by fiat harmless , but the biddies still huddle together , clucking nervously , because ... You never know . I know what they are afraid of . It \'s the same fear that \'s always plagued small towns condemned to harbor the Pen Pushers from Planet Verbiage . It \'s the ultimate terror , which I first saw voiced by a secondary character in one of the Anne of Green Gables books when the heroine began to gamer some small success as an author : What if she puts us in one of her stories ? Not a direct quote , but it \'ll do . Forget what you think you know about fame . Not everyone wants his or her           \'s Ridge want it even less than the people of Avonlea , or Peyton Place , or any other small town that : had the poor judgment to allow writers to burrow into the wainscotting and nest for the winter . They are simple , honest , hardworking folk , who will take a simple , honest tire iron to your head if you so much as hint that you \'re going to make the outside world aware of their existence . ( I think that the surplus of deferred fame-bites gets funneled into an offshore account where Donald Trump \'s ego , Michael Jackson \'s manhood , and Madonna \'s uterus spend much too much time making withdrawals . I could be wrong . ) It does n\'t do me a lick of good to explain to my friends and neighbors that their fears are for naught . I write romances . Historical romances . Books with titles like Druid \'s Desire and Millard Filmore , My Love . The only way I \'d write about anyone from Bowman \'s Ridge is if they were romantic , famous ,           into one of my books than a taxman into heaven , a linebacker into leotards , or a small , sharp sliver of unicorn horn into a nice big slice of Greta Marie Bowman \'s apple pie . " Ow ! " It was a snoozy afternoon in mid-November and I was seated at the counter in the coffee shop when it happened . The coffee shop in Bowman \'s Ridge is the nexus for all manner of social interaction , from personal to political . I \'m afraid my Transient heart does n\'t get all revved up over the Planning and Zoning Commission \'s latest bureaucratic brouhahaha or the Women \'s Club \'s plans for yet another authentic Colonial weekend to honor the memory of our own Captain James Resurrection Bowman 11717-1778 ) . I go there because the coffee is good but the apple pie is downright fabulous . Or so I thought , until I found the figurative needle in the Northern Spies . Carefully I put three fingers into my mouth and drew out the thing that had stung me , tongue and palate . I           fragments of cooked apple and flaky crust . I have no idea why I went to the trouble . Would it make any difference to my throbbing mouth if I got the barb clean before seeing what it was ? I might as well have saved myself the effort and simply spit it out . Even clean and wiped dry on a paper napkin , it was nothing I could put a name to . About as long as the first joint of my little finger and one-quarter as wide , it caught the light from the coffee shop overheads and shimmered like the inside of an abalone shell . " Something wrong , dear ? " Muriel \'s shadow fell over the object of my attention . Muriel and her husband Hal own and run the Bowman \'s Ridge coffee shop . I like to think that they belong to some mystic fraternal order of interior decorators - the Harmonic Knights of the Cosmic Balance , Fabric Swatch and Chowder Society - for the way they keep the place charming without being cloying . Anyone who \'s dallied in           an eatery to sink into the La Brea Cute Pits . Either the management heaps on the prt-d-porter antiques , or wallows in frills and dimity , or worst of all , beats it with the Quaint stick until it catches a case of Terminal Rusticity from the knotty-pine paneling and dies . Hal and Muriel just serve good food , never patch the vinyl counter stools with duct tape , adorn the place suitably for holidays , and periodically change the basic decor according to the grand , universal imperative of We Felt Like It . Oh ! And they never shop at Everything Guernseys , thanks be to God , Jesus , Ben and Jerry . Muriel has never treated me like a Transient and she sees to it that all the waitresses know how I take my coffee ( black , two sugars ) without my having to tell them every time . She even awarded me the supreme accolade , posting a Happy Birthday , Babs message on the whiteboard where they display the daily Specials . This privilege is as good as telling the world           , but I was one of the Transients they could take out of the attic on visiting days to show the neighbors . I like Muriel a lot . So of course I lied to her . " Nuh-uh , " I said , hastily clapping my hand over the extracted sliver . " Nothing \'s wrong , not a thing , great pie . " Muriel gave me a searching look , but all she said was , " Yes , Greta Marie said she \'s gotten some superior apples this season . " Then one of the waitresses came up to tell her she was wanted in the kitchen and she was gone . Left to myself once more , I uncovered the sliver and picked it up delicately between thumb and forefinger . It twinkled with all the hues of prism-shattered light , but it was made of no substance I could name . The man on the stool next to me cast a curious glance at it , but promptly went back to reading his newspaper . People in this town do n\'t pry . Why           faster than a ferret on amphetamines ? : Sooner or later , everyone knows everything about everyone else . Well , I thought , it \'s very attractive , whatever it is . I \'ll bring it home ; maybe Rachel can make something out of it . Rachel is my teenaged daughter . She has discovered the Meaning of Life , which is to make jewelry out of any object you find lying around the house , yard , or municipal dump , and pierce another part of your body to hang it from . At least this object was pretty , and I always say that a good soak in Clorox will clean anything , up to and including Original Sin . I was so fascinated by the way the light played off my little bit of found art that I did n\'t notice Muriel \'s return until I heard her say , " Uh-huh . Thought so . " Caught in the act , I tried to cover up my sorry attempt at willful misdirection by dropping the sliver onto the open pages of the magazine I           the glossy cover shut on it . Slapping my hand over the bare-chested male model on the cover , I gave Muriel a sickly smile . " Dropped a contact , " I said . " I do n\'t want it to fall on the floor . " No dice . You ca n\'t take out a woman who can tell good tuna salad from bad at fifty paces . " Honey , who are you trying to protect ? " she said . " Greta Marie ? You do n\'t even know her . " That was true . Greta Marie Bowman belonged to the third and smallest segment of Bowman \'s Ridge society : Eccentrics . As my dear mother would say , an eccentric is what you call a lunatic who \'s got money . Mom was speaking from the jaded , materialistic perspective of big city life , however . In places like Bowman \'s Ridge , we realize that money does n\'t excuse abnormal behavior . You do n\'t have to be rich and crazy to be classed as an eccentric ; you can be           the scion of one of the town \'s oldest families . Or in Greta Marie Bowman \'s case , the scionette . Yes , she was the descendant of that Bowman . And yes , she was living in what the Victorians referred to as genteel poverty . Whatever mite of income she derived from her ancestors " surviving investments needs must be eked out by the sale of apple pies to the coffee shop . This was one of those cold , hard facts that everyone knew and no one mentioned . A Mafia don brought up to follow the steel-jacketed code of silence , omerta , is a harebrained blabbermouth next to a resident of Bowman \'s Ridge who \'s got something not to say . " Look , it \'s nothing , " I said . " I may not know her , but I certainly do n\'t want to get her in - " " Trouble ? " Muriel finished for me . She sighed . " Babs , you want to know the meaning of the word ? That thing you just found in your           someone else had found it ? " " Not much . Everyone around here knows Greta Marie and no one would say anything that would - " " Think that goes for the Summer People ? " Na-na-na-naaaaah . Cue the sinister chords on the pipe organ . The only critters lower on the Bowman \'s Ridge food chain than Transients are Summer People . I do n\'t know why the Natives despise them so . They are the single best thing to happen to the local economy since maple-leafshaped anything . They swarm up here every june , July and August , with a recurring infection come leaf-peeping time , and pay top dollar to stay in spare rooms that would otherwise be mold sanctuaries . They attend church bazaars and rummage sales , fighting to the death to buy the nameless tin and wicker doohickeys that the Natives clean out of Aunt Hattie \'s attic . ( Aunt Hattie could never tell what the hell that bug-ugly objet d , awful was either . ) And of course if you \'ve got any piece of housetrash , no           you have to do is stencil a pig or a sunflower or a black-and-white cow on it and it \'s outahere , courtesy of the Summer People . On the other hand , serve them a slice of pie that \'s packing a concealed shiv and they \'ll bring the Board of Health down on your head faster than you can sell them a busted butter chum . " I see what you mean , " I said . " But the season \'s over , the Summer People are all gone , and - " " Skiers , " Muriel reminded me . " Snowmobilers . " " Oh . " I \'d forgotten that , like weasels , when winter came the Summer People changed their coats and returned to our little town in swarms . " It really would be a kindness to tell her . " Muriel patted my hand in a motherly way . " Wo n\'t you please ? " " Ummmm . Why do n\'t you ? " " Oh , I could n\'t ! " She laid her hands to her bosom           if I did . She does n\'t take criticism too well , poor child . " Only Muriel would refer to a spinster pushing fifty-five as poor child , bless her . " She \'d stop baking pies for us altogether . She needs the money , though she \'d never admit it . What would become of her then ? It \'d be plain awful . " In my heart I agreed with Muriel , though more out of my love for the pies than any concern for the pie-maker \'s welfare . " But if she does n\'t take criticism well , how could I say - ? " I began . Muriel pish-tushed me like a champion . " But it \'s different if it comes from you , Babs . " I did n\'t need to ask why . Was n\'t it obvious ? I was a Transient . My cautionary words concerning unidentified opalescent objects in the pastry would n\'t shame Greta Marie the way a Native \'s would . In fact , if I were to go to Greta Marie \'s place and accuse           shortening , she could live it down . So I went . Greta Marie lived out on the Old Toll Road . This was a stretch of highway so narrow , frost-heaved and godforsaken that the fact that someone had once collected real American money from travelers to allow them the privilege of breaking their axles in the ruts and potholes was a testimony to Yankee ingenuity , to say nothing of Yankee gall . There was hardly enough room for two cars to pass , unless one climbed up onto the shoulder at a forty-five degree angle , bumping over the gnarled roots of pine trees flanking the way . Luckily , the Old Toll Road had gone from being a throughway leading to Montpelier to a dead end leading to nowhere when the bridge over Bowman \'s Gorge collapsed in 1957 . The town decided it would be a waste of money to rebuild it , since by then everyone took the State highway anyway , and that pretty much put an end to the two-way traffic problem . That is , it did unless you happened to           Greta Marie Bowman was headed down it . She drove an old Rambler the color of mud with a crumpled fender and enough dings in the sides to make it look like the only car on the road suffering from cellulite . Wonderful to relate , she could actually get that bundle of battered tin up to considerable speeds , even over the humps and hollows of the Old Toll Road . Wonderful to relate if you \'re safely out of the way , terrifying to tell if you \'re driving the car that \'s right in her path . Like a deer caught in the headlights , I spied the glitter of Greta Marie \'s Coke-bottle glasses and I froze . My hands spasmed tight to the steering wheel , my foot refused to move from the accelerator , and the only thing I could think was : Dear Lord , if I die , what the hell body part will Rachel pierce to commemorate the funeral ? I felt like a complete idiot when Greta Marie brought her vehicle to a ladylike stop with room to spare and           She peered over the steering wheel like a marmot testing the first sniff of spring air , then dropped from sight behind the dashboard . One hefty car door swung wide and she was walking toward me , all smiles . I lowered the window to greet her and was nearly bowled into the next county by her preferred scent , Eau de Mothballs , but in the name of preserving the honor of all Transients , I managed to dig up a smile of my own and paste it to my face . " You \'re that writer-person ! " was how Greta Marie Bowman chose to say hello . " Um , yes , I am . " " Oh , I knew you \'d come ! Really I did ! " She clapped her hands together with girlish glee . " You did ? " This was news to me . I was n\'t sure whether it was good news . In her oversized , out-at-elbows black cardigan , with her steel gray hair anchored to the top of her head with at least three pairs of           of a large , amiable spider . " My gracious , and when I think that we almost missed each other entirely - ! " She spoke in the chirpy , lockjawed accents of a young Katharine Hepburn . " Now you just follow me up to the house and we \'ll talk . " And then , as God is my witness , she gave me a roguish wink , went back to her car , and backed up at speed all the way to the ancestral Bowman property , which lay a good quarter mile or more up the Old Toll Road . From what I had gathered in my quarter century of Bowman \'s Ridge residence , the Bowmans had always been farmers , but they made a better living selling off the land than tilling it . The hard soil of their property let a diligent man grow him a bumper crop of rocks , though only if he was willing to work for it . The last male Bowman to inhabit the place had been Greta Marie \'s grandfather , dead lo these many years           , he \'d sold most of it . The only exceptions were the ancestral apple orchard , a swampy meadow beyond that , and the homestead plot . This latter supported a meager vegetable garden , a dilapidated chicken coop and poultry yard , the half of the old barn that was still standing , and the Bowman house proper . All of these flashed before my eyes as Greta Marie hauled me out of my car and into the front parlor where she assaulted me with tea . " Now the important family papers are mostly safe in the attic , " she said , pouring out some oolong strong enough to strip paint from metal . " I can let you have those today , but the best sources are Caroline Elspeth \'s notebooks , and they \'re over in Brattleboro at Cousin Victoria \'s house . She said she was going to do something with them , but everyone knows how far that got . Vicky never finished anything in her entire life except her husbands . " I took a sip of tea , set the           beg your pardon ? " Greta Marie slapped a wrinkled hand over her mouth and , as I hope for glory , tittered like a chipmunk . " Oh mercy , there I go again . I forgot : You \'re not from around here . You would n\'t know about Vicky . " And with that , she proceeded to bring me up to speed on Cousin Victoria Bowman Randall Smith Chasen , her antecedents and her heirs . It was a lengthy recitation that left me knowing more about the Bowman family and any related Native families-which is to say everyone in town- than I \'d ever wanted or needed to know . When she was done , I gazed down at my now-frigid cuppa and murmured , " That was ... very interesting , Miss Bowman , but I do n\'t see- " " -how you can use all that for your book ? Well , of course you ca n\'t use all of it , " Greta Marie reassured me . " After all , I would n\'t be very bright if I gave away everything           own book as well . I \'m sure you wo n\'t begrudge me that much ? Mine wo n\'t be nearly as fascinating as yours , but then you \'ve had so much more exrerience , you have connections , and as Daddy always used to say , when you \'ve got connections , who needs talent ? " Another giggle , this one ending in a snort . " All I want to write about is the branch of the family that settled near Brattleboro , old Zerusha Bowman \'s boys and that Martin woman - you know , she swore she came from Boston , but everyone here just knew she was from New York . " Pronounced Sodom . It was then that the diaphanous phantom of Understanding tiptoed up and tapped me gently on the cranium with an iron mallet . To this day I could n\'t tell you whether my subsequent spate of blather was more of an apology for not having come to use the generations of Bowmans past as raw material for my next book , or an explanation for why I had           regarding the shining sliver I held out to her in my cupped hand . " I see . " If she were at all disappointed , she bore it well and swallowed it whole . " That certainly was careless of me . Thank you so much for bringing it to my attention . " She stood up from behind the tea things , which I assumed was my cue to scurry back into the Transient woodwork , duty done . As it happened , I was wrong . No sooner had I risen to my feet , stammering some social pleasantry about having to go home now , I \'d left the children on the stove , but Greta Marie raised one briary brow and inquired , " Then you \'d prefer to come back another time to see the unicorns ? " Three minutes later , to the tick , I was outside the Bowman house with Greta Marie , leaning my elbows on the top of a drunken split-rail fence that marked the boundaries of the meadow . And there , prancing and pawing the spongy ground           slightest provocation , were the unicorns . There were three of them , all a luminous white so pure as to be almost ice-blue , with flossy manes the color of smoke glimpsed by moonlight . Even without the timehonored single horn in the middle of the forehead , it would be impossible to confuse these entrancing beasts with the most thistledown-footed thoroughbred . Which was a good thing , because ... " Their hon.is , " I gasped . " Where are their horns ? " I leaned farther over the fence , staring at the three dancing shapes in the meadow . " All they \'ve got are these .. lumps . " " Lumps ? " ( ; reta Marie shaded her eyes , as if that gesture could hope to counteract a truly heroic case of myopia . She sighed . " Oh dear . It \'s happened again . Wait here . " She left me teetering on the gateway to Wonderland as she trudged off to a nearby toolshed , to return with a small , bright hacksaw in hand . Setting two fingers           The unicorns heard and the effect was galvanic . They paused in their frolic , heads up , ears pricked forward , a pose of frozen loveliness so exquisite that it hurt my heart to see it . Then they broke from a standstill to a gallop , three clouds of lightning racing across the meadow . For an instant I was afraid that they meant to charge right through the fence God knows , it did n\'t look strong enough to halt a stampede of bunnyrabbits - but I need n\'t have worried . Dainty cloven hooves planted themselves hard and decidedly in the earth just a handspan from the fence , bright garnet eyes twinkling with amusement . I could have sworn that the critters were laughing at me . Just so I would n\'t make that mistake in future , the largest of the three curled his lips back from a double row of nastily pointed teeth and did laugh at me . It was a sound birthed at the junction of a horse \'s whinny , a stag \'s belled challenge , and a diva \'s           giving me more than enough time to study him . His eyes were , as I \'ve mentioned , a deep , gem-like crimson , very large , highly intelligent , and possessed of an almost human capacity for malice . And yes , there in the place where tradition dictates the horn must be , there sprouted a pearly lump . Small as it was , I could see that it was n\'t to grow into the sleek pool-cue object some folks fancied , nor was it the twisty narwhal tusk others preferred their unicorns to sport . It was multisided , multi-edged , and the edges thereof fuzzy with the added menace of minute , vicious serrations , almost barbs . At full growth it would be deadly , and not an easy death either . Just looking at it made my skin go cold . The unicom cocked his head at me as if to say , Seen enough , rube ? Take a picture ; it lasts longer . Then he swung his muzzle away to plant a long , snuffly kiss on Greta Marie \'s           there \'s a fine fellow . " Greta Marie stroked the slab of silky white cheek . " Now just hold still , this wo n\'t hurt a bit . " Placing one hand on the unicorn \'s nose , she used the other to ply the hacksaw . The steel blade bit into the base of the resurgent hom , which made a frightful screeching as it was severed . The unicorn submitted to the operation with that air of gallant indifference popularized by the better class of 18th century highwaymen about to swing at Tyburn Tree . Greta Marie worked quickly . There was a dull plop as the hom-nub hit the dirt . " There , " said Greta Marie . She fluffed up a little fur to cover the newly raw spot on the unicom \'s forehead and announced , " Next ! " I watched with a combination of fascination and revulsion as she proceeded to treat the two remaining miracles as if they were parlor cats getting their claws clipped . When the third shining stub fell to earth , she sighed with satisfaction           a flock of buff Orpingtons , the unicorns took off for the far end of the meadow , the place where boggy grassland melted into a small patch of wildwood . They flickered under the shadows of the leafless branches , then turned to fog and were gone from sight . " Well , we wo n\'t be seeing any more of them today , " Greta Marie declared , stooping to gather the fallen nubbins . Still dumbfounded , I followed her back into the house where I watched her set the hom-nubs on a butcher \'s block cutting board and whack them to flinders with a cleaver . Using the flat of the blade , she scraped the resulting pile of iridescent toothpicks into an old stoneware crock marked Garlic . " You ... save them ? " I asked . She gave me a look that as good as accused me of Wastefulness , chief among the Seven Deadly Sins of Transients . " I use them , " she replied . " Er , howl " Visions of an alchemist \'s lab hidden in the old           huddled over her bubbling alembics , a stuffed corkindrill suspended above her head while she added a pinch of unicom \'s hom to her latest batch of hellbroth . " Why , I simply-Never mind , it would be easier to show you . Do you have a minute to spare ? Several ? " And with that she opened a cabinet and donned not the wizard \'s pointed hat , but the cook \'s muslin apron . Still without waiting for my yea or nay , she proceeded to favor me with the privilege of witnessing the process by which Greta Marie Bowman took plain apples , sugar , spice , and pastry , and confected them into the food of the gods . When at last she dropped the top crust into place over the mounded fruit filling and fluted the edges , she turned to me and commanded , " Watch . " From the Garlic cannister she took one splinter of unicorn \'s hom and with five deft jabs opened steam slits in the piecrust . " There . That \'s how I use them .           a jelly jar on the windowsill above her sink before popping the pie into the oven . " You can get about three perfect pies out of each one , " she informed me . " After that they crumble into dust - the horns , not the pies . But the dust makes a wonderful scouring powder - gets out every stain you can think of and a few you ca n\'t - so I do n\'t feel too bad about getting so little use out of them . And the critters are always growing new ones . " She removed her apron and folded it over the back of a kitchen chair . " I ca n\'t imagine where my mind was when I let that splinter you found slip into the pie . Oh wait , yes I can . That must \'ve been the day I was in such a terrible hurry , and it seemed like every time I turned around , the phone was ringing itself off the hook . No wonder I got all muddled , between trying to get the Congregational Church           Ed Franklin had come by that week to bring me three extra bushels of Cortlands - he \'s had a bumper crop this year . I know he meant it to be kind , but I had my own apples to use and I knew that if I did n\'t get his Cortlands baked up they were going to go bad on me . Not that it matters anymore - I could use rotten apples in my pies and the horn would turn them to nectar , just nectar - but old habits do die hard . My mother raised me to bake a decent apple pie and I ca n\'t do any less . " She finally paused for breath , plucked the kettle from the stove , and beamed at me . " More tea ? " I left her house about an hour later , burdened with the apple pie , the Bowman family papers , the promise to at least try to write Jim Bowman \'s Woman , and a vow of silence : Under no circumstances was I to tell a single , living soul           . As Greta Marie herself told me , the only reason she went to all the trouble of sawing off the creatures " telltale horns was so that unexpected callers who caught sight of them would assume they were only horses . " But if you want to keep them a secret , why did you show them to met " I \'d asked . " Oh , you \'re different , " Greta Marie reassured me . " It does n\'t matter if you know about them . " Right . Sic semper Transientis , or however you \'d say Transients Do n\'t Count in Latin . I went back to the coffee shop to make my Mission Accomplished report to Muriel . I was promptly rewarded with a cup of coffee , a glazed donut , and the question : " So which one of the unicorns is your favorite ? " " Nurk ? " I replied , mouth stuffed with a chunk of donut that bid fair to wedge itself in my throat if I let shock get the better of me . I chewed vigorously           comic strip anarchist to wlusper , " You know ? " Muriel chuckled . " Bless your heart , Babs , everyone knows . Only no one says anything . You know , I ca n\'t say we were at all surprised when the first one showed up , oh , maybe ten , twelve years ago . It was the middle of winter , long about Christmas time , when we have the Pinecone Handcrafts Fair at the firehouse ; you know . Greta Marie \'s car was in the shop so Sally Norton and her boy Ron offered to drive up the Old Toll Road to fetch Greta Marie there and back . They pulled up into her yard and that \'s when they saw her and it . She \'d already sawed the creature \'s horn clean off , but even so , even in the nighttime with no more light to see by than the spill off that old kerosene lantern she leaves burning near the gatepost , there was no way a sighted person could ever believe that was a horse ! Of course Sally           " Of course not , " I mumbled . " And if you ask me , it was that natural when the other two joined the first one . Frankly I \'m kind of puzzled that there are n\'t more than three haunting the Bowman place . Maybe three unicorns are all that \'s left in this part of the state , and it \'s no wonder they \'ve all come to roost with Greta Marie . " " It is ? " " Of course it is ! Lord love you , Babs , do n\'t tell me that an educated city woman like you does n\'t know what it takes to attract a unicom ? " City woman ? Twenty-five years ago , maybe . Which translates into Bowman \'s Ridge-ese as yesterday . And I did know what it takes to attract a unicorn . " Oh , come on , Muriel ! " I protested . " Do n\'t you stand there and try to tell me that Greta Marie is the one and only virgin in this whole town ! " Muriel \'s eyes twinkled           n\'t be true , anyhow . But how long does your average virgin last , these days ? Sixteen , seventeen years at most , and that \'s like an eyeblink of time to a unicom . They \'re immortal , you know , " she confided . " I may belong to a different generation , but I \'m not blind or stupid . We all know what goes on with our young people , especially since the govemment \'s been making them go to that regional high school at Miller \'s Falls . " Pronounced Sodom again , and no matter that the government redistricting edict was handed down in 1953 , when even Vegas was wholesome . " You see , " Muriel went on , " it \'s not just that Greta Marie \'s a virgin , it \'s that she \'s so damn good at it . Pardon my French . " " So everyone knows and no one objects ? " I asked . " Why should they ? She \'s a respectable member of this town and if she wants to raise mythical           ... as long as she keeps them under proper control at all times and they do n\'t pose any threat to the community . " " That \'s comforting to know , " I said with a merry chuckle that did n\'t become me at all . ( The glazed donut had gone straight to my brain and the sugar rush convinced me I could try my hand at wit . ) " You see , I found this darling little dragon \'s egg on my lawn last Easter and I was worried that if I hatched it , people would talk . " Muriel stared at me blankly for the count of three , then said , " You writers , " and took off as if the kitchen had caught fire . I was left alone at the counter , Dorothy Parker manqug , with nothing to hide my blushes save my coffee cup and my copy of With Pen and Passion . The cup being empty , I chose to go to ground behind the cover of the very magazine between whose pages I had dropped the           best place to mention that With Pen and Passion is one of the many fine periodicals to which I subscribe as part of my career as a romance writer . WiPP , as we in the trade call it , is a slick monthly whose chief allure is the book review column . That is to say , whose chief allure had been the book review column . As long as we \'re opening narrative parentheses , let the worst now be revealed : His name was Wellcome Fisher and he was my own damned fault . I \'d met him at a romance writers " convention in New York City about ten years ago . He was an aspiring author , scion of a proud old New England family , almost attractive in a tweedier-than-thou kind of way , well-bred , well-read , pumped full of the Wisdom of the Ancients at the ivy-covered tit of Mother Princeton , raring to put pen to word processor and make his genius known to the fortunate masses . There was just one little thing standing in the way of his brilliant           course I did n\'t know this from the start . He seemed like such a nice man . ( Many successful romance writers are male , you know . They all write under female pseudonyms unless they \'re Fabio or churning out mainstream lunchblowers like The Bridges of Madison County . ) He introduced himself , said how much he admired my work , and asked if he could buy me a drink . He bought me several . It was all strictly professional . We had a lovely , long chat about the importance of research in writing historical romance . He told me that he was always extremely punctilious about his research , and he did n\'t understand why the one book he had managed to sell was doing so poorly . " I do n\'t merely say Gwendolyn stood before her mirror wearing a velvet gown , " he told me . " I put in details . " And he gave me an autographed , copy of Lady Gwendolyn \'s Gallant so that I could see for myself . I did , once I got it           . His book gave me a painfully thorough education about the provenance of food , clothing , furniture , music , and transportation in Regency England . It told me who ate what and how much of it , who slept where and for how long , and who used which finger to excavate whose nostril . In fact , it told me everything except an entertaining story . We had exchanged telephone numbers , so when the inevitable happened and he called to ask my opinion of his work , I found myself in a bit of a quandary . I do n\'t like to lie , I just do it for a living . However , neither do I like to tell someone that his book , his effort , his hardbound baby , stinks like a gopher \'s armpit . For one thing , it \'s cruel . For another , it \'s dangerous . Alas for the world , we now no longer know which eager young writer will take constructive criticism as an invitation to assassination . So I hedged . I evaded all direct           and blithered about a plethora of other subjects in an attempt to divert Wellcome Fisher from the original aim of his call . Unfortunately , one of the subjects on which I blithered was the fact that WiPP was looking for a few good book reviewers . Wellcome heard , applied , and the rest was history , much like the Hindenberg , the Titanic , and the Reagan Years . From the moment he got the job , he announced that he would now devote his fair young life to the aesthetic improvement of the Romance genre . It was a noble aim , in theory . In practice he appeared to have slapped on a pair of six-shooters and gone out gunning for authors whose work had committed the unpardonable sin of having a better track record than his . ( Which is to say , everybody and Cain \'s dog . ) He implemented this game plan by reducing any book he reviewed to a pitiful clutch of execrables , derivatives , pathetics , and do n\'t bothers . Any book , including mine . Though we           me that he would not let our acquaintanceship sway his critical judgment , and he proved this by a scathing review of Raleigh , Truly ( Sixth in my ever-popular Elizabethan series ) . Furthermore , said he , I ought to be grateful . He was only being honest . I , in turn , informed him that I thought his critical judgment consisted entirely of bloodyminded revenge on writers who , unlike himself , had managed to create something people wanted to read . What was more , he might call it honesty , but anyone with half a glass eye could see that he had more axes to grind than Paul Bunyan . The rest of our interview is clouded in my mind , but I believe that a condescending remark on his part , a bowl of extra-chunky salsa on mine , and a dry-cleaning bill for a man \'s suit figure in it somewhere . If only the chunks had been larger ! Wellcome sustained no permanent injuries from the episode . He wrote on , his pen unblunted and his bile unmitigated , an           since you asked ) . As a matter of fact , the very issue of WiPP into which I had slipped the odd finding from my apple pie likewise contained Wellcome \'s review of my latest novel , Beloved Babylonian . I \'d been waiting to read it until I was sure we were all out of razors . Why did I let his reviews do this to me ? Even though I knew he trashed everyone \'s books equally , even though I knew he wrote solely out of envy and spleen , his words still had the power to wound , or at least to give me the stray twinge in the coccyx . When he wrote romances , he bludgeoned whole chapters to death with a stack of research books as high as it was dry , but when he wrote reviews , he was the undefeated master of a myriad barbed bitcheries . We writers claim to be indifferent to any voice save that of our Muse , but we writers lie . Living among the stoic folk of Bowman \'s Ridge for twenty-five years had           . However , it had taught me the simple , rock-ribbed lesson most hardscrabble folk learn early : Get the worst out of the way first . I decided to read Wellcome \'s review , swallow his abuse , question his masculinity and curse his name , all so that I \'d be able to enjoy the rest of the magazine in peace afterward . Fans of Barbara Barclay \'s stunning Elizabethan series will rejoice to learn that the justly praised First Lady of the Torrid Quill is now also the Queen of Sizzling Cuneiform . Beloved Babylonian takes you on a breathless , breakneck , no-holdsbarred roller coaster ride of ecstacy through the reign of that hottest of historic hunks , Hammurabi himself . No wonder they called it the Fertile Crescent ! If you want to read the best and the brightest that this field has to offer , then I urge you to run , do n\'t walk , to your local prosemonger and buy your copy now ! If these books do n\'t fly off the shelves , they \'ll set theta on fire . "           gently by the shoulder . " You \'ve just been sitting here for the past ten minutes staring off at nothing . You all right ? " " Uhhhh , sure , " I said , and clutching my copy of WiPP to my heaving bosom , I fled . I did n\'t stop fleeing until I was safe at home , up in my office , with the door shut and the cat banished . I did n\'t like doing the latter . Like many another writer \'s cat , my gray tabby Gorbaduc has aided my career immeasurably by critiquing all my manuscripts with her asshole . It was the only thing that she and Wellcome Fisher ever had in common . Until now . I read the other reviews . Each was as glowing and brimming with bouquets as the love-feast he \'d laid out for Beloved Babylonian . I put down the magazine , unable to move , unable to speak , and more than a little inclined to scream . I \'m a flexible sort , but to accept the fact that Wellcome Fisher would           acquire the elasticity of a boneless belly-dancer . Wellcome \'s abandonment of acrimony was the apocalyptic harbinger that St. John missed , the Unlisted Number of the Beast . I do n\'t like it when my whole world pitches itself tush over titties without a word of warning . It frightens me . " What \'s happened to that man ? " I mused aloud . " Is he sick ? Is he insane ? He could n\'t have gone nice on us spontaneously . What could put him in a charitable mood ? Oh God . Oh no . Oh please do n\'t let it be that he \'s actually gone and sold another of his books ! Even vanity presses could n\'t be that unprincipled . No , it ca n\'t be that . It \'s too horrible to contemplate . He must be up to something else , and it \'s something big and nasty or he would n\'t be trying to put us off guard with a few kind words . " I re-read his review column and my hands went damp and cold . "           to have to be something really big , and really , really nasty . " I shuddered to think what that something might be . Wellcome Fisher had little talent , but like the Spanish Inquisition \'s primo torturer he was a man of bottomless invention , mostly vindictive . This was not going to be pretty . Existential fear is one thing dinner \'s another . Every writer is allowed only so much time to wallow in the great trough of emotional resonance , with all-day privileges extended solely to those of us foresighted enough to be born male and to have obtained that handy labor-saving device , a wife . This was not the case for me , and while my husband is a dear who " helps with the housework " ( Translation : " Where do we keep the butter ? Where \'s the frying pan ? Are you sure we have a potato peeler ? " ) he was out of town on yet another of his ever-recurring business trips . ( Alas , the darling of my heart is in Sales , and I           or unmarried , you know . ) A glance at my desk clock told me that time and frozen fish-sticks wait for no man and so , using that wonderful human survival skill called If I stop thinking about it , it will go away , I purposely put Wellcome Fisher \'s aberrant reviews from my mind and hied myself downstairs to the kitchen . The plates were on the table , Grace was said , and Rachel had just informed me that squash was Politically Incorrect ( and gross ) , when the telephone rang . I scowled -- first at the phone , then at Rachel - and announced , " If that \'s one of your friends , they know very well that it \'s the dinner hour and I \'m going to tell them they can just call back later . " This said , I picked up the receiver . " What is the meaning of this flagrant violation of my Constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression , you pandering troll ? " a voice boomed in my ear . " Oh . Hello , Wellcome           friend to call back later , too , Mom ! " Rachel called out joyously . ( When did any daughter of mine develop such a provoking smirk , I \'d like to know ? ) " It \'s all right , dear , it \'s no friend of mine ; it \'s a critic , " I replied , not bothering to cover the mouthpiece . " Eeeuuuwww . " Rachel made a face even more contorted by revulsion than when I \'d served her squash . Truly I had raised her well . I returned my attention to my caller : " All right , Fisher , what are you yapping about. ? " " You know damned well that to which I refer , Barbara Barclay , you sorry hack . I call your attention to the December issue of With Pen and Passion , my review column in particular . " " I \'ve seen it , " I told him . " Really , Wellcome , you were much too kind . Much . " I could almost see the apoplectic color rising in his           well right I was much too kind ! If I were n\'t so fornicating kind you \'d be getting this call from my lawyer ! " " Of course I would , " I replied serenely . At last I had my answer : He was insane . Multiple personality disorder at the very least . He must \'ve written those reviews under the brief influence of the Good Wellcome Fisher , and now that Evil Wellcome had reasserted sovereignty , he wanted to shift the blame . " Do n\'t condescend to me , jade . And do n\'t try to convince me that this is none of your doing . I know exactly what I wrote about that hideous mound of toxic verbiage you call Beloved Babylonian , and this review is not it ! Nor are any of the others printed therewith the work of my pen . Oh , you \'ll pay for this effrontery , Barbara . J\'accuse ! " It had been ages since Rachel was a bratty two-year-old , but it was remarkable how quickly I recovered the patient , measured tone of           dear , before I put in a long-distance call to the wacko-wagon down in your neck of the woods , would you mind telling me how you think I managed to change your precious spew - I mean , reviews ? " " Ha ! As if you did n\'t know . Thanks to a barbarous mob of so-called readers whose vulgar tastes are directly responsible for the imminent fall of Western Civilization , you are an author who is - who is not without - " Something was sticking in his craw , but he made the effort and horked up : " -who is not without some influence in the publishing world . " Ah , so he \'d built his palace of paranoia on that little patch of quicksand . I was a Name in the field of Romance , therefore I could prevail upon the publishers of WiPP to delete Wellcome \'s real reviews and insert some of my own creation . Sure , I could . Now that I saw whither his twisted thoughts tended , I did n\'t know whether to laugh out loud           anything except their editors " drinking problems . " Look , Wellcome , I \'m telling you that I did n\'t have anything to do with - " I began . Then a stray thought struck me . " Could you hold the line a sec ? " Without waiting for his answer , I put down the phone and fetched my copy of WiPP , opening it to the reviews . Something was nagging at me , worrying the corners of my mind . It was a scrap of legendary lore that I \'d acquired years ago , back in college , when Lord of the Rings held all the secrets of the Universe and my holiest desire was to get an elf greased up , buck naked , and ready to rock " n " roll . But when I was n\'t dreaming of more unorthodox uses for pointed ears , I read a lot , everything from trilogies to treatises on myth and folklore . After all , when you just know you \'re going to be the Queen of Elfland ( or at least the Love-Slave           addressing a troll as if he were a dwarf , or calling a boggart a bogle . From out of the mists of those damned embarrassing memories , a graceful white creature stepped . It printed the grass of an emerald meadow with its cloven hooves and knelt beside a tainted fountain . It touched the poisoned waters once with its horn . Once was all it took . The waters bubbled up bright and clean , free of all contamination . Carefully I ran my fingers along the inner spine of the magazine until they encountered the faint trace of stickiness I had been half expecting . No matter how carefully you lick a batter spoon clean , some residual goo will cling to it until it \'s properly washed , and no matter how painstaking you are about getting all the apple filling off a sliver of unicorn \'s horn before you drop it between the pages of your magazine ... " Wellcome , " I said wearily , picking up the phone again , " I confess . I did it . I used my amazing professional           Passion to drop your original reviews and substitute mine , but it was n\'t supposed to happen until the April issue , as a prank . I \'ll be happy to contact them ASAP with a full retraction . Good enough ? Good boy . Good-bye . " I did n\'t wait for him to answer . I hung up the phone but it took a while before I could unclench my hand from the receiver . I stood there for some time , silently cursing the incredible-but-true reason behind the metamorphosis Wellcome \'s vitriloic rants had undergone along with the promise of confidentiality I \'d made to Greta Marie . As if you needed to be sworn to secrecy ! I thought . Outside of Bowman \'s Ridge , who the hell would believe you if you did talk about the unicorns ? I finally got a grip on my emotions and sat down to dinner . I was pleased to see that Rachel had cleaned her plate while I \'d been on the phone with Wellcome . It was n\'t until she \'d scooted upstairs to do her           covering my fish-sticks . I molded a tiny little voodoo doll of Wellcome Fisher out of the surplus squash " drove a fish-stick through its heart , and enjoyed my dinner in peace . Peace is precious because , like chocolate , it never lasts long enough to suit me . Wellcome Fisher took the next bus to Montpelier , rented a car , and showed up at my house the following afternoon , without benefit of invitation . I would have set the dogs on him , but we do n\'t have any dogs and Gorbaduc was n\'t in the mood . His first words to me when he stepped out of the car were , " I do n\'t believe you , you shameless Machiavellian magsman ! " " Fine , thanks , and you ? " I muttered . I have nothing against reality save the fact that there is no way - short of small arms fire , a Doberman , or a dimensional trapdoor - that you can hang up on a face-to-face encounter with a pettyminded twit like Wellcome . " I have here           a clutch of papers at me as he advanced like grim Pedantry " -that prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that your confession is as full of holes as your plots . Behold the galleys of those same reviews which you claim to have removed and replaced ! They are precisely identical to the versions published . " I frowned . " So what \'s the problem ? Of course they \'d be identical . That \'s how galleys work , you know . Who gave you those ? " " They were given to me by the editor of With Pen and Passion approximately three months ago , as is the usual procedure for production of all of my columns . According to my wont , I Faxed back the typographical errors and kept the galleys themselves for my library . The problem , as you so infelicitously put it - " ( Here a needle-toothed leer spread itself over Wellcome \'s face , a grimace for a dyspeptic possum to envy . ) " The problem is that when I filed these galleys they were my reviews           for inspection yesterday , after our delightful conversation , they had somehow become yours . " ( The unicorn bends his head over the polluted stream and touches it once with his horn . The magical powers of purification act immediately , but they ca n\'t distinguish one drop of water from another . Unicorns do n\'t do partial cures or managed care . It \'s all or nothing . ) " Tell me the truth , Barbara , " Wellcome was saying . " Tell me how you managed to accomplish this , short of hiring cat-burglars to infiltrate my domicile . " " I ca n\'t tell you . " " Then perhaps you can tell my attorney . " " You would n\'t believe me and neither would he . " " Faugh ! " ( The man actually said Faugh ! ) " It \'s a long story and parts of it are pretty far-fetched . " " You \'re not scaring me , Barbara ; I \'ve read your Elizabethan series . " I held onto my temper by counting the bristly ginger hairs springing           it were up to me , I \'d tell you straight out , devil take the hindmost . It \'s not . It involves someone else , a respected and respectable person who lives in this town . I \'d like to keep living in this town too , so I \'m not going to tell you dick without this other person \'s permission , and I do n\'t care if you sue my ass off . " " And if this person gives consent ? " Wellcome \'s pudgy lips drew themselves into a moue of anticipation . " Then I \'ll tell you everything . " " Hmph . Very well . Let us be on our way . " He pivoted on one battered loafer and headed for his rental car . When I neglected to come bounding after , he paused and in tones of the highest snittery commanded , " Well , get in . You say the person you must consult likewise lives in this dainty suburb of Ultima Thule ? Fine . You shall play Virgil to my Dante and bring about a           are n\'t worth fighting : Lie down with dogs , get up with fleas , and that includes getting down to word-wrestling with this pedigreed s.o.b . I got into the car and directed him back to the center of town where I led him straight into the coffee shop . " And what do we call this fallen temple of Epicurus ? " Wellcome inquired loudly as we walked through the door . It was past the breakfast rush and before the lunchtime crowd , a few minutes short of eleven , for which I gave thanks . The only witnesses to my mortification were the three waitresses , two young mothers preoccupied with keeping their toddlers from shoving toast into each others " ears , and Muriel . " We do n\'t need to call it anything ; it \'s the town coffee shop , " I gritted . " Ah . How delightfully self-referential . And what unspeakable offense against human society have I committed that entails even temporary incarceration here as my punishment ? " " That \'s what I \'ve always admired about you ,           elegant style . I brought you here because this is where we \'ve got the best chance of meeting the person we \'re after . Now can I buy you a cup of coffee ? " " I \'m assuming a decent cappucino is out of the question . I \'ll settle for a clean cup . " He sniffed , wrinkled up his nose dramatically , and made a great business out of whisking off the immaculate surface of one of the counter stools with his handkerchief . Muriel saw him do this , her expression unreadable . I performed the usual pantomime of those forced to keep company with chowderheads : Sickly smile , shrug of shoulders , silent mouthing of It\'s-not-my-fault . Muriel pressed her lips together and went into the kitchen . While I writhed , our waitress came over and Wellcome asked her what was the ptomaine du jour in a voice so carrying that even the young mothers took note of us . Oh , for a cloak of invisibility ! or even just an Acme anvil to fall from the ceiling and squoosh           I had precious little appetite for anything except a certain critic \'s head on a platter . It was while Wellcome was ingratiating himself with the waitress by staring at her breasts that Greta Marie arrived . My sense of timing had been impeccable : She always made her delivery at around eleven o\'clock . She backed in through the door , an apple pie balanced on either hand , a look of intense concentration on her face . I hailed her by name and she startled like a duchess dry-gulched by a whoopee cushion , then recovered and smiled . It took me a while before I realized that she was n\'t smiling at me . " You \'re Wellcome Fisher ! " she gasped , rushing forward , still bearing pies . I could n\'t say whether her bosom was heaving with the strain of unbridled passion , but the front of her tatty old Navy pea coat was imitating a bellows pretty well . " The flyleaf photo just does n\'t do you justice . Oh my ! Babs never told me that you were one of           simply adored Lady Gwendolyn \'s Gallant ! So rich ! So detailed ! So- " Forty minutes later , I walked myself back home . If Wellcome noticed me leave , he made no demur , and as for Greta Marie , she \'d scarcely noticed my presence to begin with . I left the two of them seated at the counter , gazing deeply into each other \'s eyes , Greta Marie telling Wellcome how wonderful his book was and Wellcome telling Greta Marie that she was so very , very right . That was the last I heard of Wellcome Fisher for weeks thereafter . WiPP made no inquiry into the unique eruption of sweetness and light in Wellcome \'s reviews , and the man himself seemed to have dropped the matter . He also seemed to have become a regular fixture in Bowman \'s Ridge , motoring up whenever he had the time , just to be with Greta Marie . Townsfolk saw them walking hand-in-hand down Main Street , a public display of affection that was the Bowman \'s Ridge equivalent of indulging in the love           . Eyebrows lifted , tongues clicked , and whoever coined the phrase " No fool like an old fool " must \'ve been raking in the residuals for all the times the good Natives muttered those very words under their collective breath . If Greta Marie overheard , she did n\'t care . She was happy . I suppose I should \'ve been happy too . I suppose that as a Romance writer I should \'ve sat back and enjoyed such a picturebook-perfect ending , cue violins and soft-focus fadeout . Unfortunately , just because I write the stuff does n\'t : mean I believe it . My outlook on life would be so much serener if I did . It \'s impossible to enjoy a front row seat for Happily Ever After when you \'re waiting for the other shoe to drop , and if I knew Wellcome , it was going to be a brogan . So I waited , and Thanksgiving came and went . I waited , and the Christmas decorations went up all over town . I waited , and Bobo Riley stuffed two pillows           slapped on a cotton batting beard , and passed out candy canes to all the kids who came into his hardware store with their folks . But as for Greta Marie and Wellcome - Nothing . Not even a rumor of trouble in paradise . It was just too good to be true . Muriel agreed . " I do n\'t know what \'s gotten into the girl , " she said to me . ( In this town you \'re a girl until you become the charge of your husband or the undertaker . ) " She \'s all atwitter , ca n\'t find her head using both hands and a roadmap , most days , and irresponsible - ? I do n\'t like to say how many days she \'s skipped bringing in the pies , and when she does , the quality \'s fallen off something terrible . When I think how good those pies used to be , I could just weep . Not that I \'d ever mention it to her . Poor child would die . On the other hand , she really ought           ? " Which is how I came to be driving up the Old Toll Road to the Bowman place in the snow . I \'d taken the precaution of calling ahead . No way was I going to risk my neck jouncing over ice-filled ruts for nothing . Greta Marie told me how much she \'d be looking forward to my visit , and then : " Dear Babs , So sorry I missed you . Got a call from the postmaster that there \'s a registered letter for me down town from my Wellcome . Let \'s make it another time . Very truly yours , Miss Greta Marie Bowman " I tore the note off the front door and stuffed it in my pocket , then went stomping back to the car , thinking bloody red thoughts . Just as my gloved hand touched the handle , I heard a loud trumpeting sound , the singular , strange , fascinating cry of the unicom . I looked back at the house and saw one come walking around the corner in stately beauty . It was the largest of           contemptuous stare the first time I saw the critters . He \'d changed ; his horn was back , grown almost to full length . It shone with its own pale phosphorescence , a flickering blue-green flame . The beast held his head high and seemed to be in the best of spirits . Maybe animals ca n\'t smile , as we humans understand the grimace , but they do have their ways of letting the world know they \'re happy , and this was definitely one happy unicorn . Was , that is , until he saw it was only me . I could mark the exact moment when recognition struck him right where the horn grew . His feathery tail , once flaunted high as a battle-flag , now drooped with disappointment . His whole demeanor seemed to say , I was expecting someone else . A spark of anger kindled from dashed hopes turned his eyes a dangerous scarlet . How dare I be anyone but the woman he was waiting for ? He lowered that long , razor-edged horn in a manner that made my heart           fast he could run and I knew that there was no chance of my getting inside the car before he reached me . I wondered whether it was going to hurt when he skewered me for the heinous crime of not being Greta Marie . Then his head bent even lower , so low that the tip of his horn came within an inch of the ground . A dull gray film obscured its glorious fire . Sorrow had conquered anger . He let out a little whicker of misery that wrung my heart with pity . I went up to him and threw my arms around his neck , crooning words of comfort . Yes , I talked to him as if he were a despondent collie pup . Yes , I voluntarily brought myself within easy stabbing distance of the horn . Yes , I \'m an idiot , I admit it , it says so on my driver \'s license . If you want proof-positive of my stupidity then consider the fact that I went into writing because I wanted a high-paying , glamorous job where everyone           Thing . But I could n\'t turn my back on the poor creature . " There , there , " I said , running my hands through his flossy mane . " She \'ll be back , you \'ll see . It \'s just that she \'s a little soppy now . Love makes you temporarily brain-dead . " The unicorn looked me in the eye , his gaze eloquent . Do n\'t sugar-coat it , my lady , he seemed to say . You and I both know what love leads to . She may be back , but she wo n\'t be the same , and where are we going to find another virgin at this time of year ? Those Christmas parties are hell on maidenhe , ads . " You mean that Greta Marie and Wellcome have - ? " Curse my imagination ! The very thought of Wellcome al fresco and taking care of business was enough to purge a catfish . My conscious mind immediately tacked up wall-to-wall signs reading Do n\'t Go There , Girlfriend . Do n\'t Buy the Ticket , Do           unicorn flared his nostrils , scorning the whole hideous idea . Ah , true , true : Would he still be hanging around the property if Greta Marie had done the dire deed with Wellcome already ? But to judge by his hangdog expression , he figured it was only a matter of time . " Look , I \'m sorry , but what can I do about it ? " I told him . " Greta Marie \'s happy , . I realize she \'s been neglecting you , but - " The unicorn snorted again and tossed his head , casting off my paltry attempts at consolation . I watched as he picked his way across the farmyard , heading toward the straggle of apple trees . I thought I glimpsed the images of his two companions in the distance , under the spindly shadow of the branches , but that might have been a trick of light on snow . I cupped my hands to my mouth . " Do n\'t give up ! " I called . " Please do n\'t just walk away ! Even           \'s never going to last . Greta Marie \'s not stupid and she \'s not desperate : one day she \'ll see him for the ego-leech he is , unless he slaps her in the face with it first . Tlhat \'s when she \'ll really need you . She \'s been good to you for God knows how many years ; you owe it to her to stick around . Nice unicorns . Good unicorns . Sit ! Stay ! " I was babbling , but it got their attention . Three shimmery streaks of marine light lifted beneath the barren orchard boughs , three pairs of glowing garnet eyes winked at me once before vanishing . I drove back to town alone . Greta Marie was in the coffee shop , seated on one of the stools at the counter nearest the big display window up front , reading her registered letter over a steaming cup of Muriel \'s best brew . It was a wonder she could make out the words for all the stars in her eyes . When she saw me come in , she           Babs , it \'s so wonderful ! I do hope you forgive me for not being at home when you called , but it was such a good thing I came to town and got this letter . Darling Wellcome ! I know he meant to give me a few days " notice , but when one is as significant a figure in the field of belles lettres as he , sometimes it \'s simply impossible to take time for personal matters until the demands of one \'s career have been met . " Belles lettres ? Wellcome ? The only demand ever attached to his career was " Please , please , please , do n\'t write another book ! " As I seated myself on the stool beside hers , I did a rapid mental translation of Greta Marie \'s words , allowing for drift , wind resistance , drag , and converting from the Stupid-in-Love scale . " There \'s something vitally important in there and he did n\'t bother mailing it until the last minute ? " I presumed , nodding at the letter . Muriel           Greta Marie , then looked at me and raised her eyebrows in a manner that said Lost Cause . " Oh , I do n\'t mind , " Greta Marie chirped , pressing the unfolded sheets of spiral notebook paper to her heart . Wellcome might waste words , but never stationery . " He says he \'s coming up today , and that I \'m to meet him here because there \'s no sense in him driving all the way out to my place and then all the way back into town to the travel agent . " She pronounced those last two words as if they \'d been Holy Grail , fraught and freighted with a deeper meaning than was given mere mortals like me to know . " Planning a little trip , hm ? " I asked , striving to keep it casual . " A very special sort of trip , Babs dear . " She blushed . " I do think he \'s coming up to ask me ... to ask me if I would consent to become .. if I would consent to           Wellcome Fisher burst into the coffee shop with the flan of a juggernaut . He shouldered his way between us , nearly shoving me off my stool without so much as a word of greeting . Usually it is a fair treat to be ignored by Wellcome Fisher , but not when it means you \'ve been relegated to the role of superfluous stage-dressing . I was miffed . I got up and moved , taking my cup with me . Wellcome slithered onto the stool I had vacated . He looked Greta Marie up and down , his gaze severe and judgmental . " You \'re not prepared , " he act:used . " Prepared , dear ? " It was sickening to see the way Greta Marie went into mouse-mode at the sound of her master \'s voice . " But -but I \'m here . You did say to meet you here , did n\'t y - ? " " Ye gods , and was that all I said ? " Greta Marie cringed , but she summoned up the gumption to reply , " Well ...           travel agent . " She extended the letter for his inspection and added , " See , darling ? " He rolled his eyes , playing the martyr so broadly that I wondered whether he had a pack of stick-on stigmata hidden in the pocket of his anorak . " Merciful powers above , you \'re a supposedly intelligent wench : Do I have to spell out everything for you , chapter and verse ? Are you that literal-minded ? Are you incapable of basic inference ? " He paused , striking a toplofty pose , apparently waiting for the applause of the multitude . Now mind you , the hour of Wellcome \'s self-styled Calvary was lunchtime and the coffee shop was packed to the gussets with the usual Natives , all of whom knew and respected Greta Marie Bowman .. It was out of this selfsame respect that they went deaf , dumb and blind by common consent . They understood that she had fallen in with this acerbic yahoo of her own free will , they realized that she had brought all her sufferings down upon her           that she should have known better , but damned if they were going to underwrite her humiliation , deserved or not . No one present reacted to Wellcome \'s words with so much as a glance in his general direction . In fact , as far as the good folk of Bowman \'s Ridge were concerned , Wellcome was n\'t even there . They did n\'t just ignore him , they nullified him . Gadfly that he was , Wellcome did not take kindly to being overlooked . The Natives " lack of cooperation irked him . He took a deep breath and brought his fist down on the countertop just as he bellowed , " You peruse , but you do not read . Have you no grasp of subtext ? " Poor Greta Marie . I could see her lips begin to tremble , her eyes to shine with tears that did n\'t spring from joy . " I \'m - I \'m sorry , dear , " she said , her voice all quavery . " I-I suppose you mean I ought to be prepared for -           brow and let his celluloid smile glide across the room . " Finally ! " he informed the audience . They gave no sign that he had spoken . " At the very least , I expected you to be packed . " " Packed ? But-but how could I ? I would n\'t know what to bring . We have n\'t even discussed where we \'ll be going . " His shoulders sagged . Now he was both martyr and victim . " I thought you listened to me , " he complained , wounded to the marrow . " Have n\'t I said time and time again how the winter weather affects my artistic spirit ? Have n\'t I spoken of my very deep , very basic need to follow the sun ? " " You did mention something about visiting your aunt in Tampa every year , but - " " Well , my dear Auntie Clarice has just written to say that she is going off on a holiday cruise this coming week , and that we may have the use of the condo in her           her as if he \'d just laid the crown jewels of Zanzibar at her feet . Greta Marie turned pale . " Oh no , " she said , hands fluttering before her face . " This coming week ? Oh no , it \'s much too soon . I could n\'t possibly make all the arrangements . Reverend Fenster is too taken up with the Christmas season , and we Bowmans have always been married from the Congregational church . Besides , there \'s simply nowhere we could book a large enough hall for the reception , let alone arrange for refreshments , and what about the blood test and the license and my gown and - " Wellcome \'s brows rose and came together until he was glaring at Greta Marie from beneath the shelter of a hairy circumflex . " What the devil are you jawing about ? " he demanded . " Since when does one need a blood test to go to Tampa ? " " Oh , " said Greta Marie softly . She folded her hands above her bosom and repeated , "           a broken stalk . " I thought you meant we were going to be- " she began , then sank into silence . " What ? To be what ? " Wellcome was mystified . For one fleeting moment he seemed rapt by words that were not his own as he attempted to solve this present conundrum . " Do you imply - ? That marriage twaddle you were spouting about your ancestors and the First Congregational Church - ? Surely you were n\'t serious ? " Without waiting for her reply , he dismissed the very possibility with a brief wave of his hand . " No , no , you could n\'t have been ; something else must be nibbling your liver . Spit it out , woman ! I do n\'t indulge in telepathy . " Greta Marie set her hands firmly on the edge of the counter . I swear that I could see the ranks of Bowmans long gone form up in ghostly phalanx behind her and then , one by one , add their ectoplasmic mite to the stiffening of her backbone . By           looked Wellcome in the eye and coldly said , " I thought you were a gentleman . " There could be no greater condemnation uttered by a woman of Greta Marie \'s age and station . For all his failings , Wellcome was not slow on the uptake ; the penny dropped , the " marriage twaddle " that he had dismissed as ridiculous returned to leer at him , nose to nose . I saw the flickering play of emotions over his countenance : shock , comprehension , a smidgen of shame , and then the urgent realization that if he did n\'t act fast , he was in peril of losing face before the one earthly creature he loved above all others . If you think the creature in question was Greta Marie , you have n\'t been paying attention . Frost crackled at the comers of his mouth as he smiled thinly and said , " Well . Here \'s a surprise . Do n\'t tell me that you still cherish orange blossom dreams at your age ? " Greta Marie jerked her head back as if           the core , that much was plain to see , but the old blood bred hardy souls . She drew her mouth into a tight little line and refused to give him the satisfaction of a reply . This sat ill with Wellcome , who would have preferred more concrete evidence that his words had hit the mark . " And I thought we understood each other , " he said , reloading his figurative blowpipe with a freshly venomed dart . " What a sorry disappointment you are . I expected more of you . I believed that you were different , that you were a woman of perception , a woman of spirit , one to whom the petty constraints and empty rituals of society mean nothing so long as she can serve Art . " That did it That was my limit . " Art my ass , " I blurted out . " You just want to get laid . " Wellcome curled his lip at me . " Enter the white knight , " he drawled . " And what concern of yours is this           think you \'d want to encourage your friend to seize the golden opportunity I \'m offering her . Do you honestly believe she \'ll get many more like it on this side of the grave ? If she ever got any before . " " I do n\'t have to sit here and listen to this ! " Greta Marie stood up and started for the door , but Wellcome blocked her escape . " I urge you to reconsider , " he counseled her . " I \'ve always been passably fond of you , you know , especially your good sense . Certainly a woman like you , wise enough to perceive the rich aesthetic contributions of my work to world literature , must also see that I have only your best interests at heart in proposing cette petite af faire . Tampa is lovely at this time of year . Do you want to end your days as a hollow husk , a topshelf virgin whose life will be forever incomplete without so much as the memory of a man \'s attentions ? I \'ll spare you           to be a good girl and- " Greta Marie just gave him a look ; a look that plugged his chatter snugger than jamming a badger in a bunghole ; a disinterested , calculating look such as a farmer might give a stubborn tree stump , mentally debating which was the best crack into which to jam the dynamite . " My ancestor , Captain James Resurrection Bowman , received a grant of land in this town as a reward for his heroism in the Revolutionary War , " she said . " A friend of his received a similar grant , except his was much smaller and located on Manhattan Island . He offered to swap , Captain James chose to decline . In retrospect it was a stupid choice , but it was his own . All my life I have followed Captain James " example ; I have always made my own choices . If I remain a virgin until I marry , it will not be for lack of such ... generous offers as yours , but because that is my decision to make and no           , " Wellcome snarled . Still calm and collected , Greta Marie gave him one short , sharp , effective slap across the face , and it was n\'t a figurative one either , no sirree . And with the echoes of flesh-to-flesh impact still hanging on the air she said , " The only stupid choice I made was loving you . " The incredible happened : The denizens of the coffee shop , to a man , rose to their feet and gave that slap a standing ovation . Bobo Riley from the hardware store was even heard to let out an exultant Yankee whoop that would have put a Rebel yell to shame . That should have been Wellcome \'s cue to leave , making as gracious an exit as he might hope for in the circumstances . Alas , Wellcome had never been a man to read the signs or take the hint . If you told him his writing clunked like a freight train off the rails , he took this to mean that it had the power of a runaway freight instead . He           love me , " he exclaimed triumphantly . " \' Ah , I see your little scheme : You \'re playing hard to get . You \'ve read far too many of the shoddier sort of Romance novels , those dreadful bodice-rippers - " ( Here he looked meaningfully in my direction. ) " - and you want a rough wooing . So be it ! " He was more athletic than his nascent paunch and pasty skin might lead you to believe , fully capable of sweeping a grown woman of Greta Marie \'s size off her feet and out the door before any of us could react . She shrieked in shock , not fear , but she did n\'t struggle as he made off with her . Maybe she thought she \'d already made enough of a scene in the coffee shop to last Bowman \'s Ridge well into the next century . I was the first to address the situation . " Hey ! Are n\'t we going to do something ? " I demanded of my fellow townsmen . No one answered . Most of           as if he wanted to take action , but something was holding him back . " Babs ... " Muriel jerked her head , indicating I was to sit back down at the counter . Dumbly I obeyed in time to hear her whisper , " It \'s not our place to interfere in other folks " domestic quarrels . " " This is an abduction , not a family spat , " I hissed . " If I know Wellcome , he wo n\'t stop until he \'s stuffed Greta Marie into his rental car and driven her all the way to Tampa ! And then what ? She has n\'t got enough cash to come back on her own hook , and would she ever dream of calling anyone up here to send her the busfare home ? " Muriel did n\'t say a word . We both knew the answer : Greta Marie would sooner become a beachcomber or - the horror ! - give Wellcome his wicked way with her before she \'d ask a fellow Native to lend her some money . On the other           outlander like Wellcome Fisher to make off with the last living Bowman than they \'d ever dream of interfering directly in someone else \'s personal matters . " Well , I do n\'t care what the rest of you do , I \'m not going to put up with this ! " I announced and started for the door . A large , work-hardened hand darted in front of me to hold it open . I looked up into Bobo Riley \'s kind blue eyes . " Mind if I walk with you down street a bit , Mrs. Barclay ? " he asked . " I just happen to be going your way . " Within two minutes I found myself transformed into the most popular woman in Bowman \'s Ridge . Simply everyone in the coffee shop was suddenly seized with the simultaneous urge to pay their checks and join me for a little stroll down Main Street . Even Hal abandoned his kitchen and Muriel her place behind the counter , leaving the waitresses and a few stragglers behind to hold down the fort . We were           . We were just going to exercise our Constitutional right to take , well , a constitutional . We followed the faint sound of Greta Marie \'s fists beating a muffled tattoo on Wellcome \'s chest . They had n\'t gotten far . Wellcome had parked his rental about a block away , down by the old war memorial on the green . Our itinerant Town Meeting caught up with him as he was trying to dig out the car keys without letting go of his prize . When he saw us coming his eyes went wide as a constipated owl \'s . He forgot all about the " rough wooing " underway and dropped Greta Marie smack on the town green , then took to his heels . At first I thought that he was running away in fear for his life , that he intended to beat feet all the way to Montpelier , but it turned out that I underestimated him . He fled only as far as the war memorial - a truncated obelisk , its sides inscribed with the names of the Bowman \'s Ridge           , and Viet Nam , its flat top crowned with an urn that the Women \'s Club filled with flowers on appropriate occasions . Spry as a springtime cockroach , he clambered up the monument and perched there , holding onto the lip of the empty urn . " A lynch mob , " he sneered down at us from his perch . " How typical of the rustic mind . Have n\'t you forgotten something ? Pitchforks ? Torches ? You crackerbarrel cretins , how dare you harass me ? A plague on your pitiful frog-fart of a town ! And you - ! " His glittering eyes zeroed in on Greta Marie . Bobo Riley had fallen behind the rest of us in order to help the lady up and now squired her on his arm . " This is all your fault , you squalid excuse for a hicktown Hypatia ! You pathetic pricktease , I \'ll wager you fancy yourself quite the bargain basement Mata Had , do n\'t you ? Do n\'t you ? " " Oh ! " Greta Marie covered her face with           finally drawn blood . She was crying , and in public , too ! Bobo Riley folded his big arms protectively around her and glowered up at : the treed critic , growling threats that failed to stem Wellcome \'s spate of vengeful poison . " Do n\'t cry , darling , " Wellcome crooned sarcastically . " There \'s nothing wrong with you that a good upcountry rogering would n\'t cure . So sad that you \'ll never get it now . Thank God I came to my senses in time . You contemptible dirtfarm Delilah , how a man of my breeding could have ever been mad enough even to consider the sensual enrichment of your dusty , backshelf , remaindered life - ! " Greta Marie threw her head back and howled her misery to the skies . They were on him in the time it takes to blink . We never saw them come ; they were simply there , all three of them , eyes hollyberry bright , horns blazing in the thin winter sunlight . The largest of the three , the one I           to reach him . It set its forefeet on the pediment of the war memorial , paused for an instant to look Wellcome in the eye , then jabbed him straight through the center of the chest with its horn . He fell to the snow-covered green and lay there unmoving . The other two unicorns took it in turns to sniff the body and to snort their disdain . They did not depart as abruptly as they had arrived . The three of them turned as one and trotted up Main Street , tails swishing , in the direction of the town library . One of them paused to munch on a swag of Christmas greenery decking the front of the florist \'s . No one made the slightest move to stay them , and Greta Marie , still weeping in Bobo Riley \'s arms , never once tried to call them back . Wellcome Fisher was dead . We had no illusions of anyone being able to survive a direct thrust to the heart with something as sharp and pointed and long as a uni com \'s horn           until Hal bent over the body and exclaimed , " Hey ! There \'s no hole . " Everyone swarmed around . Hal was right : There was no hole . Not a puncture , not a piercing , not a scratch . No blood stained the snow . There was n\'t even the teensiest rip in Wellcome \'s clothing . The crowd buzzed . I stood apart . I knew what had happened , but darned if I was going to tell my neighbors . They already thought I was weird enough , and if I started explaining about the rules that govern unicorns - ! The unicorn is not a monstrous beast ; it does n\'t kill for sport or spite , it lives to heal , not harm . It bears upon its brow a horn whose touch has the power to purge all poisons and make what is polluted sweet and wholesome once more . The unicorn had n\'t been trying to kill Wellcome , merely to cure him . It had touched his heart with its magical horn , intending to remove only the taint           good and selfless and decent in the man . No one was more surprised than the unicorn by what actually happened . Let \'s just put it this way : It was going to be one hell of an autopsy , one of the starring organs gone without an external clue to explain its vanishment . Oh well , the medical examiner would probably call it a coronary anyway , heart or no heart . Old Doc Barnett hates to make waves . It took a goodly while to sort things out on the green . By the time Chief Dowd and the rest of the local authorities finished taking statements ( " Du n no . He just sorta keeled over . Not a mark on him , see ? " ) and viewing the body , it was getting dark . I looked around for Greta Marie . I figured she should n\'t try to drive herself home after all she \'d been through today . I \'d been anticipated . When I found her , she told me that Bobo Riley had already offered to drive her           several other Natives were within earshot , Bobo went on to say that he \'d pick her up at her place come morning and take her back to town so she could recover her car next day . Then he asked her if she \'d like to help him down at the hardware store by dressing up as Mrs. Claus and giving the kids candy . This was the Bowman \'s Ridge equivalent of him clasping her to his manly chest , raining kisses upon her upturned face , and telling her that he desired her above all women with a raw , unbridled passion that knew no bounds . I do n\'t know if Greta Marie felt all the earth-heaving thrills and collywobbles I put into my books , but her eyes were shining with that special To Be Continued light . I went home . Rachel was waiting for me by the front gate . Something was clearly wrong . Instead of her usual air of carefully cultivated angst and ennui , she was bouncing like a Labrador puppy . " Mom ! Mom ! This is so           do n\'t think he belongs to anyone , and he is soooo gorgeous . I \'ll take care of him myself , I promise , and if there \'s some kind of problem with the zoning geeks I \'ll pay for his board out of my own allowance , honest . Can I keep him ? Can I ? Can I ? Pleeeeease ? " " Keep - ? " The unicorn stepped out of the lengthening shadows , rested his heavy head on my daughter \'s shoulder , and - one Transient to another grinned . This story is respectfully dedicated to the memory of Clifton Webb . \n Inspiration', 'Ancient Mother , I hear you calling .', 'Ancient Mother , I hear your laughter .', 'I played the song over and over , wondering what it was in the simple melody that could move me in such a powerful manner . I thought , " I have to choreograph a dance to this song . "', 'The song " Ancient Mother " came to me at an unsettled period of my life . My husband and I were relocating           because of changes at his office . With this move , I would be separated from my only child for the first time . My daughter was married the spring before we moved to Reno . In addition to leaving my daughter and son-in-law , I was also leaving behind my community of dancers . I had started Thursday in the Dark Dance Theatre , a sacred dance group , the year that I graduated with a bachelor \'s degree in dance from Arizona State University . I nurtured and directed this company of dancers that had grown from four to fourteen within four years . I left the group in the hands of two codirectors as I moved on to further my training in the field of sacred dance . At the same time I had been accepted into the master \'s program in theology in the arts with a focus on dance at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , California . My attendance meant separation from my husband during the school year . I would stay in the dorms during the semester and , on occasion           to visit my husband and my new home . I also began that first semester knowing that within the year I was to become a grandmother . It was a difficult time of transition filled with periods of wonder and excitement over new faces , new friends , and new knowledge .', 'Choreography', 'Once in Berkeley , that first semester came and went in a flourish of papers and dance . Christmas and quality time with husband , in-laws , and daughter were a fading memory as spring semester started amid the rain of the San Francisco Bay Area . It was the first Wednesday of the spring semester back at the Pacific School of Religion . I had made the decision to take a women \'s studies class at           Body : A Feminist Pedagogy . "', 'The cofacilitators then explained the feminist format of the class . Each class would start with a checking-in time where everyone had a chance to speak . After we performed an opening ritual of some type , the rest of the class was up to the students . The facilitators had put together the basic reading list and come up with the topic for each class , but it would be up to the students to lead the discussions and decide what other activities would occur . Each week a pair of students would be responsible           that would be presented on the last day . As they explained the class I became very excited because I was told that my final project could be a dance . It was my goal to work on sketches of dances for my thesis project in any class that I was given the opportunity . Part of the thesis project was to be movement rituals of purification with water and/or fire . By the end of the first class I had decided that my final project would be a water ritual .', 'When I returned to my room I started going through my music . The song " Ancient Mother " seemed perfect for this woman \'s bathing ritual ; it renders the thoughts that a woman may have of her own mother or grandmother as she performs this traditional ritual . " I hear you calling " is the thought of a woman as she unpacks her things           undresses and sees her own body as the same as the other women \'s bodies , she may ruminate , " I hear your song . " As she steps into the water the woman may fancy , " I hear your laughter . " When splashing the water up to her face to wash from her body the impurity of being a woman , she may reflect , " I taste your tears . "', 'Over the next several weeks I continued to refine the dance . In the studio I worked on the timing . Movements were added and perfected . I acquired a jewel -- toned blue tub , a Greek-style white gown , and a jar of sea salts . In order to see what I had done , I brought a video camera into the studio and put the dance on tape . I viewed the tape and saw something beautiful . Yet it felt incomplete . The dance was pretty , but it lacked any transformative elements . From all I had read , I knew that for a ritual to be effective it must be           .', 'A short time after I came to this conclusion about           I read Andy Smith \'s deeply upsetting article " Christian Conquest and the Sexual Colonization of Native Women . " According to Smith , American Indians were seen as " other " by the early colonizers of America , and they were referred to as " dirty beasts , " " savages , " and " devils . " Subjugation of the American Indian was initiated and sustained by a series of events , a primary one being the separation of American Indian families . Beginning in the 1600s , American Indian children were taken from their homes and sent to live , at times for years , in boarding schools , where they often suffered from various forms of abuse , such as rape and molestation , beatings and child labor . Generations of American Indian children were brought up separated from their cultural heritage and from their natural family life . Rampant child abuse on reservations is one of the many repercussions of this separation . Young mothers , Smith argues , have no knowledge of how to raise children ; they were never taught how to deal           by the families they had been separated from for so long.5', 'I thought of a class that I had taken the previous semester on peace rites . In one particular lesson we were asked to work in pairs , supporting each other in a meditation . My partner and I picked the topic of " mercy " for our meditation . When I closed my eyes and let myself sink into a deep state of meditation , I had a vision of the European invasion of America . I           feeling that the " white " consciousness of this generation is ashamed of its history . There is a silence , an unspoken anger and fear , about the Indians in America . I had been filled with compassion for both these peoples ; as a " halfbreed " I had felt the pain of both within me . I came out of that meditation filled with forgiveness and peace . Considering this new dance , I realized that perhaps that vision had been given to me to use . I felt power at being able to be compassionate toward the enemies of my ancestors . Maybe I could draw others into that same compassion and forgiveness for their enemies .', 'Here was a controversial and deeply personal topic : social reconciliation . Never before had I even considered making a dance that attempted to make this kind of social statement . The idea that one person could initiate one culture or society to forgive another culture           seemed unrealistic . And besides , I was not at all sure I wanted to reveal so much about myself . Though I know that art is supposed to be personal , I had gotten away with doing far less personal dances than the one I was contemplating . To do this water ritual , to make a transformative dance using the Native American culture as the base , would mean the risk of exposing my true self and thus possibly being laughed at .', 'I sat in my room contemplating the additional accompaniment to use to create this dance of forgiveness . Music did not seem to be the right choice ; I needed something to help inspire the movement . Poetry-my own poetry ! I had poems that I had written over the years . Some were in the voices of my ancestors while others were written about my ancestors . " Chinook " is in my great -- grandmother \'s voice . " Shotgun Alley " is about a dual that was fought over my grandmother when she was young . " Red Poppies " demonstrates the influences of patriotism and war on my grandmother and myself . In " My Mother \'s Eyes " I tell of my mother \'s loss of her husband to cancer . " I Have n\'t Seen Her in Awhile " is about my perceptions of the repercussions of alcohol . " Untitled " is about hope as I see it today . These poems follow the grieving process as set out           Poppies , " and " My Mother \'s Eyes " are about grieving for what is lost . " Chinook " and " I Have n\'t Seen Her in Awhile " demonstrate anger about loss . Finally , the acceptance of loss would be the water ritual performed to the song " Ancient Mother . " The white bud in the poem " Untitled " signifies the understanding of all that has come to pass and a new aliveness to the future . The above chronological order , I decided , was good for this dance . Then I would place " Ancient Mother " right before the poem " Untitled . "', 'After warming up , I marked off the tight space I would be performing in , only about six by eight feet , and placed the tub in the center of the room . I imagined the audience seated on couches all around the walls , with           as an alter . As the tape played , I started moving . I used the Pueblo step-a step side , step together with a bounce in the knees-to take me to the altar . I went with my back to the imagined audience so that they would see the clan symbols on my dance blanket . This would be the introduction of myself . At the altar , I turned to face the center and continued the Pueblo step , completing a circle . Because I wanted the audience to hear the words of my poems I minimized movement so as not to distract them . As the second poem , " Shotgun Alley , " started I went into a deep knee bend , a male movement . Making sharp poking gestures with my hands I quickly turned , keeping the beat , moving deep and fast . When I was directly in front of an imaginary person seated against the wall , I wobbled my head to and fro , again a man \'s gesture . As " Shotgun Alley " drew to a close , I           a movement that is like the waves on the ocean , moving forward and backward from the hips . Next came the poem of grieving . I took off my blanket , folded it , and placed it on the altar . I lit a candle as a gesture of remembrance , then I took a rose and walked slowly around the room stripping rose petals and dropping them to the floor . After placing the naked flower on the altar , I proceeded to take off a layer of clothes , and let down my hair . Clothed in a white gown over a white slip , I finished the poetry section . I moved into the bathing ritual as the music for " Ancient Mother " started . As I stepped out of the tub I picked up a white blanket , representing hope for future generations , from the floor . I wrapped the blanket around my shoulders as the poem " Untitled " was read .', 'out of', 'a', 'bud bounces', '          placing the tape recorder on my desk when I saw something out of the corner of my eye : Outside the window a deer was standing and watching me . I walked closer to the window and the deer just stood there . We stared at each other for a long time until she finally walked off , down the hill toward the city . Maybe the deer was there , maybe she was a spirit helper , or maybe she was both . For me the deer represents peace . In the Yaqui culture the deer is surrounded by flowers in a rainbow-colored heavenly place of peace . In the Tlingit culture the Deer Ceremony is another name for the Peace Ceremony that is performed at the closure of a fight between clans . Seeing the deer confirmed my decision to choreograph this dance of forgiveness and peace .', 'Choosing a title is always difficult . Not only should it have meaning for me , but it should also be understandable to others . For the title of this dance I went back a           my mother \'s village , Sitka , learning the dances of my clan from the elder , Daasdiya . Songs and dances belong to clans or families . I was allowed to learn only my own family songs and dances . But an elder of another clan can also give you their songs and dances . Daasdiya is from the Coho clan while I am from the Sea Pigeon clan . She gave me a dance called the " Raven Peace , " which is a peace-making dance . Wars and feuds between clans were common and could last for generations ; insults and wounds of conflict needed healing . The Peace Ceremony , otherwise known as the Deer Ceremony , was a first step in healing community . " Raven Peace " is done in the Peace Ceremonies and is one of the few peace dances that has survived in the Tlingit culture to this day .', 'The soloist in this dance represents the Raven . He/she wears a raven-shaped hat and hops , struts , and rolls his/her eyes at the audience . The Raven is a clown and is trying to make the audience laugh . In the song and dance , Raven is a symbol of the clan singing the song and the Wolf the other clan ; they poke fun at their own arrogance by walking about clumsily as a raven does . At the end of the song , Raven is said to be " walking toward his Wolf . " I chose these words as my title in order for this dance to highlight its peace-making element and its focus on the healing of relationships . The dance is a call for peace and healing to occur between the descendants of the American Indians and those of the many peoples that have settled on this land called America .', 'Final Thoughts', 'Shotgun Alley I', 'the turn of the century', 'black and copper , guns', 'go to the islands', 'gone to Shotgun Alley', 'and sea pigeons cry ,           out , run sideways', 'claws clicking in the silence', 'colored haze of sunrise in the old west', 'the copper-skinned women sway', 'at their breasts they sway', 'back and forth to put away the sorrow', 'as the old women watch , the son', 'Raven calls through the trees', 'I turn the wheel and follow the afternoon light across the pavement .

A year later , he sent a postcard to my parents -- the postcard came from somewhere improbable , like Iceland or Jersey -- asking whether we might all spend Christmas together , which we did . He came with a woman , a war photographer who was , I think , Czech . We played Christmas games , we laughed a lot , he teased my mother about buying all the           of us there was the same complicity . Neither of us looked away or took the slightest step back . We felt the same love : simply the circumstances had changed . The passeur had delivered his charge ; the frontiers were crossed .', "Instead , I made believe that he would come back to Europe . To which he replied , The best thing there , John , down under , is the grass ! There 's no grass as green anywhere else in the world . He said this forty years ago . I never knew exactly when or how           the stolen hair dryers , the honey cake with candied orange peel , Jagusia with her basket now almost empty , the black cherries that have to be sold and eaten quickly because they wo n't last , the barrel of salted herring , the voice of Ewa Demarczyk on a CD , singing one of her defiant songs , I suffer his death for the first time .", 'When I arrive , a man turns toward me and , as if guessing my distress -- is there another country in the world more habitually accustomed to coming to terms with that emotion ? -- he hands me , without smiling , the carrier pigeon he is holding .', 'I left the Plac Nowy , and found , after asking two passersby , the bank machine . From there I returned to the pension in Miodowa Street and lay down on the bed . It was very hot , hot with the uncertain heat of the eastern plains . Now I could weep . I shut my eyes and imagined shuffling a pack of cards .', 'Many , many years ago , the Possum had a long , bushy tail . He was so proud of it that he combed it every morning . He sang about it whenever the animals held a dance . The Rabbit , who had no tail since the Bear pulled it out , became very jealous . She made up her mind to play a trick on the Possum .', '" I have such a handsome tail , " he said . " I ought to sit where everybody can see me . "', 'The Rabbit immediately went off to see the Cricket . Now , the Cricket was such an expert hair cutter , the Indians called him " the barber " . The Rabbit told the Cricket to go the next morning and get Possum \'s tail ready for the dance . She told the Cricket exactly what to do .', "This pleased the Possum very much . He stretched himself out and shut his eyes . The Cricket began to work on the Possum 's tail . First he carefully combed it . Then he quietly began to clip the Possum 's hair close to the roots ! As he clipped the Cricket wrapped red ribbon around the tail to hold the loose hair in place . The Possum , eyes tightly shut , did n't know what the Cricket was           to the hall where the dance was to be held . There he found the best seat was ready for him , just as the Rabbit had promised . When the Possum 's turn came to dance , he stepped into the middle of the floor , grinning from ear to ear .", 'The animals shouted more loudly than before . The Possum was delighted . Now to really show off his fur , he untied the ribbon . Then around and around he danced singing , " See how fine is the fur on my tail ! "', "That is why the Possum 's tail is bare and why he plays dead when taken by surprise .", '2021 My deathday is July 18th . I spent it this year as I have every year for the past ten : at home in bed , with my wife nearby . I ca n\'t afford a private doctor , and I \'ve heard too many iatrogenic horror stories to check into the hospital for the day . So I just lay quietly , imagining all of the different ways it could happen . A sudden squeezing pain in my chest ? Or maybe a jackhammer headache , announcing a burst blood vessel in my brain . A cold , air-conditioned breeze blew over my face , chilling the sweat on my forehead . Around sundown my legs started to tremble uncontrollably , so I pulled the covers up to my neck . Knowing the day on which I will die , but not the year , sometimes seems worse than knowing nothing at all . When midnight rolled around , I heaved myself up onto the edge of the bed and felt my fear slowly ebbing           my wife , and we celebrated with some cheap champagne . It was one of those sultry nights we occasionally get in Chicago in the summer , but the humid warmth felt oddly comforting . I glanced up at the stars and saw the distortion field of the Chtarri ship slip silently overhead . A dirty finger wiping the dome of the sky , smearing out the stars as it passed in front of them . The Angel of Death , erasing stars , erasing lives . I shook these morbid thoughts from my head . No need to worry for another year . Like most data miners , I got paid strictly on contract , so I was back at my desk early the next morning , looking for work . I pulled up several prospective jobs on my screen , along with my AI \'s estimate of the payoff probabilities . Most of these were the usual narrow bell curves , centered on depressingly small amounts of money , but one of them was blank , with a note attached : " Bill , are you still in           . Bob Field . " I had n\'t seen Bob since he \'d joined the Chtarri Institute . Odd that he was n\'t going in-house for the job . And he wanted a face-to-face . But I could n\'t afford to be picky . The Chtarri Institute huddled among the remains of a defunct particle accelerator out in the western suburbs . Long prairie grass had reclaimed most of the lab , although I could make out the circular scar of the accelerator ring on a slight plateau next to the road . The Institute occupied the central high-rise building , a curved , concrete monolith looming above the Illinois plains like a modern Stonehenge . Bob was still in a meeting when I arrived , so his secretary shunted me into the Visitor \'s Center . Photos of the Chtarri ship covered the walls of the cramped room . These must have been taken by unmanned probes , but even from space the distortion field masked the faint reddish blob of the ship . Against one wall , a video about the Chtarri played in an endless loop .           studied the photos , but it was a collection of the same recycled facts that I \'d heard dozens of times before : " . . . seems to be a localized , intense gravitational field , violating General Relativity . . . " , " . . . following the disastrous Chinese manned expedition of 2013 .. . " In one photo , the ship resembled a cylinder pinched at the waist ; in another , it looked more like a slightly deformed sphere . " . . . obviously do not experience time in the conventional way . . . , " . . . toward understanding the riddle of the Chtarri . " A computer reconstruction of the true shape of the Chtarri vessel , carved in Lucite , hung suspended from a wire in the center of the room . The contorted model was knotted like something out of a topologist \'s nightmare . After ten minutes pondering " the riddle of the Chtarri " , I was ushered into Bob \'s office . Bright summer sunlight flooded through a floor-to-ceiling window , illuminating a sparsely-populated           across the room to pump my hand . " What have you been up to ? " he asked . " Oh , the usual freelance jobs . Lots of work , and not much money . " I studied the name plate on his desk . " I see you \'ve made it to the exalted position of Assistant Director for Internal Affairs \' . " " Indeed I have . And I think I could get you a full-time job out here when you get tired of freelancing . " " You know I do n\'t much like the Chtarri . " Bob shrugged . " Some people hate the Chtarri and some people worship them . I do n\'t think either attitude is very reasonable . Let me show you something . " Bob flicked a wall switch , and I heard the familiar words : " Chtar ri chol fung pyon luk chin . . . " It sounded like a demented version of Korean played at 1/10 speed . " You \'ve heard the first part of thiswe all have , " Bob said ,           and 22 minutes . That \'s the first thing we heard from the Chtarri ship when they took up orbit twelve years ago . Then they immediately began broadcasting the deathday information in binary , which they \'ve continued doing , without interruption , for the past twelve years . " Bob turned off the recording . " Thirteen hours of gibberish . That \'s the sum total of everything we know about Chtarri , and we \'ve never been able to decipher it . " " Have you tried playing it backwards ? " " Very funny . Actually , we have . As well as every other permutation . Our linguists have spent the past decade knocking their heads against it , with nothing to show for their efforts . And the Chtarri have remained in the exact same orbit , ignoring all of our attempts to communicate . " " Not exactly friendly , are they ? " " I \'m not sure that has any meaning when applied to the Chtarri . " Bob strode back to his desk and settled into his chair . "           do they broadcast the deathday information ? Hell , how do they know the day on which we \'re all going to die ? And why do they send everyone \'s month and day of death , but not the year ? Is it because they do n\'t know the year , or are they just withholding it for some inscrutable reason ? I know I \'m going to die on June 22 , d , but it does n\'t do me much good if I do n\'t know the year " " But you take precautions on your deathday . " " Sure , everyone does , except for the few people who decide that they \'d rather not know their deathday . " Bob drummed his fingers on his desk . " Let\'s. get down to business . You said you \'d be willing to take this job on a contract basis , so here \'s what we \'re looking for . We \'ve had three suicides at the Institute in the past three months . " Actual , or presumed ? " " Two actual , and           paper on his desk . " Leonard Kosnik , Philip Chuang , and jason Krauss . Chuang and Krauss are the actual suicides : both killed playing Russian roulette , apparently simultaneously . The third case is presumed : Kosnik was driving here to work on his deathday and was killed in a car crash . We do n\'t allow our employees to work on their deathdays , much less encourage it . He must have been crazy to take such a risk . " I found myself nodding . " And what do you need me for ? " " Two of the three guys left notes . Not exactly suicide notes , but I need to track down what they mean . The first one was from our crash victim , Kosnik ; it just says " I am you \' . The second , from Chuang , is a date his wife found on a scrap of paper in his desk drawer at home : November 12 , 2122 \' . " " That \'s more than a hundred years from now . " " Yes ,           these notes means . " " And you want me to find out . " Exactly . " " But why are you going outside of the Institute at all ? You must employ hundreds of data miners . " " Slightly fewer than a hundred . The problem is that they all work in S Division , which also employed all three of the suicides . Frankly , I \'m having trouble getting much cooperation from S Division . I think they \'re hiding something . I wanted to bring in someone from the outside , someone I could trust . " " S Division ? What \'s that ? " " Statistical analysis . " Bob fumbled under his desk and brought up a display on the wall . I squinted to make out the milky diagrams against the bright sunlight streaming through the window . Bob pointed at a blurry red dot orbiting the blue globe of the Earth . Stylized radio waves connected the ship to a set of radar dishes scattered over the globe . " The Chtarri datastream actually arrives in two separate pieces           a transmission for each individual shortly after birth . The higher frequency datastream contains the time and latitude-longitude of the birth , which we can correlate with the individual newborn . The lower frequency stream contains the actual deathday . Both streams are encrypted at the receiver and sent here , where we correlate them without decryption and store the information and the decryption key for the parents . " He turned off the display . " But what most people do n\'t realize is that we decrypt the deathday information separately and use it for statistical analysis . " I had heard rumors of this , but I was still surprised . I turned to stare at Bob . " You actually look at the deathdays ? " " Only in a statistical sense . We do n\'t know which days correspond to which individuals , so there \'s no loss of privacy . " He began tapping a pencil on his desk . " And we never release the raw data to the public . " More tapping . " Anyway , data security around here is about           \'re completely compartmentalized . We \'ve got firewalls inside of firewalls . Hell , I do n\'t have access to half the information that flows through here . That \'s why I need your help . " But what \'s the point of collecting the deathday information at all ? " " We \'re hoping to learn something we can use . For instance , a sharp rise in winter deathdays might indicate a big flu epidemic coming . We would n\'t know the year , of course , but we could use influenza mortality as a function of age to make a rough guess . Unfortunately , nothing much has ever come of this . " Our conversation drifted into less and less relevant areas , and I was impatient to get started , so I excused myself . Bob cleared his throat . " Bill , there \'s one other thing you need to know . Chuang and Krauss-the guys who died playing Russian roulette-according to their friends , they did n\'t die on their deathdays . " " So they lied about their actual deathdays . Happens           . But it \'s a strange coincidence that both of them would have lied . Just keep this quiet . People depend on the accuracy of the deathday information to plan their lives . We do n\'t want to start a panic . " The drive back home would take almost an hour , so I decided to hunt down a cave in the local area . I found a well-equipped one in Batavia , just outside the Institute . The operator on duty took my personal information and gave me a cursory glance . " Booth 6 , " he said . " You need to pay in advance if you want more than half an hour " I gave him my card ; no telling how long this would take . I sealed the booth shut and powered up the connection to the Skein . Nodes began to glow in the dark , connected by a tangled coil of multicolored curves . I was relieved to see that this cave used the standard symbology : green curves for AI-generated threads ( reliable , but often useless ) ,           possible ) and red for threads of unknown origin ( danger ! Why conceal the origin of a thread ? ) . I started to craft a node to plant in the Skein . This was the true art of a data miner : specifying the node precisely enough to get useful information , but broadly enough to attract the occasional wild-card thread that might hold the answer . I began with the easier job of parsing the date . Time > month November ) ANDTime > day 12 ) AND ( Time > year 2122 . Pretty straightforward . The cave displayed my node as a calendar , with the date circled . Cute . Then I began work on the cryptic sentence . A spider drifted past my face weaving a green web of threads . I waved , and the spider waved back with its two forelegs . Back to the sentence . Person > I : possible specific Kosnik OR possible generic ) AND ( Action > am : possible existence OR possible equivalence OR possible identity ) AND ( Person > you : possible generic           English sentences were still the hardest things to code . Within seconds , spiders swarmed around both of my nodes , weaving their tangled green threads . I traced the threads from the date first , since that seemed more promising . Bundles of threads ran straight into reference engines . Not surprising . I activated one of the engines to see what it would spit out : " November 12 , 2122 : 204th " anniversary of the founding of the Austrian Republic . " " November 12 , 2122 : 178th anniversary of the sinking of the Tirpitz . " " November 12 , 2122 : 141st anniversary of the first balloon crossing of the Pacific Ocean . " " November 12 , 2122 , 113th anniversary of the outbreak of the Golan War . " The list droned on and on , an ocean of information , but nothing I could use . I checked my second node . Multiple threads splayed out in all directions , but a cluster of them converged on the same node . It was shaped like a church , but a           top-the Church of the Feyn . I reset the node , adding a specifier ANDOrganization > Church of the Feyn ) . Most of the threads vanished , and I traced one to a reference engine : " I am you- one of the eight sacred sayings of the Church of the Feyn . " So Kosnik was one of the Feyn Men . I did n\'t have much use for the various bizarre cults which had sprung up in the wake of the Chtarri incursion , but this was my only lead , so I could n\'t afford to ignore it . I love the old Eastern European neighborhoods in Chicago . The summer heat had relented a bit , so I decided to park a few blocks away and walk . A row of identical squat brick houses stretched out before me , each one nestled behind a narrow , neatly-trimmed front lawn . Tree-filtered sunlight dappled the sidewalk . A few old people sat on their front porches watching the world go by . I glimpsed some names on the mailboxes : Velius and Gimbutus and Daukantas           indistinguishable from any of the other houses , except for an unobtrusive Feynman diagram engraved on the door . The door opened to reveal the figure of George Labokas , a middle-aged guy in a white shirt and dark pants , starting to get bald on top and fat around the middle . Not exactly my idea of a cult leader . Labokas led me to an office at the rear of the house . " Can I offer you something to drink ? " he asked . " No thanks , " I answered . " I really do n\'t have much time . " Labokas settled into a maroon leather armchair , and motioned me toward an identical one . I glanced around the room . Aside from a few stylized Feynman diagrams on the wood-panelled walls , there was nothing to mark this room as a Feyn sanctuary . " Well , what can I do for you ? " Labokas asked . " You were rather vague on the phone . " " I \'ve come to ask about one of your members , a Mr.           was an apostate . " " A what ? " " An apostate . He left our church over a year ago . " " Len Kosnik is dead . And he left a note behind , which said , " I am you \' . " Labokas smiled . " He was obviously reaffirming his devotion to our philosophy . A pity that he died before I had a chance to talk to him . How did it happen ? " " An automobile accident . He drove to work on his deathday and was killed in a crash . We \'re considering it a case of presumed suicide . " " Ridiculous ! Did he jump off a bridge ? Did he shoot himself in the head ? No , he just went for a car trip- " " -on his deathday . " " Kosnik obviously had decided to rejoin our church . And Feyn Men do not kill themselves . " " But you guys believe in reincarnation , so suicide would n\'t be such a big deal , would it ? " " We believe           kind of reincarnation . " Labokas leaned forward and put his fingertips together . " Do you know why all of the electrons in the universe have the same mass ? " " No . I \'m not a scientist . " " Richard Feynman showed that there really is only a single electron in the universe . It travels back and forth in time , manifesting itself as an electron or an anti-election , eventually occupying the place of all of the electrons in the universe . In the same way , there is only one human soul , which travels back and forth in time , eventually animating all human beings . Just like the electron in a Feynman diagram . We \'re all the same person . Eventually you will get to experience every human life which has ever existed or ever will exist . " " So if you were stuck in a bad existence , why not end it and start over ? Seems pretty reasonable to me . " Labokas pursed his lips , and his speech became clipped . " There is only           it . No one may take it upon himself to shorten it . I do n\'t see how I can make myself any clearer . " I decided to change the subject . " Does the date November 12 , 2122 , mean anything to you ? " Labokas leaned back in his armchair . " November 12 ? Is n\'t that Veteran \'s Day ? No wait , that \'s November 11 . November 12 does n\'t ring a bell . It certainly has no special significance in our Church . " " Well , thanks for your time . I \'d better be going . " I stood and tried to edge past Labokas . " Would you like some more information on the Church of the Feyn ? " Labokas planted himself between me and the door . I grudgingly accepted a few pamphlets . Having paid my " fee " for this visit , I turned to leave . Labokas extended his hand , palm upwards . " I am you . " I very much doubt it . " I got permission from Bob to           I pulled up his scratchpad for the day before his death . Meaningless sentences filled the screen : " I am you . " " We are you . " " They are us . " Kosnik seemed like a pretty disturbed guy . An audio file was attached to the scratchpad . I activated it , and it spewed out , " Chtar ri chol fung pyon . . . " Kosnik had the entire 13-hour transmission hidden on his machine , and it appeared that he had been trying to decipher it . Definitely not part of his job description . I forwarded a progress report to Bob and then spent the next two weeks learning more than I ever wanted to know about the historical trivia associated with November 12th : " Venera 2 space probe launched " , " Yuri Andropov succeeds Leonid Brezhnev " , " Formation of the Baltic Union " . I was getting nowhere , and I wanted to wrap things up by the end of August . My wife \'s deathday was coming up in mid-September , and I always tried           spend some time together , just in case . My break finally came on August 10th . As usual , I stopped into the cave near my house to see if the spiders had made any further progress on my calendar . More useless green threads connected to dozens of items of historical minutiae , but I made out a single red thread , trailing away beyond my visual horizon . I traced it to a private node , a white box with no distinguishing features . It was sealed up tight . I pinged the box . A few seconds later , the box sent back a short blip : " Meet me tomorrow , 9 a.m. , 63rd and Cottage Grove . Green dress . " The El rumbled overhead as I cruised down 63rd Street . The South Side was frightening even in broad daylight . I knew I would n\'t die that day , but nothing prevented my being beaten , robbed , or shot . I spotted a wispy woman in a green dress clutching a small briefcase and glancing furtively up and down the           " Get in , quick , " I said . " Have you just been lounging around out here ? Do you know how dangerous this neighborhood is ? " She slid into the front seat , brushed back her stringy black hair , and glared at me . " Of course I know how dangerous it is . I just got off the El . You \'re five minutes late . " She turned and glanced out the rear window . " I wanted to make sure nobody saw us together . Take us somewhere private where we can talk . " I pulled onto Lake Shore Drive and headed north . " Who are you ? " I asked . " I \'m not going to tell you my name . I could lose my job if anyone finds out about this . " " Do n\'t worry , I do n\'t have to reveal my sources . That \'s not part of my contract . " " I worked with Jason Krauss . He was my friend . " She wiped something from her eye . "           have killed himself . " I pulled into the parking garage at the Museum of Science and Industry . " Nobody will see us here . What do you want to tell me ? " " It was Kosnik \'s fault . He persuaded Jason and that other guy . . . " " Chuang ? " Yes , Chuang . Kosnik convinced them to take part in some kind of crazy experiment . And Jason ended up dead . " She began to cry softly . " Kosnik was nuts . He told me once that he had cracked the Chtarri message . " " Did Krauss believe him ? " " I do n\'t know . " She pulled a sheaf of papers from her briefcase and fanned them out on the dashboard . " Kosnik and Jason were both obsessed with this , but they never told me why . These are graphs of the total deathdays for everyone born in the last eight years . Here \'s the first one , for children born in 2013 . Those kids are all eight years old now .           die on January 1st , the second point gives the number who will die on January 2nd , all the way through to December 31st . " The graph was just a flat line with the expected small bumps and wiggles . White noise . The woman pulled up the second sheet . " Now look at this one . It \'s for kids born a year later , in 2014 . See anything strange ? " In the second graph , a small bump rose above the straight line . " That looks like a rise in deathdays for a particular day . " " That particular day " happens to be November 12th , the day you \'re interested in . Now look at the third one . " She proceeded to show me all eight graphs , and the bump got larger in each , until in the final graph , it was a sharp spike towering over all of the other dates . " Look at this , " she said . " Almost 1/50 of the children born last year are destined to die on           " But what does that mean ? " " I have no idea . But it really bothered Jason . He made these copies for me and told me to hold onto them in case anything happened to him . " She sobbed . " You can keep them ; I do n\'t want anything more to do with this . " She shoved open the car door . " Wait , I have some more questions . " " I told you everything I know . Figure it out yourself . That \'s what you \'re getting paid for . " She slammed the door and ran away into the bowels of the garage . Why were increasing numbers of children destined to die on November 12th ? I entered the deathday data into my computer by hand , and then wandered into the kitchen to get some coffee and think . Something nagged at the back of my mind . What was it that Bob had said about flu epidemics ? I jumped up , spilling some of my coffee on the kitchen table , and ran back           tables . Suddenly I felt a cold chill creep up my spine . I ran a cross-correlation , with an extrapolation of current lifespan trends . The answer popped onto my screen , stark and implacable : a death sentence for us all . And in my cold terror , I understood what Kosnik and Chuang and Krauss had done . Bob dropped my final report onto his desk ; it landed with a dull thud . " I do n\'t get it , " he said . " You claim that the number of newborns with a November 12th deathday has been increasing every year . What does that mean ? And what does it have to do with November 12 , 2122 ? " I paused for a few seconds to collect my thoughts . " It turns out that November 12 , 2122 will be a very special day in human history . " I leaned back in my chair . " It \'s the end of the world . " Bob smiled . " Come on , Bill , stop kidding around . " " I           \'ll happen . Nuclear war ? Bioterrorism ? Maybe even an asteroid strike . All I know is that on November 12 , 2122 , everyone living on the planet will die . Bob \'s smile vanished . " That \'s just crazy . What makes you think that ? " " It \'s the pattern of the deathdays . Think about it . Kids born four or five years ago will be 105 or 106 when the year 2122 rolls around . Not many of them will make it that far , but a few will , and those lucky few will all die at the same time on November 12 , 2122 . That \'s what gives the small bump in the deathday graph . And what about the kids born last year ? They \'ll only be 102 when the missiles fly or the meteor strikes . I checked the mortality tables ; a child born today has almost a 2% chance of living to 102 . And all of that 2% are going to die together on November 12 , 2122 . That \'s what gives           " I do n\'t believe you . " " Just wait and see . The signal will get stronger every year . A child born ten years from now will only have to make it to 90 to see the end of the world . More than a quarter of the population can expect to live that long . How are you going to hide it from the general public when one-fourth of the newborns have a November 12th deathday ? " Bob stared at my report , then looked back up at me without saying a word . I stood and leaned over his desk . " It \'s obvious that Krauss and Chuang and Kosnik reached the same conclusions , " I said . " And that \'s why they committed suicide ? " I gazed past Bob out of the window , out over the prairie grass rippling in the wind . " We \'re all prisoners of fate , doomed to die on our deathdays . But I believe that the Chtarri message contains the key to getting out of that prison . Kosnik really did           to evade the predicted deathdays . But he needed some volunteers to test his theory . So he recruited Chuang and Krauss to see if it would be possible for them to die on a day other than their deathdays . They knew what was at stake . Maybe they were willing to sacrifice their lives to prove that the end of the world could be evaded . Or more likely they did n\'t really believe in their guts that it would be possible to die on the wrong day . We \'ll never know . But their deaths show that Kosnik was right . The end predicted by the deathday data is not inevitable . " Bob shook his head . " Nonsense . Kosnik was a statistician . How could he succeed in translating the Chtarri message where all of our linguists have failed ? " " Because Kosnik figured out who the Chtarri are and where they come from . " I am you . " They are us . " Kosnik was n\'t planning to rejoin the Feyn Men , but their ideas gave him the           are us . Our descendents , from a thousand millennia in the future , evolved beyond recognition , evolved into creatures so alien that mutual communication is impossible . And their very existence means that the end of the world is not inevitable . We can find a way to evade our deathdays if we can crack their message . 2026 My deathday was July 18th . I spent it this year as I have every year for the past three : boating on Lake Michigan . Of course , like everyone else , I have no idea now of the day on which I will actually die . Does this mean that the world wo n\'t end on Nov. 12th , 2122 , after all ? I do n\'t know ; that \'s a question for the scientists and philosophers . What I do know is that I will die on a random day in a random year , known only to God . And that \'s just fine with me. \n She just knew that Matt was n\'t capable of doing anything so horrible .', 'This week , my mom brought doughnuts covered in powdered sugar .

She was a young thing with plenty of lipstick and moxie and obvious experience . Mario was proud of his new discovery and the two were unabashedly intimate . Where he finds them I do n't know . There are bars in all the hamlets near here and my father drives around a lot at night . Then to top this he brings home his new boyfriend . You see , he visits all sorts of bars . This one at least was closer to Mario 's age . He was very unpretentious , very sweet . I liked him right off . In recent years my father has shown better taste in men than in women . All this happened in the same week , and you would think it was a pretty bad week for my mother . Surprisingly , she took it in stride .

But getting back to my father : when he brought his two new friends by he was showing his true colors , though I did n't realize it at the time . I saw instead the colors           his deceptive charm . At least Mario keeps his eclectic tastes more or less private , otherwise the town would talk , though not as much as you might think ; peculiar is normal around here and I know a few families almost as strange as ours .

They all know exactly what they want . They want to get into acting . When one of the new ones panics and wants out , Sophie finds a way to misplace her contract . Occasionally she \'ll mix in a little religion and talk to the girls about Jesus , and every so often one of them turns out to be on good terms with the Lord . " God gave me this body and I sure ai n\'t           heard one of them say , to which my mother answered , " Amen to that , child .

You would n't call me a believer exactly , but I 'm not quite an atheist either . I think God is an interesting hypothesis and a handy place to put the blame for things you ca n't explain any other way .

She 's one of these kids with a bunch of problems , any one of which would be devastating by itself . One           she 's balding from the forehead back , which makes her head look oversized -- and then there 's the cleft lip . There are other things about the way she moves , the way she talks . She seems to be friendless . I found out her name is Tara . When Tara 's got money she buys a strawberry parfait and eats it with difficulty , yet delicately , relishing her treat even more than the other kids . I really pile the sauce on , her favorite part -- Lance and his rules be damned . I want to talk to this unfortunate child , but I do n't dare ; nearby is an unsmiling woman I assume is the mother , who thinks God-knows-what about the strange man in the ice cream truck .

Well , I looked around , as if Lance had spies in the bushes ; and I looked at the overflowing change drawer ; and I reasoned that we \'d all done well enough today that a little bit of the product would n\'t be missed . Without hesitating I made up the most elaborate parfait I could , a real frilly job that looked as good as the pictures , and held it out so she could see it . But Tara shook her head no . She must have thought she was expected to pay for it . So , full of warm feeling and without thinking , I yelled out " Free ! "', "I did what any sane ice cream vendor would do in the face of a mob . I retreated to the cab and raced the motor , and when that did n't clear a path I jangled the bells . Eventually , to break free , I had to inch the truck forward into the children , who parted reluctantly , shouting in mock anger ( or real anger ) and banging the sides so the vehicle rocked . Driving off I glimpsed Tara , limping slowly away from the crowd . Later I cleaned up the strawberry parfait , which in the commotion had fallen from the ledge and looked like a bloody mess on the floor .

He told me about some graduate programs in social work and offered to write a recommendation . And I might just take him up on it ; between Father Lansing and my alma mater getting in would be a cinch . The talk turned theological and in the beginning he declined to accept my agnosticism ; he was a priest , after all . But           confessed to wondering occasionally if my position was a defensible one . " We leave the proselytizing to people like your mother , " he said , and we both laughed . There were a few more harmless jokes at Sophie \'s expense before I realized I was looking forward to telling her about the evening ( except for the brandy and a few other omissions ) .', 'I caught the two of them the other day doing something surprising , although they may have been at it in secret for years . I found them in the kitchen together having coffee . If I \'m not mistaken my father was wiping away tears ; beneath the careless charm he \'s as vulnerable as the rest of us . The surprising thing is he goes to Sophie when he \'s down . Afterwards she said to me , " He \'s the devil , that man is , " and continued ironing one of his gaudy floral shirts -- taking special care around the pockets and collar .', "Mario is naturally very interested in her and hovers about , coy and shameless .

The strange smooth buildings , rising either side , with their pointed windows that had the shape of fingers , ended frequently in shattered tops , where the bombardment had hit them all those years ago . And obviously , there was nobody anymore to light a lamp . From the valley , if one was unaware , the City could pass           done so often , our Source had assured us . You had to know , and have a map . And then there was the climb . But Hassent and I were used to climbs .

And in the intimacy post-received pleasure and alcohol , I had let slip to Hassent my doubt about the magics of this place -- whether they were truly finished . But Hassent had only said , " All gone . All that \'s left in the City is treasure beyond the dreams of insanity . That \'s why we \'re going . And it \'s a bit late to coward out .

The Thesaury of the City . The bombs had never reached it , even all the way down here , where , if they fell , as we had already seen , they had always caused maximum destruction . I thought of the war-balloons gliding over , the deadly copper wires strung out , and the impacted electric charges descending - lovely as fireworks - each an induced lightning -- strike . Once , I had had the dubious delight , in the course of my job as a thief , of pretending to be a server at an orgy arranged for some military general . I recall his holding forth on the efficiency of           Xos . They have been used in many spots , always to enormous effect . Now , outside the treasure house of the City , I considered the City 's own general survival . All told , it had withstood the onslaught unusually well . And yet - it was empty . None of the stories explained that . Of course , perhaps the living citizens had simply fled or been captured . I wondered too , why the clever aerialist bombardiers had not put out the second sun , while they were at it . Conceivably those electric bombs just could not fly upward ?", 'I jumped .

Elsewhere in the City lay other caches , but nothing like this one . Nothing but this one was worth bothering with , if you had actually managed to reach the City , scale the walls , get in . Why then , I had murmured all those miles and days ago , had no one else , the Source himself for example , ever gone           there , and returned richer than a thousand kings . But they could only carry so much down the mountains and the walls . And as there was such a lot , still plenty of it was left . As for himself , he thanked me for my compliment , but he was too old for such a jaunt . We had cut him in , of course .

In those minutes as we ran inside the dusk within that City canyon , and threw ourselves headlong up the pillars , and next at the low balcony rail of a tall window - there flashed through my mind quick images of my days in the Thiefs ' School of Sheemelay . I saw the teachers , the fellow pupils - even the thick green quarrel trees in the courtyards . Although , as with all such institutions , the school was reckoned to be a secret , everyone knew . The town was proud of it . They also took a cut from           trained thief anyway never robs on his own turf - so the better school a town has , the safer its townizens .", 'The window behind the railing had a kind of glass in it . It was the type of glass that is melded all through to metal , opaque and shining like tarnished platinum . We could see nothing the other side of it either , in the non-light . But Hassent produced his glass-biter , and scored in swiftly , so a pane dropped away . We crushed through after , into the dark behind the dark .', 'Once inside the Thesaury , Hassent and I froze again .

I mean , if it had n\'t , we \'d have been stumbling over it everywhere already . " And then , having consulted me and ignored my opinion , Hassent switched on his sparkle . It sat up on his left shoulder like a tiny obedient moon , casting out its bluish clarity . " Going to chance yours , then ? " he queried .', '" This is one of the outer Arrival Rooms , " I said .

Qualium was there in balls too , and milky galvanic schist in globes , which were only less in girth than the breathtaking globes of the rose-white pearls .... Against the walls , marshaled behind the rest , were banks of jade , green and purple , and man-high sheets of aromaticor , with useful perforations so strips could be torn off - And there were other things one barely glanced at , faced with such riches showers of polished diamonds , crusts of scintillant coppery tope", 'But then .

Thus farewell - and greetings .', 'IT \'S ALWAYS like this in these historic dumps , " said Hass . " Bloody old dog-in-the-trough curses everywhere , We ca n\'t have it anymore , so neither can you . Touch the cash and it \'s unavoidable doom . "', 'We had recovered enough to choose some of the glorious stuff that was additionally portable , and pile it up in two neat heaps near the open door . But our hearts were not in it , really .', 'Neither of us had discussed the notion that the thing which made those noises was the very self same .', '" I ca n\'t concentrate , " Hassent growled suddenly , kicking into a miniature stack of faultless emeralds , so they spun           ca n\'t appreciate it . "', 'We sat down by the loot we had accumulated . " We have enough here , " I said , " anyway , probably , to ensure we can live individually to three hundred , in relative comfort . "', '" No , Hass . "', '" Well , we could , " I suggested doubtfully .', 'Later he said , " It \'s the thirty-third hour . The second sun \'s up by now , though not high yet . I have a theory about their Great Lantern , Aira . I think they put it up to counteract this thing , this monster menace they so sloppily inadvertently created           . Only the extra sun did n\'t work either , " he gloomily finished .', '" I \'ve got a theory too , Hass . I think the only people who turn up here - adventurers , thieves , whatever - get sent here by the ones who \'ve got too much sense to try it themselves . Like our beloved Source , who gave us the charms and such a choice map . He was n\'t that old , he could have done it . I believe we \'ve been used like experimental beasts . We \'ve been sent in to see what happens to us - if the City is safe yet for a general stealing spree . "', 'Again later , I said , " I wonder if just waiting it out down here until           its lair - "', 'Because I am contrasuggestive , as I said before , or over-optimistic or , more likely , too scared to be pessimistic , I began quietly to try to reason us out of this mood . I produced many cliches , perhaps even one stating the magicians had been spineless to give in .', 'A flaring orange light began to slant straight in at us from nowhere , yet somehow above           treasure chamber and a million jewelry eyes .', 'If things had been different , I might have been impressed by this underground view of the magic sun . It looked , through the glazing , precisely like a sun , rather smaller , though hardly less brilliant than the real one . I had heard the magicians produced it out of some alchientistic combustible previously unknown , firing it from a vast gun , which also struck it alight like flint-and-tinder , straight into the sky . Even at its apex , it hung lower than the true sun , of course , or the moon , inside the atmosphere of the world - but seen like this from the Thesaury , you would never guess .', 'I thought it was a cloud - something passing between us and the blinding amber of the second sun . Something falling .. weightless , harmless - But once through , that cry came with it , from silence , booming , like a wind of steel needles', 'Terror landed , still screaming , there in the Thesaury . It had come , not from the stair , but right through the metal-glass roof . For it could come right through anything .', 'I had rolled all the way back against a sheet of the priceless purple jade beloved of tyrants . The jade obligingly tipped down all round me , cracking , then breaking in shards on the floor - but that           middle of the vault , not needing to position itself , passing through and over everything that was there . It was shadow-black - everything that it covered passed within it , and disappeared - and formless . It was like those things they say are in the ocean deeps , and swim without limbs and see without eyes . This was all that , nor did it have any mouth to make its crying , nor any maw to take us in and keep us , as it did not keep the other things it swarmed upon and through and over . And it was Fear Incarnate . My bones had turned to jelly and my blood to talc . Though I am strong , then I had no strength . I lay among the broken fire-conducting jade , and became an abject victim , as the mages had done . Just as Hassent was doing . As anyone would .', 'Bewildered , I saw Hassent abruptly roll again , and leap back to his feet . He was running to where the huge rods of electris stood in ranks , and the balls of qualium and schist . Sprawled there , I watched , and observed him heft one of the enormous spear-like bolts . I thought , Panic has sent him off his head - he was going to attempt to lance the creature of darkness - which somehow could swallow nothing save one thing anything which lived - but a spear would pass through it , useless , for It was made only of black , only of nothing , only of utter night', 'We kept at this , slinging , casting anything we could manage .', 'Not looking , throwing missiles , yet I began to lose hope . This seemed the proper moment to do so . And then , the miracle . In one spasm , all the roof glass fissured together , the metal bonding preventing its breaking open or dropping through , keeping the outer skin whole , but letting it shatter internally . For a second there was a kaleidoscope of spattering lights , then a freckled darkness , and then full dark came back .', '" We had the same thought again , " he said .', '" Well , let \'s not debate our genius potency . We have whatever time is left before either 1 ) the whole ceiling collapses and we go back to the first chess-square , or 2 ) the ceiling collapses after the Great Lantern has passed but while the real sun is coming up . The only safe time was dusk . But we dare n\'t wait . "', '" And meanwhile , up there , what chance do we have ? "', '" They learned that , the mighty magicians , but they could n\'t do a thing . "', 'Inodded , ridiculously glad to be the one ahead this time .', 'Yet when they made their sun , they were high as balloons on the joy of their talents , and what they could do . Possibly they built it on a whim , because they wanted long summer evenings that went on till dawn . But maybe they were afraid of the dark in their souls .', 'They launched the Great Lantern and outlawed night from their City forever . More , they killed the night there . Then there could only be twilight , a sunrise , and another sunrise .', 'Animate things straying into the City , beasts , birds , people , stirred it up . Very likely it would lie almost quiescent when no one was about . Yet despite its birth from an unreal sun , in the violent light of any sun therefore , the true sun - it must also be active . It was a shadow .', 'Getting everything up the seventeen or eighteen staircases was quite a haul . We did it again in total darkness . That was the only way to be safe .', 'When we reached the area behind the outer Arrival Room , we kept well back , because through the windows the sun was boring , shining it all up to gold . The Great Lantern gives a radiance resembling that kind of ripe , syrupy desert sunset people remark on and praise . I hate that sort of           me .', 'Jade is always valuable . The black , white , and green jades for jewelry and statues . The purple jade is also beautiful but has other properties worth a lot more .', 'I have heard them say , in the places they have used fire-conducting jade , called also so playfully , Plum-Breath , that it turned day to night , and put out the sun .', 'When we had got down in the valley , it was dawn . The sun rising was the actual sun . Staring back up , even if we could barely see with our tortured eyes , we beheld how the City of the magicians now perched under a chain of tiny umbrellas of Plum-Breath , which marked our escape route . The Great Lantern itself was invisible , then visible , coming and going as it sank . But we heard something somewhere , crying . They were etiolate cries of anguish and excruciation beyond human comprehending , endurance , or pity .', 'From the treasure city we had brought out not a single valuable . All we had carried was as much purple jade as we could , and we had spent all that to save our lives . What is life worth , after all ? To most of us , everything           back , urt-less , over the desert toward civilization , we planned a dainty retribution on our helpful Source , who had experimentally sent us to die . We did not ever talk about the City . We never discussed either one ultimate thing- which was the reason no one had ever attempted to destroy the Great Lantern , the sun which had caused the creature of dead night . I will put this down , nevertheless , in case anyone ever thinks they would be doing us all a service ( and incidentally enabling themselves to become incredibly rich ) by smashing that unreal , second sun . Leave it alone ! Why ? Because the second sun is what keeps the creature in the City .

But anyway , she went down the road behind him that night feeling cold . He strode along invested with his new dignity , thought and planned out loud , unconscious of her thoughts .

" THE VERY NEXT DAY WITH MONEY OUT OF HIS own pocket he sent off to Sears , Roebuck and Company for the street lamp and told the town to meet the following Thursday night to vote on it . Nobody had ever thought of street lamps and some of them said it was a useless notion . They went so far as to vote against it , but the majority ruled . But the whole town got vain over it after it came . That was because the Mayor did n\'t just take it out of the crate and stick it up on a post . He unwrapped it and had it wiped off carefully and put it up on a showcase for a week for everybody to see . Then he set a time for the lighting and sent word all around Orange County for one           men out to the swamp to cut the finest and the straightest cypress post they could find , and kept on sending them back to hunt another one until they found one that pleased him . He had talked to the people already about the hospitality of the occasion . " Y\'all know we ca n\'t invite people to our town just dry long so . I god , naw .

" That \'s the way it went , too . The women got together the sweets and the men looked after the meats . The day before the lighting , they dug a big hole in back of the store and filled it full of oak wood and burned it down to a           night to barbecue the three hogs . Hambo and Pearson had full charge while the others helped out with turning the meat now and then while Hambo swabbed it all over with the sauce . In between times they told stories , laughed and told more stories and sung songs . They cut all sorts of capers and whiffed the meat as it slowly came to perfection with the seasoning penetrating to the bone . The younger boys had to rig up the saw-horses with boards for the women to use as tables . Then it was after sun-up and everybody not needed went home to rest up for the feast . By five o\'clock the town was full of every kind of a vehicle and swarming with people . They wanted to see that lamp lit at dusk . Near the time , Joe assembled everybody in the street before the store and made a speech . " Folkses , de sun is goin " down . De Sun-maker brings it up in de mornin \' , and de Sun-maker sends it tuh bed at night . Us poor           up nor to slow it down .

Brother Davis , lead us in a word uh prayer . Ask uh blessin " on dis town in uh most particular manner . While Davis chanted a traditional prayer-poem with his own variations , Joe mounted the box that had been placed for the purpose and opened the brazen door of the lamp . As the word Amen was said , he touched the lighted match to the wick , and           walk in de light , de beautiful light Come where the dew drops of mercy shine bright Shine all around us by day and by night Jesus , the light of the world . They , all of them , all of the people took it up and sung it over and over until it was wrung dry , and no further innovations of tone and tempo were conceivable . Then they hushed and ate barbecue . When it was all over that night in bed Jody asked Janie , " Well , honey , how yuh lak being Mrs. Mayor ?

Her unique upbringing led her to focus on AfricanAmerican success , not oppression , in her work . EDUCATION Howard University , Barnard College JACK OF ALL TRADES Hurston studied anthropology with the famous anthropologist Franz Boas , working for him in Harlem , and later returning to Florida to study and collect folklore . She wrote a play , Mule Bone , with Langston Hughes and a Broadway theatrical revue . In 1936 , she won a Guggenheim Fellowship to study West Indian Obeah practices .

Eda Marina turned down the hallway and knocked on the door of her          ", 'The room was in the main offices of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police . When Section Chief Nojima turned away from the window , he said with his trademark poker face , " Marina , there \'s been a murder .

What could that mean ? wondered Marina .', '" The suspect ran past the three men , who were dazed , and disappeared through the gate into the Special Seventh Ward , leaving behind the murder weapon-a fruit knife-and one apple .

Marina , slightly puzzled .', '" Exactly . What people call Balloon Town . "', '" Right . The problem is that the gate in question is only for the use of the residents . The witnesses \' statements all indicate that the suspect is a pregnant woman , one clearly in the latter half of her term . "', '" The suspect was a pregnant woman ! "', 'The words pregnancy , pregnant women , and childbirth were not ones that well-brought-up women used . Marina had graduated from an old-fashioned women \'s college in the Second Ward ; it was a fact that she had always tried to           lifted , the use of artificial uteruses ( known as in vitro gestation or AU ) soon became fashionable , and in due time it became the norm . Just as in the days when the place where women gave birth changed from the home to the hospital , " safe birth " was the catch phrase . In contemporary society a fetus gestated inside the mother could not be shielded from harmful things like toxins , electromagnetic waves , and noise . As a result , the AU wards in hospitals were the only places considered to be safe . There was also the problem of the mother \'s career to be considered . No matter how many nurseries were established , women were the ones who were pregnant for nine months and thus continued to juggle two careers . While they worked , the stress would have a detrimental effect upon the fetus .', 'Among one group of women , however , there was dissent .', 'Tokyo was the one city which responded to this demand . The various economic and governmental functions of the city were divided up ( among them , the Metropolitan Police ) , and the wards were reorganized to prevent the city center from becoming a ghost town . The entire city was redesigned , with wards spiraling outward-the First Ward in the center became the business district , the Second Ward became the residential area , and so forth .', 'Many women wondered who would want to endure the months of inconvenience , the deformed body , and the painful experience of childbirth , but people regarded those willing to take the trouble to do just that as a very different sort altogether . This special ward continued to be a paradise for women who wanted a quiet environment in which           somehow started to call it Balloon Town , but with no bad intent .', '" So you were told that there were multiple witnesses , " asked Eda Marina as she stood in Nojima \'s office .', '" In that case , we can call a police sketch artist and circulate a sketch among the residents .

The apple was n\'t investigated , but I doubt that would be possible . "', '" It seems that we should handle this case without the computers .

"', "As she passed through the gate , thinking about what useful information this was , she felt a soft breeze against her cheek . Marina noticed that it blew from the thick row of green trees . Through them , one could see a big pond beyond , with a five- or six-yard-high stone statue . The statue was of a woman . It had deeply carved features and a cascade of hair , with a body shaped like a pear . It was a giant pregnant woman , clad in light clothes , and standing with her hips slightly swiveled . Coming closer , Marina could see a pigeon sitting on its head and two more sitting on the statue 's protruding belly .", '" That statue . . . " Marina began .', '" Why is the jug on that platform ? "', "Marina did not know how to respond to this , so she did n't say anything . Through a break in the trees , an open area came into view . It was a park . Small paths ran between the trees , with flowers and benches placed here and there . Basking in the sunshine were a number of people sitting or strolling around . All of them were pregnant women           you might imagine that they are normally proportioned except for their protruding bellies . You would be wrong . Their hips and thighs were fleshy , the lower halves of their bodies were massive , and from every direction and from every angle they produced unusual silhouettes . They wore jumper skirts with numerous gathers , making them look like triangles .", "In the bright light , these strangely shaped figures moved slowly , as if in a nightmare . Weaving among them were Ms. Takayama with her staff badge and Marina with her visitor 's badge , walking at a brisk pace .", '" Sure . . " said Marina vaguely , suspecting that Ms. Takayama looked at these pregnant women as if they were some species of animal . If you viewed           sort of attractive creature , drifting through the greenery . The spring breeze softly billowed the pastel-colored skirts of the women as they waddled about-at least , to the extent that their skirts could fill with wind .', '" It does n\'t mean that they are strutting , " said Ms. Takayama .', 'She stopped in midsentence as a woman close to them dropped her handkerchief . Ms. Takayama quickly crouched down and retrieved it , handing it to the woman with a big smile .', '" It \'s hard for these women to crouch down . " Ms. Takayama continued to smile as she spoke , and Marina secretly sighed .', '" Those clothes-are they some kind of uniform ? " she asked . Every woman was wearing the same kind of dress , differing only in their colors .', "If these outfits were standard , then given what was known about the criminal 's clothing , it would be hard to find the person in question . Marina was depressed . Furthermore , nearly everyone was carrying a picnic basket .", '" Well , I think it \'s a good idea to wear a girdle sometimes . " Marina overheard snippets of conversation .', '" No , no , cotton is best for the skin . You do n\'t want to get heat rash during the summer . "', '" I just discovered a new way to do it . Instead of wrapping it around your body , you hold the end , leave the rest on the floor , and spin \' round and \' round . That makes it easier to wrap . "', '" What is bleached cotton ? " Marina asked Ms. Takayama .', "Ms. Takayama 's office was a tidy room . Her only decoration was a           eyed suspiciously .", '" I was surprised , " Marina said candidly . " I only saw women with really big bellies . Are n\'t there any women in the earlier stages of pregnancy ? "', 'Ms. Takayama took a drink of tea .', 'The " thud " noise was surprisingly real , and Marina felt a           it used to be , " said Ms. Takayama . " AU is somehow unnatural . Do you know , Detective , the most popular way to make babies ? "', '" When a couple decides to have a baby , first both men and women quit using birth control . They go to the hospital and borrow a small boxlike machine , which determines when a woman ovulates . Then , on the appropriate day , they have sex . The next day they can go to the hospital . At the hospital , the woman has a procedure called the morning after \' ; if fertilization has occurred , then in several days , before the embryo becomes implanted in the uterus , the woman undergoes the extraction procedure . After that , the rest is left to the hospital . The pregnancy is artificially maintained , while the woman returns home           medicine made this kind of process almost entirely painless . The ex-utero fertilization of the past and the process of egg extraction were relatively painful and dangerous .', '" Ms. Takayama , " asked Marina , " Why do you think that AU is bad ? Because it \'s not natural ? "', '" How ? "', '" Make a decision ? "', '" When you have AU , " Marina asked , " is there a way to avoid the monitoring function ? "', '" The State ? "', '" Although , " said Ms. Takayama , " when you compare it to SAU , AU is preferable . "', '" That \'s terrible , " Marina said angrily .', '" Do you think that people would refuse to use it ? No one would accept such .           a slogan when AU begun , " said Ms. Takayama , " It \'s more baby-friendly than the womb . \' Safety for the baby was the official selling point . Women \'s comfort was what came with it . Once you understand this situation , when someone says , we made an even safer way , \' it becomes impossible to object ... officially . "', 'Ms. Takayama continued , " In comparison , AU really is better . Of course , I think that raising the child in the mother \'s womb is the best . What do you think , Detective Eda ? "', "Although Ms. Takayama 's words were persuasive , Marina did n't feel as if she could subject her body to something like that . She would n't be able to give up the slender body that she got from the gym and undergo something like pregnancy instead .", '" Are you single ? "', 'Marina wondered if this was a joke , but the eyes behind the glasses were serious . She decided to return to the original question . " Let \'s talk about the incident , " she said straightforwardly .', '" We have n\'t necessarily decided that a resident of this town is the suspect . Still , we believe that the suspect was a pregnant woman , based upon eyewitness accounts . "', '" The problem is the security system here . Each resident carries a special ID card . If they do n\'t have it , then           "', '" Do you think that someone could have stolen an ID card ? "', '" I understand . " Marina now was sure that the suspect had to be one of the residents . " There is something that I want to confirm about the special gate . I assume that there \'s a sensor that checks the IDs of the people who have come through the gate . Is there some way to record who uses the gate and when ? "', 'These pregnant women were treated like a rare breed of animal-a delicate , shy animal , one that needed to           .', '" Did you see a pregnant woman run from this gate yesterday ? " Marina asked .', 'She was excited when she heard this answer . Marina was on a walking path behind a huge supermarket . All roads except the main streets could be called walking paths , since they wound through the trees .', '" There was a person who emerged from the shadow of those trees , " drawled a woman in a light-blue jumper . Her leisurely way of speaking was one of the reasons Marina was irritated           a full head of steam . She turned the corner , and then I could n\'t see her . "', '" Hmm . She looked like she was just eight months along . "', '" Right . She certainly was bigger than me . "', '" If there is anything else . . . " Marina began .', '" Meaning what ? " Marina           wide and the lower area does n\'t stick out as much ? "', "As she said this , she stuck out her chest proudly . Marina wondered whether she should n't be embarrassed to say that her stomach was shaped like a tortoise shell . She took out her memo pad and wrote togaribara in it .", '" Anything else ? "', '" I do n\'t know ... "', 'The woman in the light-blue jumper stood with her arms folded over her           Pointing her finger , she said , " Well , I guess her hair was long , and I think that it was braided in the back . She was of average height , and she wore a salmon-pink jumper skirt . "', '" Was that helpful ? "', '" Do you want me to call my friend who was with me yesterday ? I think she \'s still in the supermarket . "', "Marina waited . When they finally arrived , she did n't feel as if she 'd waited that long . She 'd been prepared to wait half an hour . The returning woman was accompanied by another pregnant woman in a lemon-yellow jumper .", '" She had a togaribara ? " asked the woman in the sky-blue jumper .', 'Looking at her belly , one could tell that the shape was a little different from the belly of the first woman .', '" Do you remember anything about her face or her height ? " Marina asked .', 'Her description was almost identical to the one her friend offered . Of course , the size of her stomach and its shape were what caught their eye-nothing else .', '" She was a disgrace to pregnant women everywhere . "', '" That \'s right , " declared the lemon-yellow jumper . " She did n\'t have a blouse on , so she was just wearing the dress sundress-style . "', '" Is n\'t it ? It means that you do n\'t have to buy so many maternity clothes . "', "Looking at their peaceful faces , Marina 's head began to hurt . Why they looked so contented , she had no idea .", 'Okay , so it was a dumb idea . What can I say ; we were in love at the time . We thought we always would be . But two years cooped up together , three couples in a starship no bigger than a mail shuttle , showed us how ephemeral that could be . We knew we were in trouble the day Liam tried to kill Yavetra . Etinitu had been trying to delete Tilbey at least once a week for the last couple of months , but we all secretly hoped she \'d succeed . Kylona and I had discovered that it was actually kind of erotic to describe in detail how we would like to do each other in , so everybody knew we were n\'t really serious . But Liam and Yavetra had been inseparable since before we \'d left Islandia . If they started going after each other \'s throats , we were in worse shape than we thought . Tilbey caught Liam in the act , which was appropriate since Liam had           day , which was why he was trying to kill her now . Different acts , of course , but maybe not that different in the long run . Both involved destroying something precious to Liam . " Oh , great , another meeting , " Kylona said disgustedly when she heard what had happened . We \'d been holding group discussions more and more often lately , trying to talk out our problems before they overwhelmed us . Talking did n\'t do much good , but it was either a meeting or a duel , and with our ship light-years from home we did n\'t need any broken equipment . So we all gathered in front of the multimedia console in the " day room " -the only place on board the Spook big enough for all six of us at once-and prepared for another round of acrimony and tears . It would have been quite a scene to a passing alien , if there had been any out there at the time . Six milky-white ghosts drifting weightless inside our coasting starship , its walls wide open to           to keep our belongings from drifting away . We moved our lips to speak , but of course we made no sound in the vacuum . When Tilbey and I and Liam had first shed our bodies to become interstellar astronauts , we had required hardware implants in our throats and jaws to interpret our motions and translate them into speech , but on the long trip to Alpha Centauri , Tilbey had played around with the programming of our mass eliminators and devised a way to detect the simulated muscle impulses at their source . That eliminated the need for implants but not for the motions , so we jabbered away at each other like characters in a silent movie while the computer provided sound in our simulated eardrums . We might as well have said nothing for the first half hour . Accusations and recriminations were all we uttered , and we did n\'t even make up any interesting new ones . Finally Kylona said , " Hey , this is getting us nowhere . We \'ve got to figure out how to get along for the rest           up dead . " " One of us wo n\'t , " Liam said gruffly . She gave him a pitying look . " Do you really think any of us-even you-could survive the next three years alone in this ship ? After knowing you had murdered the rest of us ? How long would it take before your guilty conscience drove you crazy ? " " You mean crazier than I am now ? " He held out his hands . " Look , babe , I \'m already seeing ghosts , and frankly , you do n\'t scare me . " " Maybe I would if I took a little stroll through your mass eliminator . " The magnetically enhanced standing wave that made up her body would fry the electronics in his ghost generator the moment she slipped inside it . Of course she would have to get through two layers of safety precautions before she could reach it , but that would only slow her down . She had been studying electronics and mechanics during her time on board ; she was almost as good as           did n\'t know you better , I \'d think you were making a pass at me . Save your death threats for your boyfriend , Kylona . I \'ve got troubles enough without adding yours to the mix . " They stared at each other with a mixture of hatred and lust that only people who have shared the same living space for two years can produce . I was starting to worry , considering what Kylona found erotic these days , but Etinitu defused the situation by saying , " Hey , come on . The problem is really about space , not life or death . " Liam looked past me to her . " The problem is five other people who do n\'t have the self-discipline for an interstellar journey . " She rolled her eyes . " Who needs self -- discipline with you telling us all what to do all the time ? " He opened his mouth to argue , but I cut him off . " Look , we \'re all driving each other nuts , and Etinitu is right : it \'s           . We need to get away from each other for a while . " Kylona said , " I thought that was what we were trying to accomplish when we made separate staterooms for everybody . " " We were , " I agreed , " but the staterooms are too small to stay in for long . " " So let \'s make them bigger . " Tilbey shook his head . " This is a starship , not an apartment building . We \'ve pared its mass down so much already that it \'s as fragile as glass . If we start moving struts , it \'ll collapse like a house of cards the first time we use the thrusters to dodge a rock . " " How many rocks have we had to dodge since we left home ? " she asked him . " None , " he answered , " but the radar has found a big one a couple months ahead of us that we \'re only going to miss by a million kilometers . Who knows what kind of debris is floating around           " Well , then , how about if we start living on the outside of the ship ? There \'s lots of space out there . " " That \'s a great idea , " Liam said . " You guys all go on outside , and III stay here with the book readers and video players and the- " " I meant we could move that stuff outside and- " " And let it drift off to Aldebaran the moment the ship makes a course correction . " She glared at him . " We could tie it down . " " You were perhaps planning to lock Tilbey up first ? " He did n\'t need to say more . No matter how much Liam bugged him about it-perhaps because Liam bugged him so much about it -- Tilbey seemed to sow disaster wherever he went . The moment he got distracted , he would leave whatever he was doing parked in free fall , completely forgetting it until he needed it again , whereupon he would spend half the day hunting for it among the hundreds of           Tilbey knew enough to keep quiet . The rest of us floated there in silence as well , glaring at one another and waiting for the next bright idea to shoot down . I tried to think of one , just to be sporting , and nobody was more surprised than me when I actually came up with something . " If we ca n\'t make the Spook bigger , " I said , just thinking aloud more than actually suggesting anything , " How about if we make the individual spooks on board smaller instead ? " Liam looked at me like I was a moron , but he did n\'t bother to say so . Kylona cocked her head sideways , as if to decide if she \'d heard me correctly . Yavetra narrowed her eyebrows , and Etinitu frowned . But it was a thoughtful frown . We all looked at Tilbey . " What ? " he said , jerking alert when he realized he was the focus of attention . " Can we do that ? " I asked . Despite his clumsiness , he           up fast . " Do what ? " Tilbey asked . " Make ourselves smaller . " Now he frowned . Rubbing his chin , he said , " I do n\'t ... well , maybe if I ... I \'d have to recalibrate the- " " Can you do it ? " Ham demanded . " We can do it , " Kylona said . I looked over at her , still amazed at her transformation even though I had watched it in action . She had been a naked tropical island native just two years ago , but she \'d taken to technology like a teenager to credit . " How small ? " I asked her . " How small do you want ? Theoretically we could go clear down to the molecular level , but we \'d start having trouble with quantum shifts in the information stream at that scale . " I had been thinking mouse size , but I suddenly realized I was being too conservative . " We could actually get down to microbe size ? like bacteria ? Viruses ? " Tilbey           would be getting into the gray area . Your eyes would be too small to pick up light , for one thing . " " Bacterial size would be small enough . " I tried to remember how many bacteria could fit onto the head of a pin . A thousand ? More ? The Spook was two hundred and fifty feet long and forty feet wide ; if we were the size of bacteria , it would be big enough to keep us from bumping elbows no matter how long we stayed on board . Six ghosts looked at one another across the day room . Then , as one , we all shouted , " Let \'s do it ! " It took Tilbey and Kylona a week to alter our mass eliminators to allow us to shrink and grow at will . As with the coupling constant that governed our interaction with matter , we could n\'t get infinite power out of it , so we could n\'t stride across the cosmos in light-year sized leaps , but we could shrink as far as we wanted to           again in the day room while Tilbey told us how to control our new ability . " The computer will respond to verbal commands , " he said . " It \'ll try to keep you from doing anything stupid , but I \'m sure we have n\'t been able to think of everything , so be careful what you tell it to do . " Liam snorted , but Tilbey ignored him and went on . " Your feet will always be the reference point for body placement . That way you wo n\'t wind up hanging three feet away from the floor when you shrink . " But watch your head when you expand again , " Kylona added . " If you \'re underneath something , you \'re going to bang into it . " Tilbey nodded absently . " We \'ll still be able to hear each other if we want to , or we can scale down our hearing range to give us privacy . Even then , if you shout someone \'s name the computer will connect you , so do n\'t worry about           I shut it off completely ? " Liam asked . " You do n\'t . That would be stupid . In an emergency , the computer needs to be able to page you . " Tilbey turned toward Kylona without waiting for a reply . " You want to demonstrate how it works ? " " Sure . " She pushed herself up to the ceiling , reoriented herself so her feet touched the surface , and said , " Command , body scale one one-thousandth . " I had expected her to wink out like a burst soap bubble , but instead she shrank over a period of a couple of seconds . Apparently her mass eliminator could n\'t compensate instantly for the scale change . It did n\'t matter , really , but it was kind of alarming to watch . It looked as if the ship had sucked her into it . " Are you OK ? " I asked . I could see a tiny white speck on the ceiling that I assumed was her . " Fine , " she said . Her voice was           try it . " All right . " I pushed myself backward until I was against one of the few solid spaces in the wall-an access panel for the wiring conduits-then echoed her command . Everything else in the room flew away from me like shrapnel from an explosion . " Whoa ! " I said . " What \'s the matter ? " I laughed . " Nothing . I just was n\'t ready for the light show . " I looked around me . Deep grooves lined the metal . It had been silver before , not quite mirror-finished , but it was gray now and pitted with holes and bumps . Were those actual molecules ? I bent down to look closer and decided they were n\'t . They still had rough edges . I \'d have to go ten , maybe even a hundred times smaller to see individual molecules . The ceiling looked like it was about five miles away . The view reminded me of Freeport , the UN \'s orbital space station back home . Except four giants filled the space where the           long . One by one , Liam , Tilbey , Yavetra , and Etinitu each chose their territory and shrank to invisibility . " Everyone okay ? " Tilbey asked when the " oohs " and " aahs " had subsided . He got a flurry of affirmatives , then Liam \'s voice said , " Command , reduce hearing sensitivity to minimum . " " \' Bye ! " I told him , but he did n\'t respond . Maybe he was already out of touch . " Well , " I said to the others , suddenly reluctant to cut my last link with them , " give me a call if you get bored . " " Yeah , right , " said Tilbey . Yavetra and Etinitu giggled . Kylona said , " Be careful , Danny . " " You too , " I told her . And then I said " I love you , " because now that we were effectively farther apart than we had been in years , I realized I still did . " I love you too , "           and do n\'t call me for a while , okay ? " " I was n\'t planning on it , " I said , wounded . Tilbey laughed , then gave the command to isolate himself . I did the same a moment later , then I looked around at my surroundings to see where I wanted to go first . It really did n\'t matter . I could reach any place I wanted in a few seconds merely by expanding , moving over a few feet , and shrinking again . But the whole point of shrinking was to gain more personal space , so I decided to just stretch my legs a little , figuratively speaking , and explore my new domain . It turned out to be a literal leg-stretcher . When I pushed myself gently away from the wall , kicking off one of the ridges of metal and planning to just drift along for a while , I was surprised to feel a tug on my feet before they came loose . I coasted for a few body lengths , but within a few seconds           . " I got my feet under me before I hit and felt them slap the surface . It felt a little like I was wearing magnetic boots . I took a few experimental steps . Sure enough , my feet stuck . Not much , but enough to notice . I bent down and tried my hands ; same thing . Molecular adhesion ? Adsorption ? I could n\'t remember the right name , but I did remember that I \'d heard about the effect back in my college days . It was the reason why spinning fan blades could still gather dust , and why evacuated vessels could still hold air molecules . You actually had to go in and sweep them out if you wanted a pure vacuum . The effect was just enough to keep me from floating , but not enough to let me walk , so I reduced my scale a little and tried it again . Now the pits in the metal were like Lunar craters , and the scrapes like ditches , but I could walk almost normally around and over them           what I \'d discovered , but I decided to let them figure it out on their own . I think that decision marked the point at which I truly started to relax . I could just let the others be . Amazing . So I walked . Every now and then I would encounter a boulder . Dust grains , I assumed . I kicked a few of them loose , pitching them off into the void like a kid tossing rocks off a cliff , but I stopped when one made a U-turn and nearly whacked me on the head . We must have had opposite electrical charges or something . I did n\'t know , but it was clear that things did n\'t work the same as I expected them to on this scale . Then I saw the forested knoll . It looked so incongruous out there on the metal plain that it took me a while to accept what I was seeing , but it was still there after I blinked and rubbed my eyes so I walked toward it , watching it loom up out           an approaching boat . It looked so much like a tropical island , complete with palm trees , that I seriously doubted my sanity , but when I got closer I realized what it was . Fungus is one of the biggest problems on board a spaceship . You \'ve got to have enough humidity in the air to keep the crew healthy , but no matter how good your circulation system , there \'s bound to be condensation somewhere . And wherever you get condensation , you get mildew . The Spook had n\'t been exposed to moisture-heck , it had n\'t even held air-for years , but it had a long life as a cargo ship before we converted it into an interstellar explorer . And no matter how fastidious the crew , they could n\'t keep gunk from growing on the walls . We had n\'t bothered to clean it before we \'d gutted the life-support system . We were already dead by then ; what did we care ? But now I realized I cared a great deal . I ran the last few millimeters to           , and climbed up between the spore stalks to the top , feeling more at home than I had since Islandia . In all this sterile hardware , I \'d found an oasis . Up close there was no mistaking the hyphae for palm trees , but I did n\'t care . They were tall and biological , which was good enough for a guy who had n\'t seen so much as a blade of grass in two years . I plopped down on the " ground " at the base of one of them , folded my hands behind my head , and leaned back against the trunk . From the hilltop I could see all the way to the edge of the bulkhead in all directions . There was n\'t a horizon ; just a vanishing point where things on my current scale became too distant to resolve anymore . Normal-sized objects were still as clear as a bell , though . The latch to the access panel I was on towered upward in the distance , and beyond that a porthole stared at me like the eye           half a dozen more clumps of mold , and a pile of debris that dwarfed even them . I could n\'t tell what it was from here ; maybe a piece of lint or a full-blown dust bunny . I might go investigate later , but for now I was content to sit under a tree and let my mind wander . Now that I had a little distance from the others , it was time to explore the space inside my head as well as the space outside it . This was a nice respite , but I wondered if we \'d actually solved our problem . Living apart might keep us from killing each other , but it would n\'t repair the damage we had already done . No matter how much time or distance we put between us , we had attempted to murder each other . It would be hard to forget that . Every time we argued from now on , we would wonder if it would blow up into another attempt on our lives . I did n\'t know what to do about that           sometimes more disastrous than leaving them alone . I thought about our options , but in the end I decided to just wait a while and see how things went . As a ghost I did n\'t have to worry about finding food . I still liked to sleep , though . I took a long , satisfying nap there on my desert island , woke up delighted to realize that my dream was real , and celebrated by taking another nap . When I \'d had enough of that , I explored some more , finding topological delights in such things as woven tiedown straps and nonskid grating . The days blended together . Once , the ship lurched beneath my feet , sending me tumbling head over heels before I caught hold of a barrel-sized metal filing sticking up from a rivet . " Computer , what just happened ? " I asked , and its calm voice replied , " The collision avoidance system has diverted us around an oncoming obstacle . " " Oh . " So there were rocks out there after all . "           dusted myself off and considered calling the others to make sure they were okay , but I realized I did n\'t have to do that . " Computer , is everyone else all right ? " I asked . " All six crewmembers are unharmed , " it replied . So I continued on mv way . In a storage net , I found a sealed bottle that still had a whiff of air in it , and when I lowered my coupling constant and squeezed inside I discovered that the thermal motion of the air molecules gave me a pretty good massage . Later I found a piece of fiberglass and a piece of lint and learned that if you straddled the glass rod and rubbed it with the lint , you could build up a static charge , and then if you pushed dust particles down toward the end of the glass rod , they \'d fly off into space and the reaction would kick you the other way . It made a crude but effective rocket . I was crossing the space between the aft bulkhead and           of my eye . It was something big . I turned my head , expecting to see one of my shipmates grown tired of playing microbe , and I did see something vaguely man-shaped floating in the open space where the airlock used to be , but I could n\'t make the image resolve into anything familiar . It looked like whoever it was was covered in cellophane . Had Tilbey gotten tangled up in a plastic bag or something ? But the bag would n\'t expand with him unless he \'d set his coupling constant all the way to maximum . Then I realized whoever it was had eight limbs . " Holy shit , " I whispered . Did we have a spider on board ? The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out . How could a spider have survived this long without air or food ? It looked like it had wrapped itself in a cocoon , but I could n\'t see how that would help . It was definitely alive , though . Its limbs waved back and forth , and it           ship . Right toward me . " C-c-command , body scale normal ! " I yelled . I forgot that everything in the room would look like it was rushing toward me when I got larger . I threw out my hands to ward off what seemed to be an impending implosion ... ... and scared the daylights out of the alien who had just come in through the open frame of the airlock . We were even . I screamed louder than I had when I \'d died . I had misjudged the scale . This was n\'t a garden spider ; it was about half as tall as me , with a head like an artichoke on a barrel-shaped torso and eight arms sticking out from the sides . The moment it saw me , the petals on its head stuck straight out , filling its spacesuit helmet like a puffer fish that forgets it \'s in a goldfish bowl . It fired what I first thought was a weapon in its lower left hand , but when the reaction drove the creature backward , I realized it           What \'s the matter ? " Kylona asked , and a moment later I heard four other voices ask the same thing . My scream must have triggered the computer \'s emergency call to everyone . " Visitors ! " I shouted . " We \'ve got visitors ! " I cursed myself for not thinking to tell the damned computer to warn us about approaching ships , but who would have thought there would be any in the cold , thin darkness between stars ? All we \'d told the computer to do was avoid obstacles , and once the alien matched courses for docking , it would no longer be considered an obstacle . The alien shook its head . Whatever it had done to itself looked to have been painful . But it did it again a moment later when Liam sprang to full size across the room . Yavetra popped down from above , and Etinitu right beside her . They had apparently been exploring the ceiling together . The individual stalks that made up the alien \'s head writhed like snakes , then slowly started           palms out , and said , " It \'s all right . It \'s not really what it looks like . " " Yeah , right , we \'re not really ghosts , " Liam said sarcastically . " Whoops , I was wrong , we are . " It did n\'t matter what we said , of course , since the alien could n\'t hear us and we could n\'t hear it , but I turned to Liam and said " Shut up " anyway . Then I turned back to the alien and gestured for it to come forward again . The thought occurred to me that it might be hostile , but I was so starved for outside contact that I think I would have welcomed an invasion force if they would just talk to me in the process . The alien did n\'t look hostile anyway . It reached behind itself for the cargo net we had strung across the doorless airlock , all eight hands scrabbling madly to find the opening it had let itself in through . " Computer , can you detect any           Affirmative . Extremely high frequency , amplitude modulated . " " Link us up . " " Linked . " " It \'s OK , buddy , " I said softly , knowing it could n\'t understand me , but hoping that my tone of voice would tell it I was friendly . " Welcome aboard . Excuse the reception , but we were n\'t expecting visitors . " Its voice was a warbling moan . I did n\'t need to know its language to know it was terrified . Yavetra kicked off gently and did a slow tumble to land on her feet on the floor . The creature \'s moans changed pitch . They died down a little when she reached up to help Etinitu down . That apparently was n\'t the sort of behavior it expected from a ghost . Then Tilbey blossomed to full size underneath the multimedia console . Books went flying , their screens flickering like strobes as they hit the walls and ceiling . The whole cabinet ripped loose and crashed against the wall next to the airlock . And where it had           his head and shouting , " Ow owwwww oooowwww ow ! " The alien ripped a new hole in the cargo net and flung itself outside . I stuck my head out after it just in time to see it fire its reaction pistol and arc around the flank of the Spook to where its own ship waited , engines hot . " Do n\'t go ! " Yavetra shouted , but the moment the alien reached its airlock , the ship shivered like a dog shaking water off its coat and disappeared in a brilliant streak of light . " Shit , " I said . " The first new face to talk to in years and we scare him off . " Liam said nothing . He just advanced on Tilbey , grabbed him around the neck with both hands , and squeezed . " Hey ! " Tilbey shouted . " Cut it out . Hey , that hurts . " He kept on hollering long after Liam had crushed his throat . The computer that picked up his speech did n\'t care . Finally he said           and vanished back into the floor . Liam stomped on the spot where he \'d been , but that only sent Liam careening up to the ceiling . " Hah , missed me , " Tilbey said . Liam bounced all around the room , ransacking it for a weapon . We had pistols in the lander , but they would n\'t hurt a ghost , and they would n\'t have satisfied his bloodlust anyway . He flexed his hands a few times , then pushed himself over to the spot where Tilbey had disappeared . " Command , body scale one nine thousand , nine hundred and ninety -- ninth , " he growled , and a moment later he vanished . " I \'m coming for you , Tilbey , " he said . He \'d just shown that he could n\'t kill one of us with his bare hands , but that was n\'t going to stop him from trying . I looked out at the stars again , stars that seemed even farther away now than they had before . There was no catching our visitor           and the best we could do was fifty . Unless he came back , we still had three years of travel time ahead of us , and now our onboard animosity had spread to a new dimension . Kylona came in through the hatch leading to the cargo hold . She had evidently been doing her exploration back there . " Sounds like I missed all the fun , " she said gloomily . I turned to face her . She and Yavetra and Etinitu were floating amid the wreckage of the entertainment center , their dismay written all over their faces . What could I do to cheer them up ? For that matter , what could I do to cheer me up ? On a long voyage , you learn to make do with what \'s available . " On the contrary , " I said , taking a micromagnifier from the workbench and bending down to see if I could spot Liam and Tilbey . " It looks like the fun is just beginning .

I was in graduate school , of all places . I had no idea why . None of us did . We were extremely well-spoken rubber duckies . You could push us in any one direction , and we would flounder on forever . Sometimes , in the drowsy winter hallways , my conscience would rear up and remind me I was dumb with luck . Other times , I wished they \'d turn the whole place into a homeless shelter .', "A woman entered my field of vision from the right . She had the plumpest cheeks I 'd ever seen . Her eyes were pinched at the corners , and blue patches stood out below them . She looked as if she had n't slept in           seemed stingy and coarse and obvious by comparison .

She looked elegant and chimerical : the head of a lioness , the body of a swan . At dinner , I choked on my chicken korma . That was just for starters . I got lost on the way to the theater . I misplaced my wallet , and had to race home to get cash . We were twenty minutes late to           trying to figure out who was doomed and who fated . I spent most of the time smelling Basha , glancing at her profile , my fingers greasy with popcorn .', 'To which I would respond : Doy hickey .', "But that 's not the story I 'm telling now . No one-except those paid to listen-really wants to hear your musty songs of self-contempt . What we want is the glib aria of disastrous love , which is , finally , the purest expression of self-contempt .", 'She had a sense of humor as well . Imagine . She told me a story about dining with the Dean of Students at a welcoming banquet for exchange students . " They brought him steak , " she said . " I could n\'t believe the size . It was like a car           just at that minute I turned to him and said : \' You have such huge meat ! \' "', 'We were eating at my place . She was sitting there at my table , daintily cutting her chicken . I told stories about my life that suggested-far less subtly than I supposed-what a terrific guy I was . I cleared her plate and took it to the sink . Was n\'t I the disarmingly liberated bachelor type ? She stood . I stepped in front of her and let my face fall forward . She executed a brisk little side -- step . My lips smeared the side of her cheek . A pine cone fell from the tree outside , striking the roof with a soft thud , as if to close the subject .           : " Will I ever get to kiss you ? "', 'To which I wanted to say : Involved ? Who needs involved ?', "We kissed , and she smiled , her lips turning back on themselves . Her teeth were faintly discolored , as if she 'd had a quick bite of ashes . I had never seen the classic Slavic facial structure at such close quarters . When she laughed , her cheeks rose with the strange , graceful bulk of glaciers and her eyes became Mongol slashes .

Basha circled the pavilion , fretting over a belt , a bottle of lotion , blushing at the inquiries of the sales staff . She was a nervous shopper , which I took to be a mark of her unfamiliarity with the ritual . I had all sorts of crappy ideas rattling around my head about life in Poland . I knew , vaguely , that the Poles had broken from the Soviet Bloc . But I still imagined a lumpen gulag : endless lines , bare shelves , faces like potatoes in kerchiefs .

That was the big problem , the carrying part , the things it did to your body , not to mention the giving birth . Samantha was twenty-nine , which placed her , Riley liked to say , on the cusp of thirty , and thirty , he knew , was the magical age . If Riley had seen it once , he \'d seen it a million times .

In the afternoon , he had a clear shot at           Then he saw a raccoon . It was moving quickly through the underbrush . Riley approached it stealthily from behind a stand of trees and took aim . He shot at it once , twice . A high-pitched scream rang out , and the raccoon rolled over . Riley came up to examine it . It was big for a raccoon , and pale-skinned . It was a large raccoon , Riley could see now , perhaps the largest raccoon he 'd ever seen , an elephant of a raccoon Riley had shot , and this pleased him beyond all reason , until he realized , bending over to examine the creature , that this was n't a raccoon , was n't a raccoon large or small , but a labrador retriever , a hunting dog .

His first novel was published in 1978 and sixteen more have seen print since then , including The Shattered World and Voodoo Child . His next novel , Armageddon Blues , is due out in 2004 . He also has extensive screenwriting credits , including an Emmy award for his work on Batman : The Animated Series . His most recent publication is an anthology he and John Pelan coedited , Shadows Over Baker Street , which crosses Sherlock Holmes with H. P. Lovecraft \'s cosmos . Mr. Reaves lives in Los Angeles . Born in 1950 , he fits in squarely with the Baby Boomers and he observes their nature acutely in this new tale .', 'In Huneven \'s first novel , Round Rock ( September 1998 ) , spiritual crisis came in the form of alcoholism , and its solution was found in Alcoholics Anonymous(AA) and personal recovery .

It \'s been snowing so long that beyond this marker and surrounding the house in all directions is an architecture of pure whiteness . From our spot high up on a hill , the house and yard have been stripped bare of snow by the wind as if some strange vacuum had occurred . The pole lamps near the barn show big flakes moving parallel to the ground . The blizzard ebbs and flows and mutes the sun-not even a glow remains , just a general directional change of intensity throughout the day-then its back to roaring black . In the night snowplows come and go bringing a yellow tunnel of light ; a muffled roar like a ship scraping bottom underscores but fails to answer the question : Who drives them and where are they dispatched from ? Erin says that I am wrong , that there has n\'t been a snow plow in two weeks . I still hear them , I say . Sometimes they rumble past when she is asleep . " Then how           it never stops snowing . " " It \'s like ashes , " she says , watching them fall . " Yes , " I reply , " but these melt on the tongue .

Because of the quarantine she is trapped here and spends her time in the blue reclining chair , painting different colors on her nails with that sullen pout she \'s perfected since she ran out of cigarettes . That is , when she is not pacing from picture window to picture window , or trying out different stations on the small radio she carries with her wherever we go . " No music . Whoever heard of a radio station not playing music . It \'s all flu all the time , " she says , looking over at me hoping I will crack a smile . The coffee maker gurgles awake in the kitchen . Caffeine is the only drug left on my shelves . What passes for antibiotics , flu antidote , is nothing more           , a whole shelf of donated samples . The television fills the waiting room with a cold blue static , seeping into my dreams like an arctic light . Erin watches it expectantly , knowing that at any moment it could come to life and bring her back into the world . Seventeen days ago a Nor\'easter spiraled up the coast , picking up moisture , changing direction , before it stalled in a giant vortex of snow and wind . Whole houses smothered . No patients have come to the door in days . We receive requests on the CB radio and make house calls using the snow machine the town gave me when I agreed to open the clinic just after finishing my residency . The old people who \'ve lived in Vermont for eighty , ninety years know people who knew people who spoke about the blizzards of the 1880s and 90s . Whole locomotives buried and no one thought it was the end of the world then , did they ? They found shovels and dug tunnels to the barn where their cows screamed from udders           dull blue light . They never worried that spring would not bring its dripping eaves and mad sparrows . Somewhere , beneath the tons of snow and the entombed trains , delirious crocuses lay ready to leap out of the mud . Nothing to worry about , no black clouds on the horizon . I believe in the oath , not that it matters to my patients anymore . My presence-the jarring nature of my advice-turns them incoherent and asleep on their feet . They see patterns , wallpaper speckled to please , but not the enormity of the event itself . all I have is my uniform , my stainless steel instruments . The snow machine still has enough gas to bum and so each day and night Erin and I head out on our rounds . On low in the background , my CB radio carries the voice of a woman patient , - some delusional plainspoken lawyer \'s wife hallucinates a monologue into the microphone like an incessant far-off waterfall of words . She makes me sick with her pleading . They need . I must .           \'s dying . " The woman said before she clicked off . I warm my hand around the coffee mug and hold it close to my face . Better to stay inside where it \'s warm and dry . The voice never identifies itself with a name although they all sound the same when they beg through the radio . I want to rest , to turn the radio off and disappear into the warmth of my dreams . The house the woman called from should only be five miles away , if only we can manage to find the turn-offs and the bridges again . Erin will drive the machine and knows her way around this confusing country with its twisting hollows and maze of intersecting roads . Many of these roads are little more than ancient paths carved into the ridgelines by centuries of Algonquin feet . " What is your temperature ? " Erin asks . " I \'m fine , " I say , knowing that I \'m burning up again , fighting off hallucinations and waking dreams . For two weeks I \'ve kept it           . I get weaker each day the epidemic continues . " Most of these people you are visiting will die , " she says , turning and showing off her unnerving eyes . I must hold onto her belt or risk falling off and being lost in the snow . The shape of her hips and the smell of her neck I want to lose myself in . On more than one occasion she offered herself to me , and each time I declined . She opens up the throttle at the small plateau between steep hills . Nothing is moving but us . I close my eyes and lean into the noise . Soon an orange glow appears in front of the machine . My own fever has me slightly off balance , sweating and imagining that the light is a warning we should be moving away from instead of speeding toward . Just outside of Brandon a ranch house burns ; the flames higher than the melting snow drifts . A black plume of smoke moves into the white sky and disappears . Erin stops , idles the           It is odd when the roof collapses and the walls fall inward . No people are visible . There seems to be no one within miles . As we near our destination , the woman \'s directions become familiar . It is the giant rambling house of judge Wheatcraft and his wife . A brass plaque near the door claims circa 1791 . Always immaculately preserved , the grounds clean of branches , the grass cut and with two yellow Labs asleep in the front yard . We leave the machine near the driveway and climb over the wooden fence because the gate is snowed shut with drifts . No telltale signs of life , no footprints in or out , and no snow cleared away . A muted yellow candle light illuminates the rooms from within and Erin claims to have seen the face of a woman from a second story window . I have been to this house many times in the past for parties and small dinner gatherings . The judge went to Dartmouth and his wife to Smith and they carried with them English furniture heirlooms           , but reclusive of late since both their sons died before them . The stone carriage entrance is the only porch that has been cleaned of snow and swept with a broom . Split wood is stacked up along its length and the sound of music comes from within the old kitchen where the couple spend most of their time during the winter . Erin clears away the frost on the window and peers in . Mrs. Wheatcraft \'s face appears immediately at the door , absent her usual exuberant smile and lightness ; her face is clouded over and pained , eyes barely stopping to focus , and she turns quickly away from looking too closely at her guests . " Both of you come in , please , before you freeze . " " I did n\'t recognize your voice on the radio . " " My radio voice , no less . Well , step on in and I \'ll make the drinks . Let me just go and get another bottle of gin from the freezer . You know what a fussbudget he is about his           each day and started exactly at five . When I told him that the drink was " the only legal narcotic left in America , " he put his finger to his lips and whispered an admonition , " Please , please , keep it our secret then . " I have my medicine bag ready and stethoscope warming around my neck . " Should n\'t I go and see the judge , first ? " She \'s busy cutting cheese and arranging plates and ignores my question . " What \'s it going to be today , doctor ? The House special , as usual ? " I nod and try to smile . " I really should go up and see the patient . " " We \'re all patients these days , are n\'t we ? " She gives me a quizzical look , her left eyebrow raised and twitching . " Anyway , cocktail hour is not optional in this house . " She leaves us alone and goes into the pantry to get something . Erin gives me her cross-eyed " what gives " look           in this house at this time of day to have drinks . " " Do n\'t they know ? " " She called us , remember . The judge is dying . Come immediately , and so on . " Mrs. Wheatcraft reenters the room holding a bottle of Blue Sapphire gin . " Have you two made up your minds about the drinks ? Will you be joining the judge ? " " Thank you , I will . " Erin nods her head in agreement , then winks at me . " He \'s well enough to drink ? " Mrs. Wheatcraft pauses , sets the bottle down , and clucks her tongue at me in a mock admonishing way that tells me how she must have once been seductive and graceful . The preparation for the judge \'s martini is elaborate and painstaking : glasses are pre-chilled , gin measured out in advance and all the tools placed within easy reach . After emptying each glass of its ice she quickly pours the contents of the martini into a shaker , turns it over once , and           green olive without a toothpick . We each carry a serving plate and head into the large front room , which serves as library and music room . Floor-toceiling bookcases cover all but one wall where an expensive stereo system is hidden behind shuttered doors . A black grand piano shares the floor with a haphazard collection of couches , settees and love seats . Mrs. Wheatcraft sits down at the piano , carefully placing her own drink on a waiting cork coaster . She opens the hood and begins to play Beethoven , showing off her years of lessons , her years of daily playing . Erin rolls her eyes at me again and sips carefully at her narcotic . She \'s a smart local girl , prone to a streak of proletarian snobbery . Since I have been here before and there is no talk of the storm , no discussion of the snow , or any mention of sickness , I feel exhausted and ready to sleep . The drink warms outward , head and torso first , then works its way into my extremities . She           ceiling , " Marshall Wheatcraft ! " Erin nearly spills her drink . Then , in a softer tone , " I ca n\'t imagine what \'s keeping him . " She begins the piece again , then abruptly stops and closes the lid . " Would you like some of the anti-viral pills ? " I \'m afraid of letting too much silence accumulate . " You mentioned that he was ill . " " I \'m not a fool , Doctor , I know about the aspirin . Have you ever seen one religious icon in this house , outside of the mandalas in the mud room ? " I had , indeed , seen the mandalas in the mud room . Treasure brought back from a trip to Nepal . " Look , " she says , " It \'s snowing , " a look of astonishment and glee on her face , as if it were the first snow of the year falling unexpectedly on her lawn . Erin and I both turn to look out the floor to ceiling windows , each with a strip           panes are original and contain hand-blown glass that gives back intermittent patches of distortion . Erin excuses herself for the bathroom and motions to me with her eyes to distract Mrs. Wheatcraft while she looks around . " I \'ll have to make him another drink now . That one is spoiled . He hates it when they get warm . " The temperature in this part of the house was cold enough that little puffs of condensation could be seen on our breaths . " Your furnace still working ? " " Oh , that . Well , not exactly . We \'ve been burning wood now and look what I \'ve gone and done . I \'ve forgotten to start the other one for this part of the house . You know we practically live in that kitchen in the winter . " " Maybe I should go up and have a look at him now . " Her head slowly goes down and touches the piano , making a small thud . " Mrs. Wheatcraft ? " She raises her head , tilts it to the side           spot in the distance . I hear the floorboards above our heads creak and know that it is Erin sneaking around up there . " He \'s been upstairs for a long time , " she says , her eyes looking up as if she has heard the footsteps , too . I watch and wait for her to continue but she turns her head away and covers it with in her arms . In the harsh light coming through the windows she looks carved out of her seat at the piano , more an apparition than any real woman . From upstairs come more sounds of doors opening and closing , a whispering voice in an argument with itself . Erin is no longer being stealthy as before , although Mrs. Wheatcraft has n\'t moved or spoken in many minutes . I shudder at the coldness in the room and break into another awful fever sweat . " Why did you come all the way here in such bad weather ? " " You called . " Pleading , I think , begging , and here we are drinking           the world . If I could just close my eyes and rest , just nap for a brief ecstatic minute , I would feel fine again . " I love house calls . " She says this with an exaggerated stage voice . Garbo refusing to dance . " I have a machine-for the snow . " " You look a little pale , yourself , Doctor . " " Do n\'t worry about me , I \'ll make it through . " " Too tough and special to die like the rest ? " " I \'m as careful as I can be about protecting myself . " " So this visit is about your oath ; you come to save us , but sacrifice yourself ? " " Mrs. Wheatcraft . . . I- " " -You throw yourself into the maw . Perhaps you \'ve gone too far this time . What if there \'s no chance of getting back ? " I am nervous from her questions and begin fidgeting with the buttons on my shirt . The house is hotter and hotter . " Have           laughs . " Not unless it started all by itself . " She points to her ear and makes a twisting motion with her hand . " It \'s all in your head , dear . Feverish , beginning to hallucinate . I know it well . " " I have the snow machine . " " Yes , you certainly do . You mentioned it not a minute ago . " " When the town gave it to me I thought it was just a toy . " " This machine takes you from one world into the next ? " " In a sense , Mrs. Wheatcraft , yes . Lately it \'s taken me from one disaster to the next . " " Well , now you can relax and stay awhile . " She grows quiet again and the huge maples outside the windows groan and snap in the cold . " Is everything okay here ? I mean , you called and seemed very upset . You said it was a matter of life and death . " " I did n\'t want to be           down on her arms and closing her eyes . Her skin is so thin that her skull can be seen clearly outlined beneath . The fever sends a spasm through my body . " But you \'re not alone . " " Exactly , " she says , her voice a whisper , as if it were coming from the center of her body instead of her throat . " I thank you for giving me that simple gift . I could n\'t bear it alone . And it \'s so much better this way , do n\'t you agree ? " Without asking I go to the drink tray and take the judge \'s martini and drink it in two gulps . As the light fades in the room , the snow swirls in the front yard creating eddies and hypnotizing crosscurrent patterns . It is so quiet , the snow falling straight down as the wind eases , that I hear my heart pounding in my throat . I have to get out of this house and back to my own clinic . From this window during a           land in the middle of that great expanse of lawn . A familiar visitor for the Wheatcrafts , the heron came up from the nearby river to catch minnows in their small man-made pond . None of the other guests cared much or were used to seeing him there , so I was alone in going outside for a close-up look at this notoriously shy bird . When it sensed me moving it took flight and showed off its pre-historic design . A rhythmic noise like a low moaning brings me out of my reverie and I turn back to see if she is snoring at the piano . The face hidden beneath the pale arms is silent , - the sound came from upstairs . " Mrs. Wheatcraft ? " She fails to stir . I go close and say her name again , then reach out and touch her arm and shake it back and forth . It falls from its place and hangs down . She has no pulse when I feel her neck . In the short space of time I had the memory of the           come down the front staircase and I know it is Erin by the halting way she moves . Her silhouette appears in the opening between rooms but her features are out-of-focus . I walk toward her and see that her face is puffy and wet from tears . " Well ? " We stare at each other for a few seconds before she speaks . " You \'re covered in sweat . " " I \'m burning up . The furnace must have come on . " " It \'s freezing in here . " " The judge ? " " I did n\'t have to open the door to find him . " " Did you open the door ? " She cries at the thought of what she has seen . I do n\'t tell her about Mrs. Wheatcraft but she can see for herself if she bothers to look . " He \'s been in there for weeks . " She walks away toward the kitchen . " Where are you going ? " " I have to go out and get some fresh air . "           , hoping that she will wait . She laughs in that dismissive way of hers . " No you wo n\'t , " she says , her voice far away and coming from near the mud room . When I get there she is already gone . Her tracks go down the steps and disappear at the bottom , as if she had been swallowed up by the snow that is now as thick as fog . I call out her name but hear only the whistling and roaring . I look all throughout the house , calling her name , pleading that she appear and not be cruel at a time like this , in a situation already so hopeless . I do not open the door to the room that holds the judge , and I leave Mrs. Wheatcraft at the piano . It \'s so hot inside that sweat pours down my face and makes my clothing stick to my skin . Some old song pulses through my head as I shed my clothes and finally feel the cool air . just a shadow passing in the           the house mine to do with as I please . I careen off the walls , sending photographs crashing to the floor in the hallway . I grab my parka and drag it behind me out the same door that Erin disappeared from . The snowmobile is lightly coated with snow and when I turn the ignition button it purrs to an idle , its small headlamp pulsing with the slow breaths of the engine . Moving out into the dusk across an open field , the machine drives between the branches of a huge blue spruce and my coat is torn away . Ecstatic to be naked and moving quickly across the earth transformed-its order and glitter obliterated . The snow is so deep , I skim along the tops of the trees . The idea of my own house seems to recede as I move toward it ; my skin grows warmer and warmer until I am radiating like a furnace . Laughing , now . There are no tracks ahead of my machine , no breaks in the original surface into which I am carving lines . \n Read our original play about a young woman who became rap royalty .

AS THE OWNER of a highly tuned 300-hp Subaru WRX-one that should be good for high-1 2s in the quarter-mile-Shek should n\'t be late for anything . After all , we made it here on time from New York \'s Upper West Side . That is several miles on the subway , across Manhattan and into Queens . And then all the way to the last stop on the purple-colored 7 line : Main Street , Flushing . Queens , along with the Bronx and parts of Long Island , is where much of the sport compact tuning around New York City takes place . Less than five minutes away , under the shadow of Shea Stadium , is the Iron Triangle , a 13-block district of car parts and repair shops . A few blocks in the opposite direction is Francis Lewis Boulevard , infamous for its street races . Shek \'s yellow WRX eventually rumbles to an open spot across the street . " Cops stopped me , " he says when I settle myself into shotgun           a detective . I saw him in my rearview. he was following me for a couple of blocks . " This kind of shakedown happens a lot in Flushing , and it is nothing new for Shek , a business major at Stonybrook College on Long Island . Although he keeps his fixed-up WRX low-key-no loud graphics or wing-it still has an IHI VF34 turbo upgrade ( installed by Metric Subaru Performance Tuningmspt.net ) and enough power parts to make the seat rumble beneath my bottom . JDM tuning is generally known as the expensive practice of using only Japanesebrand parts . The letters stand for " Japanese domestic manufacturer , " and the Cliffs Notes version goes like this : A rare part is good , but an expensive one is better . " I learned about USDM and JDM parts through Option magazine , " Shek says , referring to the Japanese media monster that is an underground hit in America . Shortly after receiving the WRX for his birthday , Shek made a trip to Japan . " I bought all these videos and learned the history           videos . I looked up stores that advertised in Option and showed them to taxi drivers . And then they would drive me to the shops . I wound up sending lots of parts back from Japan , because it \'s cheaper than buying them in America . " Although Shek \'s car does n\'t look nearly as extreme as those found in the plot-deficient Hollywood movies-another aspect of JDM tuning , believe it or not , is subtletyit \'s got it where it counts . The suspension is complete Cusco . The wheels are Volk Racing CE28Ns . The interior has been completely reupholstered in Bride material . The body kit is either C-West or custom carbon fiber , like the side skirts ( JDM parts can be ordered at fizzautosports.com ) . And , well , we \'ve already tackled the engine , which continues to be the topic of our conversation . " I ca n\'t remember how many tickets I \'ve gotten , " Shek says . " A cop once made me get out of the car and gave me four tickets . One for           visible from the dash- " one for my exhaust , one for being too loud , one for disrupting the police . " I tell him they all sound like the same ticket ( no pun intended ) . Shek agrees , " Yeah , they \'re all the same . " " Are n\'t you scared of driving now ? " I ask . " It \'s a paranoia feeling , " he says , " but now I \'m used to it . I drive extra slow these days . " he smiles . " But sometimes I like to have fun . " Which is precisely what Shek does when we hit an open stretch on Francis Lewis . A few years ago , the police put an end to the racing by flooding the street . " They would open that hydrant over there , " Shek says , pointing , " and let it run for two hours . No one would be able to get any traction . " These days , Shek has moved on from the street . he began entering car           toward winning show trophies . As for the power , he is happy with 300 hp . It is streetable . " Besides , " he says , " there \'s nowhere in New York that you can really go all-out anyway . " \n WHEN THE ICE VEIN BLED dry at its capillary end , the rockers brought in their big equipment to bust it open for use as another farm tunnel . Their big equipment consisted of secondhand castoffs and other junk from the outer satellites , so Broadnax was n\'t surprised when the borer broke down again , grinding work to a halt .', 'An appreciative whistle sounded over the com , followed by a young woman \'s buoyant voice . " Showoff . "', '" Yeah , " he said as           own inability to resist stupid temptations .', '" So what do we have ?

Took him a while to die . All the little breakdowns since then had been blamed on his ghost tinkering with the equipment .', '" Maybe , " she said . " Have they burned him yet ? "', '" Yeah . " Broadnax really did n\'t want to talk about it . He held up his hands to show the dumb-gloves , though she           Listen , can you tell me what the food stock looks like ? With another delay ?

But divided over seven hundred people - "', '" - it \'s only a few more beans in every bowl of soup . "', 'Her smile flashed as if he were joking .

About Earth , sunside , but with air . You want to come by and watch it with my family later ? " Her courage all used up , she dropped her eyes and her voice faltered .

She really was very pretty .', 'The overhead lights gleamed in her dark , uncertain eyes .', '" I guess , " she said .', 'Her head twitched back , but not enough to break the contact between the helmets .', 'She reached for his arm and he paused . The helmets clicked like teeth as they touched again - some atmosphere leaked into the tunnel , a few millibars to check for seepage , enough for sound to travel . " So if I wanted to meet you - ? "', '" Maybe I do . When did you say ? "', 'She bit her lip . "           " Nah , " he said , yanking a sonic hammer out of the tool locker . He mimed busting out a few chunks of rock around the borer . " But I \'m glad I found it . "', '" That \'s not going to do much good , " she said over the com , a little bounce back in her voice .', "BACK IN HIS DARKENED quarters a few hours later , Broadnax lay sore and exhausted with his baby daughter Maya snuggled in the pouch on his chest . Her fist pressed against her mouth . Only a few months old , she weighed less than the sonic hammer but felt so much heavier . A greenish stain marked Broadnax 's shirt where she 'd spit up most of her daily allowance plus the twelve percent made up out of his own share .", '" Hell , " muttered an exhausted voice , directed at nothing in particular - Kayla , his wife , in from sunside . She saw him and dimmed the lights again .', '" What \'s right ? " She stripped to her underwear , balling up her pants and hurling them in the corner . Even in the shadows , she looked as thin and tough as carbon-fiber cable . She was a few years older than Sue-sheila , a few years younger than Broadnax . " The solar scoops are all working again , but we had to rebuild one of the stabilizers . Not sure how long it \'ll           , " he said , nuzzling his daughter \'s tiny head again . The lights had n\'t bothered her . " Any word from Aeneas ? "', '" \' Lost , \' " Broadnax muttered , disbelieving .', '" What \'re they offering ? "', '" It \'s not worth it , " he said . " The goats do n\'t have milk right now anyway because their rations were cut way back . Bet it \'d take more to get them to produce than we \'d get in trade . "', 'She toweled off with her dirty shirt , tossed it down too , and glided over to the hammock . As she bent over , Broadnax lifted his head up to meet her . She leaned past him to kiss the baby . Lips pursed , she blew him a kiss as she stood up .', 'He twisted a second too late . " Wait - "', 'Kayla slammed the door and Maya jerked awake , big eyes darting around .', '" No , it \'s okay , " she said , exhaling . She cracked the door . " Sorry \' bout that , Trey . "           " Did n\'t mean to startle you . "', '" I stayed out here so I could tell you when you came in , " Broadnax said . " Instead of you walking right in on him sleeping in the hammock . Guess I fell asleep . "', '" Things ai n\'t no better on Callisto . "', "If they came . Broadnax did n't say that , though .", '" Yeah , I see it . " Her head sagged .', "Kayla climbed inside and rolled herself up in the blankets without talking to him , then buried her face in the pillow and pretended to be asleep . Maybe she already was . She 'd been tired constantly ever since having the baby . But things had been rough between them before that . Had always been rough .", "Huge fans rattled overhead , stirring the thin air and making him uncomfortable . Laughter echoed at the far end as a crew of Kayla 's coworkers came in from sunside maintenance and hurried downshaft . He could n't blame them . If the spin-gravity was low down deep , up here it was gee plus . But that was n't the only thing weighing on him .", 'She wore her usual clothes , blues and grays , nothing special Broadnax noticed about them . But she had scrubbed her skin until it gleamed and had glossed her lips with something . Even her computer monocle looked a little less dingy than normal .', '" No , you do . " He indicated the flextube . " Let \'s go .', 'He entered the craft , sphinctered the airlock shut , and hit the keys that undid the clamps . Sue-sheila waited nervously in the cramped middeck behind the seats .', '" Payload , " she said quickly . He gestured for her to take the seat slightly back and to the left . He ducked his head and squeezed into the right seat , loosely tucking the canister under the strap beside him .', '" Exchanged . "', '" Purged .

When she came to the end , he said , " You forgot to ask about food rations . "', '" Never is , but you always ask .

That \'s something you need to know . "', 'He commenced the launch sequence , counting down the final seconds aloud the way he learned as a kid . " Ten rings of Saturn , nine rings of Saturn , eight rings - "', 'He watched the rest of the ticks click away . The thrusters boosted and they lifted off . " Well , if I did that they might look for us back at a certain time , " he said . " Did you tell anyone where you were going ? "', '" I did n\'t tell anyone where you were going either . "', 'Sue-sheila pressed against the bugeye window , staring . When she noticed Broadnax noticing her , she leaned back in her seat and feigned boredom .', '" Oh , it \'s better than the hatchery . "', '" They let me pick out the new rooster , just before I left . " She leaned forward ,           know that \'s what roosters are called ? Cocks . "', '" So I got to pick the new cock . "', 'She stared at him waiting for more of a reaction , then leaned back in her seat and acted bored again . " Nah . We have to do it after so many generations just to keep genetic diversity in the fertile eggs . So we tested a bunch , found some males , and I picked one . "', '" Yeah ! " She snapped upright .

" Let me see you do the l-o-v-e s-l-i-d-e . "', 'IMG \n Any resemblance between new frontiers and old may be more than coincidence-and perhaps a bit silly !', 'It was a hell of a morning to be driving to the Moon . Wind howled and buffeted the car . Tree branches littered the streets and sheets of rain pelted my windshield like a shower head turned on full blast from six feet overhead . The predawn light provided barely enough visibility to dodge the occasional mad jogger and bicyclist . " This had better be important , Lester , " I murmured to myself while swerving to avoid the storm-amputated limb of an evergreen tree . " We work twelve hours a day , and then you wo n\'t even let me get four hours sleep without calling me back ! This had better be important-or I \'ll personally bury Pecos alive under a ton of regolith ! " Sipping my mocha , I steered my battered Toyota into the business park and pulled up to the Pegasus Lunar Mining Corporation suite . I flung open the door-and was startled to see Wendell Huston , CEO and founder of Pegasus , sprawled over the receptionist \'s desk .           head , and blinked . " Hello , Brian , " he said , and yawned . " Uh , hullo , Wendell , " I said . " Uh , what are you doing here , this time of morning ? " " Morning ? It \'s morning ? " Wendell checked the computer screen . " Man , I must have dozed off . I was reviewing the budget and-well , long story short , you and Lester had better find a strike quick , or we \'re going to be hurting . " Through the office entrance \'s glass door I could see a sticker in the corner of my windshield saying I needed an oil change six months ago . My two hundred thousand shares of Pegasus common stock would n\'t even buy me that . Wendell was n\'t telling me anything new . " Well , " I said , preparing to skip through a verbal minefield , " the latest drill samples look promising . " " That \'s what Lester was- " " Brian ! " Lester Kim hissed my name as only           so quietly neither of us had noticed . " It \'s about time you showed up ! " he bellowed . " I need you in Ops-right now ! " Wendell straightened , the grogginess melted away . " You \'ve made a strike ? " " Uh . . . no . " Lester shoved back his hair , badly in need of a trim , and studied the floor . " It \'s more of an , uh , equipment problem . " " Oh . " The grogginess-and about ten more years-returned to Wendell \'s face . " Well , good luck fixing it . Let me know how it goes . " " Brian . " Lester looked at me . " Please ? " I drained my cup and tossed it in the trash . And okay , it was childish , but I stomped after Lester into the Operations Room . While I shed my threadbare overcoat and brushed off the raindrops , Lester shut the door and met my glare with his own . " I told you this was urgent , and           also stopped for a " Help Wanted " sign in a drug store window . " I plopped in a chair and slumped . " God , Lester , when will this end ? I \'m behind in my rent , they \'re threatening to deactivate my cell phone , and that mocha blew my weekly breakfast budget . And you want me to spend my life here ! Frankly , I \'d rather enjoy a real life on this world than some cowboy fantasy on another- " " Someone was snooping in camp last night . " I had n\'t enough sleep , and it was too early for a sledgehammer . " Huh ? " " See for yourself . " Lester motioned toward VR Workstation 1 . I sighed , and strapped into its sensory feedback devices : the seat that bucked and swiveled , the gloves that provided tactile stimuli , the VR helmet that immersed our audio-visual senses . Lester rolled over to Workstation 2 , a motorized tilting platform adapted to his wheelchair . We slipped our helmets over our eyes . Desktop icons           gloved hand and touched the square labeled Lunar Prospector 3.0 . The VR gloves tweaked with a pulsed feedback , and the window interface opened . Wedged between the menu and task bars of a typical computer application was a scene of barren , cratered plains , beneath a black , star-powdered sky-with Earth glowing just above the horizon in the northeast . When I turned my head , the lunarscape turned with me . When I raised an arm , a mechanical claw rose into view . When I pressed a foot pedal , I felt the bumps and jolts of motion . All of this sensory experience is courtesy of Lunar Rover UN Registry WL65I-affectionately known as " Wiley . " Wiley is a robot the size of a toaster oven and lives on the Moon . He has wheels for locomotion , claws for grasping , and camera eyes for vision . Wiley \'s telemetry signal travels over the Clavius Impact Basin regional cell phone network in the southwestern quadrant of the lunar near side , to an Earth-Moon radio communications system , to the terrestrial Internet           a business park on Earth . Wiley does n\'t think ; I do that for him . Wiley inputs sensory data into my VR equipment , and I command him the same way . Wiley is pretty cool as alter egos go , and I like him . But unlike Lester , who is a VR fanatic , I can never forget I \'m in that business park . The Apollo astronauts gazed over the lunar horizon at Earth and experienced a cosmic paradigm shift . I see the same view through Wiley \'s high-definition camera lenses and still worry about my rent . I was contemplating my lack of emotional immersion , when something entered Wiley \'s field of vision . Another rover , a six-wheeled foot-and-a-halfer , trundled around a rock and approached . The rover was identical to Wiley , except the front registration label read PK23S-and the camera mounting wore a sombrero . It was Lester \'s rover , " Pecos , " and it was a full-size sombrero . The camera pylon rose , and the sombrero rose as well . The sombrero turned as           registered Lester \'s voice : " It \'s in the lab . Come on . " Lester rotated a one-eighty and Pecos-the-Rover headed toward camp . Lester \'s rover was n\'t faster than mine , but there \'s a three-second signal delay while electromagnetic waves dash between Moon and Earth and back , so he got a considerable distance ahead and reached the nearest hill before I even started moving . I followed across the gray-green plains of craters and dust beneath a black sky . Entering our mining camp , we wended through the late lunar afternoon shadows cast by drills , carts , and our other prospecting gear which had been hauled up at enormous price from Earth ( or manufactured on the Moon at **27;1613;TOOLONG price ) . Lester \'s rover bee-lined toward a prism-shaped tent . I rolled in after . On the low table within lay row and column of slug-like lunar drilling samples . Neatly labeled and organized , they represented six months of searching for a palladium-rich fragment of the primordial asteroid that created the Clavius Impact Basin . " What \'s the           place . " " Look harder . I \'ll wait . " Lester \'s rover picked up a cord and twirled a lasso . That \'s difficult to do on the Moon in spite of the lower gravity , because of the signal delay . Lester practices all the time , and he \'s good . Extending my claw , I yanked the cord away . " Do n\'t play games , Lester . Now , what makes you think a spy was here ? " " Wheel prints . " I tilted my head down . Wiley did likewise , and I saw what Wiley saw : a crisscross of rover wheel prints imprinted on the moon dust . The vast majority of the prints were three inches wide , and had a v-mark in the center . They were our wheel prints . Then I noticed the new wheel prints . These were only an inch wide , and spaced four inches apart-a third of Wiley \'s wheelbase . There was no v-mark . " Oh , " I said . " Did you check the security cam           followed the prints ? " " I figured we \'d do that together . Safety in numbers . " He exited the tent . I caught up , and we set off toward a nearby hill , following the wavering parallel lines of the intruder \'s wheel prints in the steeply slanted sunlight of the final earthday of the two-week lunar daytime . We topped the hill , descended into a valley , and ascended another hill . A human being would barely notice the gentle lunar slopes , but our camera lenses were mere inches off the ground , and it was like riding through canyons . All the while , I felt watching eyes . " Do you see now , " Lester said , " why I wanted a gun ? " " Whatever we \'re following is n\'t much bigger than a pocket calculator , Lester . We do n\'t need a gun , we need a fly swatter . " The wheel prints abruptly ended , obliterated by larger prints-much larger prints . They were tractor tracks , not wheels , and as wide as           our human bodies as well as our minuscule rovers . An untutored investigator might look at the prints and conclude the big rover ran over the small one . We \'d seen this trick before , however . " Our spy hitched a ride , " Lester observed . " And you know there \'s only one rover that big . " I bobbed Wiley \'s camera mounting . " Bartholomew Palladium Consortium Excavator Number One . " Lester \'s rover nodded back . " Yep . Big Bart himself . " My mind and my future were both cloudy . " We should tell Wendell . " " Wendell \'s a great entrepreneur , Brian , but his talent is talking to potential investors and raising funds . His idea of action here will be to send a strongly worded e-mail to the UN bureaucracy . " Lester gets bombastic at times , but for once I could see his point . " So what do you suggest ? " I asked . " We go into Clavius Gulch , " he replied , " and talk to the           Station , and talk to the United Nations Lunar Policy Enforcement Representative . " " Sheesh , Brian ! Everyone here calls it Clavius Gulch , and everyone calls him the sheriff . Why ca n\'t you deal with that ? " I tapped one claw with the other . " One : I am never going to wear a cowboy hat on my rover . Two : I am never going to speak Old West Lingo . \' " I planted my claws against my sides . " We \'re here to make money , not play games . " The sombrero swiveled back and forth . " Brian , you may not like the " lingo , " but here \'s my assessment of the situation : Big Bart \'s gang is claim-jumping . The sheriff needs to round up a posse and bring them to justice-or else , as you would put it , we wo n\'t " make money . " Now , aside from terminology , do you have any objection to what I \'m saying ? " I thought about it , then sighed           robot \'s got to do what a robot \'s got to do . " " I swear , his rover gave me a wounded look . We left camp down a well-worn trail and traversed barren plains whose sterility would have intimidated any pioneer of yore . Of course , seeing Earth hanging in the sky ( and " upside down , " no less ) would n\'t have helped much in the sanity department , either . Eventually , a hand-made , hand-painted sign appeared : CLAVIUS GULCH POP . 102 Clavius Station is a few blocks of slapdash buildings built on rover-scale so that most are no bigger than a bedroom in an earthside home . Yet no matter how puny the warehouse , shop , or store , every third establishment has the word " Emporium " in its name . The unlighted streets , as dusty as anywhere else on the Moon , were thronged with microrovers like our own , nearly all of them wearing cowboy hats . At the patch of pavement loftily called a " spaceport , " a robotic lunar lander ,           module that had once transported humans to the Moon , was being offloaded by stevedore microbots . Other rovers , towing covered wagons , carried freight between spaceport and warehouses and the outlying mining camps that dot the Clavius Impact Basin . The center of town is dominated by a ten-meter tall spire , the space gun . We paused at the top of the hill to watch the load and launch operation . The spire tilted from near vertical to horizontal , pointing due northeast , down the length of Main Street . Bots stuffed refined palladium and a locator beacon into an artillery shell , then ramrodded the shell into the muzzle . The cylinder elevated again , until it targeted Earth . A robot at the space gun control panel pressed the firing button , which breaks the diaphragm between the pressurized gas tank and the discharge cylinder . The muzzle puffed vapor . The shell exited at lunar escape velocity-a mile and a half per second , too fast to see except on slow motion instant replay . Wiley \'s interface software has that feature ,           from the space gun into the sky , coursing from Moon to Earth , a Jules-Verneian tale in reverse . The shell was bound for the shallow coral beds north of Australia , where a teleoperated minisub would retrieve the palladium payload four days later . From there the metal would find its way into a few of the quarter billion or so personal computer motherboards built annually on Earth . Palladium , precious as gold , was at the zenith of historical demand , rendering lunar mining a practical business proposition . " Someone \'s making money , " I said , watching the gun lower again . " Or is " profit " too crass for your idealism ? " Lester shook his rover \'s head . " I only wish more of us were getting rich . But they need to clean up this town before that happens . " We rolled down the hill , past the graveyard of derelict rovers on Cemetery Hill , and drove among the collection of dilapidated structures that the locals called Clavius Gulch . Several robotic citizens tilted their hats           my rover . " Hello , Pecos , " they said to Lester \'s . We knew them by their rover names too-Slim and Tiny and Big Red and Diamond Jim and Chester . The Moon \'s " population " is so small that everyone knows everyone , almost . " The UN rep \'s name is Laszlo , right ? " I asked . " Yep , " Brian replied . " Sheriff Laszlo . " " Laszlo does n\'t sound like a Western-style nickname . " " Nope . I hear he \'s a post-retirement civil servant , telecommuting from his personal computer somewhere in Southeastern Europe . The way his rover moves , he \'s either drunk or connected by phone modem . " " You doubt he \'ll help much . " " Yup . At least meeting him face to face will get more action than e-mail . " I steered toward the earthsky-blue globe of the UN office , but Lester deflected us toward a nearer , larger structure-with a giant neon-colored sign blazing in Mesquite font : MARLENA \'S PLACE LUBRICANTS OF ALL           Lester said . " Of course , " I replied . " The wellspring of lunar lunacy . " " Brian , when are you going to get in the spirit ? " " When it pays my rent , Lester . " We rode up the ramp in front of Marlena \'s Place . Lester raised his claws and pushed open the swinging doors , and we entered the " barroom " . What we heard when we passed through the doors was the jangle of player piano music and a half dozen conversations roaring at once from the tables , where prospecting rovers sporting cowboy hats , bandannas , and firearms sucked on lubrication canisters doled out by tiny spider bots . All of the nonsquelching voices and sound effects in hard lunar vacuum were courtesy of radio transmitters placed about the room and the Sonic Simulation Channel signal-integration subroutines of our Lunar Prospector 3.0 software-which also registered a crash when a lubricant cylinder fell off a waiter \'s tray behind us ( do n\'t ask me how LP 3.0 does that ; I think it has something           ) . Forced by company rules to continuously monitor vehicles whose construction and transport to the lunar surface cost millions of dollars , the human rover operators found diversions while their rovers were being serviced : an argumentative poker game in the corner , a European-style cabaret playing on a wall screen that to a microrover seemed as big as a theater stage . All in all , Marlena \'s is a pretty elaborate set-up for what is essentially the lunar equivalent of an automobile lube shop . " Hello , boys , can I help you ? " The sultry voice came from behind . We turned and Lester tilted his sombrero to a rover with a sleek , silver chassis adorned with jewels and pearl beads , and crowned by a towering lace headdress . " Howdy , Miss Marlena , " Lester said . " You \'re looking lovely today , as always ! " " Pecos , it \'s always good to see you ! " gushed the proprietress of the lubrication bar as her claw patted the side of Lester \'s robot . The deep           brought Mr. Wiley T. Wet-Blanket with you . " " Brian will behave today . " " If he does , I \'ll give him a custom hat for free . " Her camera mounting nodded toward nearby shelves , where several cowboy hats rested , everything from sombreros to Texan ten-gallons . Marlena makes the headgear herself : metal frames covered with fabrics grown in a hydroponics garden . Legend has it , in the early days of the Palladium Rush , she handed out hats to everyone who walked in her doors , which is how the whole lunar-cowboy fed got started . By the time I came along , though , she was charging a pretty price , and although I could understand that the cost was justified because it was timeconsuming to handcraft a hat using robot manipulators ( with that aggravating time lag no less ! ) , I saw no reason to waste money on something that is basically useless . Constantly being ribbed as " The Man With No Hat " made me all the more determined to remain hatless . " We           " Is he here ? " Marlena sighed and shrugged her manipulators , and pointed a silver claw toward the end of the bar . Mesmerized by the floorshow , nursing a mini-can of lubricant , was a dirty , banged-up rover . A UN badge dangled loosely on the foreplate . " Been there for hours , " Marlena said . " All he does is mope about how he ca n\'t do anything , he does n\'t have the authority . The so-called law in these parts ! " Laszlo was oblivious to our approach . I saw his laser on the floor , fallen from its holster . Lester touched the sheriff \'s chassis . Dusty lenses surveyed us like we were a pair of rattlesnakes . " Pecos , Wiley , " a quavering voice said . " What do you want ? " " Someone broke into our camp , Sheriff , " Lester said . " They went into our lab and looked at our drilling samples . We think they plan to jump our claim . " Laszlo \'s claw trembled as he           Rumor had it that rover and operator alike were heavy partakers of their respective lubricants . A lot of folks thought Laszlo was a do-nothing placeholder in a figurehead job . Maybe he \'d heard , and it was getting to him . " Any idea who it was ? " Laszlo asked . " A microrover in Big Bart \'s gang , " I replied . " Big-Bart ! " His radio-transmitted voice bellowed across the room . Conversations fell silent and every pair of eyes ( and the single belonging to One-Eyed Jack ) turned on us . A small blurry shape darted to the entrance . It slipped through the gap beneath the doors before I could turn , but Laszlo had zoomed in . " Oh God , " he said . " That \'s one of his boys . We \'ve got to get out of here- " Laszlo hobbled from the bar , dragging the tubing and canister with him . Lester latched onto the badge . " Sheriff , " Lester said , " do n\'t tell me you \'re going to run           a world government ! " " Sorry-wrong world ! " He batted Lester away and retreated . Lester snapped a grip on the sheriff \'s camera mounting and brought his lenses and the sheriff \'s within inches . " Listen , we have property rights under UN edict , and you have to enforce them . What do you think we pay UN licensing fees for ? " " So the UN will leave you alone , " Laszlo replied . " What , you want the UN to police the Moon ? It can barely police Earth ! " Lester \'s arms flailed up and down like that old robot on Lost in Space . " You \'ve got to do something ! " " I am ! I \'m getting out of here before Big Bart comes-and I \'d advise you to do the same ! " Too late . We all saw the lube cans jiggling from the floor vibration . Everyone turned toward the entrance . The doors flew wide and darkness blotted the sunlight , blocking the doors open . It was so huge ,           tracks instead of wheels , and spikes bristling atop slabs of armor plating . Its jet-black finish gleamed beneath the chandelier . Bulging compound lenses swept the barroom . The eyes trained on the three puny rovers in the back , and glowed red . The massive excavator machine barely cleared the ceiling of Marlena \'s barroom-the biggest room in Clavius Gulch-as it plowed aside tables and chairs and rolled toward us . In truth it may have been only the size of a subcompact automobile , but to our beady little robot eyes , it bulked like a main-battie tank . The intervening prospectors scooped up lube cans and poker chips , and vamoosed . Laszlo shrank into the corner , trembling . Lester and I stood frozen . The wall of black armor stopped , and grapefruit-sized eyes glared from a height our fully extended manipulators could not reach . " WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT ME ? " The grill beneath the eyes flickered with the words , which boomed with a gravely deep , electronically distorted rumble . I had never seen Big Bart           I saw the claws , and dully realized that they were big enough to snap poor little Wiley in two . " Now , uh-Bart , Big Bart , " Laszlo injected , " the boys here were only saying that someone broke into their camp , and- " " AND THEY THINK I DID IT ? " Banks of blood-red running lights flickered across his plates , stroking faster and faster . If it was done for intimidation , it worked . Okay , so none of us were actually in that room , and it was n\'t like Bart could send an electrical shock down our comm links and zap us . But if he smashed our uninsured rovers , Pegasus Lunar Mining Corp . would be out of business . Plus , Big Bart looks like he comes from the same planet as the alien that pops out of the guy \'s stomach and eats everyone but Sigourney Weaver . Experiencing that through a high-def VR interface is more than enough to have the hackles on your backside do stretching exercises . " Now , now ,           \'s voice sounded like he needed to take his own advice . " I-I did n\'t say you did anything . And they did n\'t say you did anything- " " No ! " Lester shouted . " As a matter of fact , we do say ! " The little prospector rover \'s cameras tilted as far back as they could go , meeting the giant excavator \'s gaze . " You sent a microrover to spy on us ! " Lester said . " It left wheel prints all over our camp . " Pecos lowered its lenses toward Big Bart \'s side compartment door . " I bet you \'re carrying the microrover right now ! " Big Bart stared at Lester . The room was silent , but for a chorus of static-the electromagnetic whine of a dozen rover motors racing for the door . Big Bart chuckled . Then his bulging right arm swung back , a batter tensed for the swing . " Lester ! " I shouted . The whip-fast claw smashed into Pecos . The little rover flew over the bar and           . Shards of glass stabbed the lubrication canisters on the shelves , squirting black rain over the furniture , floor , and us . The chandelier , struck by stray debris , swung like a pendulum , rocking our shadows . Laszlo finally broke from paralysis . He fumbled over his holster , saw the gun on the floor , and grabbed it . Big Bart intently watched-like he was curious to see whether the sheriff had the guts . To my surprise , Laszlo did . The sheriff repeat-fired , batteries tumbling out of their chambers . A blinding flash hit Bart \'s left eye , another the right . The last of the single-shot battery cartridges hit the floor and electrical discharges stopped pzzzting , but Laszlo spasmodically kept yanking the trigger . Visors had slipped over Big Bart \'s eyes the instant Laszlo started shooting . Bart snatched Laszlo \'s gun and the immense claws crumpled it like a tube of toothpaste . Then he pressed in , looming over the sheriff . A graceful , delicate silver appendage chopped in between . " What the hell           small chassis , such a big transmitter ! I almost tore off the earphones . Even Big Bart flinched-a little . " No more fighting ! " Marlena glared at Big Bart . " The Shopowner \'s Association will hear of this ! If you do n\'t want to personally haul all your parts and supplies from Earth , I suggest you leave now ! " Big Bart \'s battle-eyes scanned her without expression . He still had a claw raised , and Marlena lay within its swing . They stood rock still , gazes locked . Bart \'s claw lowered . The big rover backed off , turned , and lumbered through the lubricant-slicked room and among the broken furniture and out the doorway , prying a door off its hinges while squeezing through . " And this damage is going on your tab ! " Marlena barked after him . I rushed to the bar and looked over . Pecos lay upside down . All his indicator lights were dark . " Lester , " I said . " Are you all right ? " No reply .           helmet . His motion-feedback platform was skewed seventy degrees . Lester was sprawled on the floor of the Ops Room , his wheelchair overturned . Before the morning ended , we told Wendell . He was understandably upset , but did n\'t chide . Summoning us to the conference room , he put the company lawyer on the speakerphone . The conversation did n\'t go as envisioned . " I do n\'t understand , " Wendell said . " How did they get to be the injured party ? " " I \'m not saying they are the injured party , " the lawyer replied . " But it is quite possible that Bartholomew Palladium Consortium will see it that way . " " Their guy hit me ! " Lester blared . " There were witnesses ! " " You mean , their robot struck your robot with an appendage . They could claim it was merely an electronic malfunction . " " Ca n\'t they be held legally responsible for damages caused by malfunctions ? " Lester demanded . " What \'s tangible here , " the lawyer           " is that you made certain remarks that defame the corporate character of BPC . You publicly accused them of criminality without evidence to substantiate . " " They left wheel prints all over our camp , " I said . " Easily fabricated . And my guess is they will claim that . " Lester opened his mouth , but Wendell waved him down . " So what is our legal game plan ? " Wendell asked the speaker box . " Wait and hope they do n\'t file a defamation of character suit . If they do , we settle out of court . " " But we \'re in the right ! " Lester cried . " Lester ! " Wendell paused . " Pegasus ca n\'t afford a protracted legal battle . " " Bartholomew can , " added the lawyer . " They have more attorneys than Pegasus has employees . They even have a Congressional lobbyist . Face it , we \'re outgunned . " Lester slammed the tabletop . " This is n\'t right ! This is n\'t fair ! " " If           to suggest , " said the lawyer , " I \'m willing to listen . " Outside the window it was still raining , a miserable drizzle that might last days , weeks , eons . Wendell thanked our attorney and said good-bye . Then his eyes gave us their full attention . " Lester , the man \'s doing the best he can . " " Where \'s the justice , Wendell ? " " Justice is an intriguing concept-but what \'s it have to do with the law ? " When Lester said nothing , Wendell continued : " Everyone knows the legal system is a crapshoot these days . People can bankrupt you with a lawsuit over slipping on the sidewalk outside your office . Megacorporations can rob you blind and toss you in jail for complaining about them . You have to know when to play and when to fold . This is folding time . " Lester brushed back his hair . " Is this how we serve the shareholders , by giving up ? " From his pocket , Wendell produced his key chain           at the center . The little ball spun in the fluorescent light and twinkled rainbow sparkles like miniature stars . The curvature of the glass magnified the speck within , which glinted with hues of blue and green of an ocean that never was . " You know what this is , " Wendell said . " Your " Moon rock , " " Lester replied . " Yes , I must have shown it a thousand times in a thousand investment presentations during our start-up capitalization phase . " A trace of a smile passed over Wendell \'s lips . " I bought it when I was still in grad school , not much older than you two . The first private-enterprise lunar probe had returned from the Moon with a kilo of lunar dust . Back then , we did n\'t have the space gun , and lunar samples came back via expendable rocket , and the rockets and their fuel had to come from Earth-all very , very expensive . So at the time , this speck was so rare it cost me half a semester \'s           , I saw the destiny of the human race in space colonization , in spreading life to other worlds . To me , this dust particle was a seed , and it represented our first steps toward a glorious future . " First we \'d send mining robots . The profits would go to build more economical rockets , to carry bigger mining robots . Eventually , the rockets would be big enough to send human space pioneers . Then , the dream could begin . " " We \'ve all seen your charts and trend lines , " Lester said . " My point is , " Wendell said tersely , " Bartholomew Consortium is trampling my dream . The consortium exists for one purpose only-to keep the global palladium market from being flooded by cheap lunar palladium . Well , they tried fair competition with us entrepreneurial lunar mining companies , and they did n\'t succeed . They tried buyouts-and for every company they bought , two more sprang up , so that did n\'t succeed . They went to the government and tried to regulate us out           they did n\'t succeed . They \'ve dumped palladium and driven the market price below sustainable levels , but we \'re still in business , barely , and so they \'re still not successful . So now they \'re going broke themselves , and they \'re desperate . " They \'ll do anything to shut down the Moon . They do n\'t care if it means the end of the Space Age and the last , best hope of mankind to get off this planet . I ca n\'t fathom their materialism and greed , but there it is . " So I \'m no apologist for Bartholomew , Lester . I just want you to trust that I \'m doing all that can be done to preserve a dream that is sacred to both of us . " I squirmed in my chair . Wendell , fortyish , flabby , and balding , still had the power to convey his vision of teleoperated robots leading to real human space colonization-and to make space colonization seem the most important achievement the human race would ever accomplish . He had charmed           me out of a career in corporate finance to come drive a toy robot around an airless desert . At that moment , caught between Wendell the Evangelist and Lester the Zealot , part of me wanted to walk out the door and never come back-before their insanity infected my heart and soul again . I did n\'t need to worry about humanity \'s fate just then . I needed to worry about the fate of my phone bill . Lester looked at Wendell for a long time . Then he shook his head . " I \'m not sure I can trust you on that , Wendell . " Wrong thing to say , I thought , watching Wendell suppress a frown . " All right then , " Wendell said , slapping the table a little too hard . " But I \'m in charge and we \'ll do it my way . Get your robot repaired-and you will steer clear of BPC from now on . In particular , stay away from that excavator unit of theirs . All right ? " After a skimpy lunch ,           , still parked in the saloon . The lubricant had been mopped up and the furniture moved back in place . A metal plate barricaded the street entrance . The barroom was deserted . " Marlena ? " I called . " Inhere ! " The Sonic Simulation Channel made it sound like her voice was coming from the doorway at the end of the bar . I rolled into a back room . Pecos , still inert , was righted on a bench , his slightly rumpled sombrero fastened in place . His left side was marred by a dent and scrapes . His access panel was open , and a rover wearing a black bowler hat was poking around my partner \'s innards . Marlena hovered nearby , and nodded to me . She gestured to the rover with the bowler . " You know Doc . " I scanned Lester \'s rover . " How is he , Doc ? " " Seen better , " Doc replied . He reached into his little black bag , extracted a soldering iron , and probed the hole in           He \'s got an alignment problem in his number three wheel axis , and to fix that I \'ll need him on the rack at my place . " I shook Wiley \'s head . " We ca n\'t afford major repairs . We \'ll just have to live with it . " Doc withdrew the iron tip . " Maybe , before we go any further , we should discuss the small matter of payment for this call- " Before I could speak , Marlena intervened : " I \'ll cover it . Just get this rover out of here , Doc . Dead patrons are bad for business . " Doc went back to work , with two spectators now . Finally , my conscience won over my annoyance , and I said , " Thanks , Marlena . I appreciate this , and I know Lester does especially . " " " Especially , " " she said . " You said that because he \'s in a wheelchair . " My unseen face reddened . " Yeah . " " Well , I suppose we all           the Moon instead of dealing with real people on Earth . " " I \'m incredibly ugly , " I joked ( I hope ) . " That \'s my limitation . What \'s yours ? " " I \'m four foot one . " It took me a moment to realize she did n\'t mean her rover \'s dimensions . " Not that it \'s really a handicap like what Lester has , " she continued . " I can walk just fine . My car is modified so I can drive it . I never feel cramped in an airline seat . " I smiled , and wished she could see it . " But , " she continued , her mechanical arms hinting at a shrug , " it \'s hard to be taken seriously when you \'re standing in a nineteen inch hole . " For a brief moment , 1 thought I understood her at last . But when I thought further about it , she still did n\'t make sense .... " So now that you \'re taken seriously , " I said ,           hat ? " She laughed . " Brian , sometimes having fun is the most serious thing you can do . " " There , " Doc said . " That should do it . " He nudged in a circuit card , and Pecos \'s indicator lights blinked on . " Hey ! " Lester \'s voice exclaimed . The response was immediate ; he \'d been sitting at his workstation , attempting to reestablish a comm link from his end . " I \'m back ! " " I saw how hard you hit that mirror , and you \'re very lucky , " Doc replied , snapping his bag shut . " If you ca n\'t afford my repair bills , I \'d advise you not to get into any more fights . " He tipped his hat to Marlena and bade us good day , and she let him out through the back door . Then it was just die three of us . " Lester , what were you thinking ? " I demanded . " Well , I did n\'t think he \'d attack           would have torn the sheriff apart , too , if Marlena had n\'t stepped in . " " I doubt I stopped him for long , " Marlena said . " Characters like Big Bart do n\'t sit well with backing down from confrontations . " " So what can we do ? " I asked . " The law wo n\'t help . " " Earth law , you mean , " Marlena said . " We have to make our own law here . " " Yeah , " said Lester . " Get a posse , and round up Big Bart and lois whole gang ! " He \'s become a parrot , I thought . " Get a posse , awk , awk , get a posse ? " " A posse is n\'t enough , " Marlena replied . " UN jurisdiction courts would probably refuse to hear the case-or they \'d let Bartholomew loose on a technicality . " Her lenses zoomed on infinity . " What we need here is a revolution . " Napoleon Complex , I reflexively thought . " What           do we declare independence from Earth when we \'re still physically living there ? " " I \'m not saying we declare independence . I \'m saying we set up a vigilante committee to mete out frontier justice . " I scratched the top of Wiley \'s casing . " Vigilante , frontier justice ... why do n\'t I feel comfortable with those terms ? " " Because , " Marlena said , " you associate them with ignorant , dangerous rednecks . But those are precisely the kind of people that vigilante committees were formed to protect the public from . In the Old West , when a town government got too corrupt and ineffectual , the people would hold a meeting and elect new law enforcement officials . Well , we need to do the same . If we conduct this right , it \'ll be Jeffersonian democracy in action . " She sounded like a history buff . Maybe Napoleon would have met his match in Marlena . I know I was beginning to feel overwhelmed . " Jeffersonian democracy , " I said . " Is           Thomas Jefferson think of teleoperated robots on the Moon ? " " He \'d know , " Marlena calmly replied , " that you ca n\'t adjudicate bar brawls from a courtroom a quarter million miles away . " I \'m certainly no history buff , and for all I knew , she was spinning this politicalscience discourse from thin air . And maybe she could get the rest of the town to buy into her brand of frontier justice , just like she had them going along with the silly hats and the hokey slang . But as for me , I had a flash of practical insight that cut through the philosophical crud : like everything else that had happened today , this conversation was n\'t paying the rent . " We \'re in enough trouble without getting crucified as rebels , " I said . To Lester , I added : " Come on , " pardner , " I " reckon " it \'s about time we " mosey " on back to camp . " Marlena made a noise that sounded like a growl .           had to stop and wait outside the saloon . It was the top of the hour , and the space gun , in horizontal configuration , fired a test shell down the length of Main Street at the Calibration Target Monolith on the edge of town . Despite the wait , neither of us said anything . When the all-clear bell sounded , traffic resumed , and we steered up Cemetery Hill Drive with the Sun in our eyes . Pecos , limping from the warp in his wheel axis , kept pace as we passed the city limits and rejoined the camp trail . " You think she \'s wrong , " Lester said . " About the revolution thing . " " Let \'s put this in perspective , " I said . " We \'re robots the size of poodles . That \'s on the Moon . On Earth , it \'s worse . We \'re entry-level employees in a faltering startup venture . We \'re not in a position to start a revolution . The way it looks to me , Marlena \'s solution to a           century . So instead of the Wild West in 1876 , it \'s now the American Revolution in 1776 . Hang around long enough , and she \'ll have us quoting Shakespeare and wearing codpieces . But all her fantasies have done is get your rover busted up . " He did n\'t speak for the rest of the trip . Maybe , for that brief spell , I was getting through . Then we reached the last hill . And saw fresh wheel prints . Big prints . " He \'s been here , " Lester croaked . Spinning dust , he charged up the hill . I followed as fast as I could . At the top , we skidded to a halt and beheld the camp . Or what remained of it . Lester broke the silence : " No ! No ! No ! " We raced down . A hurricane had descended upon the Moon : tents flattened , tanks punctured , the analyzer smashed , the drill rig missing , pipes bent , solar panels cracked . And everywhere those hideous huge prints-of tractor           No ! " Pecos pounded the ground , gouging new craters . " We \'re out of business , " I mumbled . Not next month , not next week . Pegasus Lunar Mining was for all practical intents and purposes out of business as of that very moment . Our working assets were destroyed and we had no insurance to cover the damage . Who needs insurance on the Moon ? No floods , no fires , no storms , a major moonquake is a minor earthquake-and significant meteor impacts happen once a millennium . Vandalism and theft ? The Moon has only ladies and gentlemen ... right ? Pecos scanned the dust for solar ionization build-up , which detects how recently regolith has been exposed to sunlight . " These wheel prints are fresh . If we go right now , we might be able to catch them . " Instead of immediately following the prints , however , Lester grabbed a shovel , rolled over to an outcropping of rocks , and started digging . " What are you doing ? " I asked . " Getting           . He dropped the shovel and reached into the hole , withdrawing a metal pipe with a bulge at one end-and a trigger in the middle . " What is that ? " I asked . " Guess . " " Lester ! " " Brian , it \'s my own property . I bought it from the blacksmith , with what I made helping at the spaceport after hours . So it \'s mine and I \'m going to use it . " Company management surely would n\'t appreciate Lester moonlighting ( or would you call it earthlighting ? ) at the spaceport with its rover , but before I could lecture , Pecos bolted off , hot on the trail . " You \'re acting crazy ! " " Tell me what we \'ve got to lose ! " I chased over hills , valleys , and plains of chalky lunar dust . Big Bart \'s prints wound back into Clavius Gulch . Lester barreled down Cemetery Hill Drive onto Main Street , waving his weapon above his sombrero , and the rovers scattered . He stopped and           Simulation Channel dead quiet . The late afternoon Sun cast steep , black shadows . I half expected a tumbleweed to roll by . " Bart ! " Lester shouted over the SSC . " Come out here , Bart ! " He launched into a string of profanities , using every entry in the modern database . We might have been the only rovers in town for all the reaction . Lester exhausted his vocabulary and breathed hard . I thought he was done . Then , he bellowed throatity : " Big Bart-you low-down , good-for-nothing cowardly jackass ! You \'re nothing but a snake . You hear me , Big Bart ? You hear me ? Nothing but a filthy , yellow-bellied , stinking snake ! " I wondered what Lester was doing-until I realized that Big Bart , like me , did n\'t wear a cowboy hat . Lester was assuming that the robot \'s teleoperator found " Old West lingo " as grating as I did . Lester continued : " And you know what else , Big Bart ? You \'re worse than a           " Light beams flashed , from the intersection two blocks ahead . A hulking black crab on tank tracks trundled onto Main and confronted us , headlamps blazing and claws snapping . It stampeded toward Lester . Feeling my courage melt , I retreated to an alley . Lester remained dead center in the street . " Yeeeee-baaaw ! " he yelled . He aimed his gun and pulled the trigger . The pipe tip puffed-and a spark flew off Big Bart \'s hide . The crab kept charging . Lester fired again , and again . Bart closed within fifty feet , thirty , twenty . He abruptly stopped . He remained still , while sparks glanced off his armor and Lester ran out of bullets . Centered above Big Bart \'s eyes , a circular door opened in the Neanderthal forehead . A barrel ten times the caliber in Lester \'s claw emerged . It tilted down to point straight at Lester \'s rover . It spat flame . Pecos exploded . Rover fragments and sombrero shreds rained upon the street . Before Big Bart turned , I           of Earth , Wendell invited Lester and me into the conference room once more . Pegasus Lunar Mining \'s chief executive officer listened quietly as Lester and I described the events since our last meeting . He did n\'t frown or shout , he did n\'t run about . He doodled circles on his scratch pad and asked questions in monotone . After our answers , he \'d nod , the only indication he was listening . Lester concluded our tale , and Wendell doodled in silence , the circles in tighter coils . It was rush hour , and traffic noises rumbled through the windows . A car belonging to someone in the neighboring insurance office splashed through puddles in the parking lot , the sound of someone with a real job going home to a real life . I felt a chill around my ankles from a draft , and wondered why the thermostat was turned so low . Then Wendell dropped the bomb and everything heated up . " I \'m sorry , Lester , " Wendell said . " We \'ll have to let you go           It \'s not his fault our camp was destroyed ! " " Lester twice provoked BPC , " Wendell said . " And the second time was in direct disobedience to my instructions . Regardless of whose fault it is , we \'ve lost millions of dollars in irreplaceable assets from the incidents . I can not go back to investors and ask for more funding without them asking if this is going to happen again . They \'ll want disciplinary action . " He slashed an X through the circles , his only show of emotion . He raised blank eyes to Lester and said , " Lester , clean out your desk . I want you out of here today . You \'ll receive two weeks " severance , of course . " I almost laughed . Did you have to quit to get paid around here ? Lester \'s face , though , quenched any humor . He backed away from the table , turned , and rolled out the door without a word . I followed him to the office spaces , reduced since the last           already at his desk , yanking out the drawers and stuffing his personal items into a cardboard box . There was surprisingly little , for someone who almost lived at work . " You . . . want to go somewhere . . . and talk ? " " Let me think this through on my own , first . " " Will you be all right ? " " No . " " Let \'s talk later , okay ? " He never returned my gaze . He put on his jacket and gloves , and rolled toward the door with the box in his lap . Outside , he erected his umbrella . I watched him roll down the ramp , elevate into his van , and drive off without signaling to merge onto the busy arterial . I stood at the receptionist \'s desk and felt my stomach churning . Lester had been fired for insubordination . If I kept my nose clean , I might last a month more until the company acknowledged financial reality and closed doors , and as a parting gift I \'d           at another lunar mining company . Only , Big Bart was making sure there were n\'t any more jobs or companies like that . What did we have to lose ? After dinner , I tried calling Lester . He did n\'t answer . I wandered in the local library and the shopping mall , and then I drove by the office . It was funny : after so many months of wishing for free time , that evening I felt like there was nowhere else I wanted to go . The lights were out and the door was locked , but I had a key ( Wendell often referred to me as " The Responsible One " ) . I sat in my cubicle chair and swiveled around , looking at the space posters on the walls and thinking about how all these landscapes photographed by robot eyes might never be seen by human ones . It was as if we said , Space is too tough for us , and we surrendered exploration of the universe to the robots . Now it was as if we were deciding           Though in this case , we humans had brought the menacing monster along with us from Earth-where we ourselves had constructed it . The fault lies not in the stars ... indeed , our flaws as a species could well keep us from the stars . Out of habit , I clicked on my desk computer . I checked my e-mail . It turned out I had one message . A few minutes later , Wiley the prospector returned to Clavius Gulch and headed straight to Marlena \'s . A new sign on the door read : BARROOM CLOSED FOR TOWN MEETING . A security camera visually frisked me and a rabbit hole in the metal plate opened long enough for Wiley to pass through . Marlena had e-mailed others , too . The barroom burgeoned with rovers , some sporting new foil insulation and others , like Wiley and the deceased Pecos , dented and dusty with experience . Sheriff Laszlo was n\'t apparent , and neither was Big Bart , Inc . I had arrived just in time , or maybe she was waiting for me . As           Marlena ascended to the stage and peered over the hats and lenses . SSC chatter died . " All right , " she said . " You know why we \'re here . The UN claims legal jurisdiction over the Moon , but is n\'t protecting citizens " interests . If we want justice , we have to get it ourselves . We \'re going to establish a citizen \'s tribunal . And , as our first order of business , we \'ll bring Big Bart before it for all his crimes against us and our rights . " The crowd betrayed no emotion . I wondered why they were there . Me , I was curious to see how Marlena intended to pull this off . " As I mentioned in my e-mail , " she continued , " Pecos and Wiley here- " she waved a claw at me " -had their camp trespassed and destroyed by Big Bart \'s gang . " She paused . " Pecos also was destroyed . " There was shifting in the crowd , and some murmurs . " We all know           Palladium Consortium . A lot of you are afraid to tangle with BPC , which sometimes seems as powerful as any earthside government . So you \'re lying low , hoping to survive by not being noticed . But if we let them get away with destroying one of us , they \'ll eventually destroy all of us . Their business model is n\'t based on marketing warfare , it \'s based on total warfare-and it \'s not based on cutthroat capitalism , it \'s based on cutthroat criminalism . So like Benjamin Franklin said , we either hang together-or hang separately . " After a sustained silence , someone raised a claw . " What do you propose ? " " Elect a new sheriff , deputize a posse , arrest Big Bart , " Marlena said . " We \'ll bring him back here and give him a fair trial by a jury of his peers-that \'ll be us . It \'ll be just like a court trial on Earth-except with common sense . " Another claw went up . " What about Laszlo ? " " He           " Why should he stop us ? " The crowd got restless , swaying like waves in a choppy sea . From somewhere in the middle someone yelled : " Forget this trial stuff ! String him up ! " Several voices yelled that-but then a huge blue claw , twice as big as a regular rover \'s , shot up from the corner . Into the center rolled Iron Babe , the second biggest rover on the Moon . " I \'m no match for Big Bart , " he said . " I do n\'t think all of us put together are . So how do we overpower him ? " " I \'ve got that covered , " Marlena replied . " But I \'d like to keep it a surprise . " Iron Babe \'s turret revolved . " In other words , you \'re afraid there \'s a spy here . " The word " spy " sent a visible shock through the crowd . Someone headed toward the door and I heard a low voice say , " I just remembered , I have           migration toward the door and it looked like the meeting was over . Marlena had n\'t pulled it off after all . I had n\'t expected her to , but in a way I was disappointed . But before the meeting fizzled into nothingness , a small dust-caked rover limped forward to take the area before the stage . I recognized the primitive box-like structure and rumpled brown hat at once . It was Old Charlie , one of the first prospectors at Clavius , a legend who had been scratching the lunar surface before most of us were a gleam in a CAD/CAM data file . The bull sessions at Marlena \'s Place were rife with tall tales about just how antiquated Old Charlie was : that he had originally been built to prospect for gold-that his CPU was a Z80 chip-that he had helped Armstrong and Aldrin collect rocks-and had waved when Apollo 8 flew over . If anyone had more influence over lunar prospectors than Laszlo , Marlena , or Iron Babe , it was the Ancient One himself , who had dwelt at the dawn of           The One Who Had Started It All , he had at least rubbed shoulders with the guy . The sense of history descended upon us , and the room immediately hushed , and we waited for the reedy , quavering voice that we had all heard so rarely yet knew so well . " About a month ago ... " Old Charlie began . Then he paused , and we waited . Finally , he reboarded his train of thought , and started again : " About a month ago ... I found a shard from the Clavius Impact Object . I spent a full week chiseling out twelve kilos of near-pure palladium ore , enough for a shell load and then some . Then , two blocks from the space gun-right there at the corner of Aldrin and Main in broad earthlight-somebody flips me and takes my bag . The prints were swept up , but I \'ll never forget the shadow behind me ! It was ... Big Bart ! He and his gang left me so beat up , half my solar batteries do n\'t work no           the door had been checked . Marlena \'s eyes turned to me , and her camera mounting dipped once , a most satisfied nod indeed . Lenses zoomed as another robot rolled forward . I recognized Chester from the scraggly beard of plastic strips glued to his undercarriage . " Somebody went into my camp , too , " Chester said . " Stole my microscope . Stole my spectrometer . The security cam caught one of Bart \'s gang dead to rights , but the UN \'s just sitting on it . You all know how much it costs to ship replacement equipment from Earth-and how do I know that wo n\'t be swiped too ? " Rovers retreated from the door and clustered near the stage . And more came forward to speak their piece . Diamond Jim : " Bart \'s boys have been pawing over my survey site for months now . " Fuzzy 2 : " Big Bart smashed Fuzzy 1 into a hundred pieces ! " Little A1 : " My claim \'s registered-but Bart mines it anyhow . " Then the voices ran           ! " " Me too ! " " We ca n\'t stand for this any longer ! " " If we fight , what have we got to lose ? " " So who \'s in the posse ? " Marlena shouted above the tumult . The crowd abruptly fell still and silent . And then-with a massive wave , all at once-manipulators sprouted , a field of mechanical grass whipping in a stiff breeze of political agitation . They all cheered , including me . And for a moment it looked like Marlena was going to have her revolution after all . Then we felt the floor vibrate . We turned to the front . The wall rattled visibly and dents popped in the door plate like a bad case of pimples . The Sonic Simulation Channel \'s pattern-recognition software detected the motion and translated it into the most chilling sound effect I \'d ever heard Clang ... clang ... CLANG ! The whole building shook like it was about to collapse-and then the plate blocking the front door fell inward and slammed into the floor . The immense           , glaring stars eclipsed the sunlight . The silhouette moved toward us . The doorframe caught against the spikes . A claw thrashed and the doorway widened . Big Bart rolled inside and surveyed the scene . " WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT ? " Marlena did n\'t miss a beat . She rolled to the front of the stage and glared back at Bart . " We \'re bringing you to justice , that \'s what ! " The rovers advanced an inch . The excavator did n\'t move , and from my position , I had an excellent opportunity to compare relative sizes . Iron Babe was right : Big Bart was just about as large as all the others put together . It was obvious : he had n\'t been designed for excavation so much as extermination . After that first brave inch , the rovers hesitated . " YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO GET IN MY WAY ? " Big Bart reached behind him , through the hole that had been a doorway . He flung a foil-covered object at the           clung to the fixture , long enough for us to recognize that it was a rover with chassis mangled , wheels and limbs missing , and lenses cracked . Then I saw the blue star dangling beneath the registry label . It was Sheriff Laszlo . Laszlo slipped off the chandelier and fell in the slow motion of lunar gravity to the floor . " NOW WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT ? " Marlena rolled to the end of the stage and took the ramp down to the floor . The rovers cleared a path . She rolled right up to Bart and jabbed a claw at his face . " You do n\'t scare us , Bart ! We- " " MARLENA THE MIDGET ! HA HA HA ! " Marlena \'s manipulator arms drew back for the punch . Bart shadowed her with his claw , and it looked like she was two seconds from becoming metal pizza . But then he had a more ignoble idea . " WHAT THE HELL ! I \'LL USE YOU AS SPARE PARTS ! " The claw plucked Marlena off the           that his work was done , backed out onto the street . " THE REST OF YOU ... I DO N\'T WANT ANY TROUBLE FROM THE REST OF YOU ! " With Marlena struggling helplessly and calling him names that had nothing to do with the Old West , Bart rolled out of sight and the sound of his motor died away . The rovers scattered and the saloon emptied . I was alone with what was left of the United Nations enforcement representative \'s rover . I looked at all the damage-the entry , the chandelier , the debris , the broken rover-and wondered if this was a warm-up act for Big Bart to raze the whole town . He apparently had overcome his fear of the Clavius Gulch Shopowner \'s Association-not to mention the United Nations . Maybe his masters figured that once he brought lunar mining to a halt , their consortium \'s stranglehold on terrestrial palladium production would keep political trouble at bay . " Wiley ! " The voice creaked and was barely audible , but I heard it and directionalized it from the sheriff           eye regarded me . " This is what I get , " Laszlo said , his voice faint and wheezing with static . " After I heard what he did to your partner , I tried to stop Big Bart . I really did . " " I\'m-I \'m sorry , " I said . " It \'s up to you now . You \'ve got to stop him , Wiley . " " What can I do ? He \'s an international corporation and I \'m just one person . If the UN ca n\'t handle him , how can I ? " " Wiley , he destroyed your own partner ! " The sheriff attempted to rise on the stump of his right arm . " If I could overcome my fear , you can too ! " " I\'m-I \'m not afraid . " I lied , and then I thought of a further lie : " Sheriff , look-if there were someone here to help me , if I only knew what to do , I \'d do it ! " The rover \'s manipulator arm           on the floor . The indicator lights died , and so did the law on the Moon . Or so I thought . While I rested alone in the cavernlike saloon , my workstation phone chimed . I routinely redirect my cell phone number into the VR equipment \'s phone system , and had done so that night because I was hoping Lester would call . But it was n\'t Lester . It was Marlena . My searchbeam played across the tombstones on Cemetery Hill : Rusty , Dexter , Ruby , Fuzzy 1 , Calamity Jane , Deadeye ... and Marlena 1 . Opening the gate , I entered the town graveyard of obsolete rovers . I rolled over to the last marker , dragging a shovel behind me . " I \'m there , " I said over the cell phone connection . " Finally ! " Marlena sighed . " Start digging ! " I did . Then I noticed the epitaph on the tombstone : " \' Here lies Marlena One . She was small-but ware n\'t she fun ? " Ware n\'t ? " "           . " It was n\'t just for macabre humor that old robots were buried on the Moon . Having them around meant the " corpses " could be exhumed for spare parts . Keeping them buried the rest of the time protected those potential spare parts from the temperature and radiation extremes of the lunar surface . So there was a practical reason for the underground junkyard . But calling it " Cemetery Hill , " erecting tombstones , carving epitaphs-those touches witnessed to Marlena \'s whimsy at work once again . While I dug , I shook both my heads , human and robotic . " So the Marlena the Robot that I \'ve always known and loved was n\'t the original . " " Nope , " Marlena the Human replied . " She \'s actually Marlena Number Two . Marlena Number One was the robot I drove back in my prospecting days before I opened the saloon . A little before your time . " Mercifully short of the traditional " six feet under , " the shovel bit metal . I scraped away the remaining dust           size of a violin case , and shaped like a coffin . I pried open the lid . Inside lay a tiny rover . It had a single eye and a single claw , and was as gray and lifeless as the Moon . " I can see why you upgraded , " I said . I replaced the old batteries with fresh ones from Marlena \'s inventory . " Power \'s on . see if you can link . " " Should be able to . I \'m transmitting the old access codes ... hey ! " Indicator lights flickered on . The rover in the coffin raised a gnarled , bony claw . Skinny and decrepit , it certainly looked like the limb of a zombie . The camera eye swiveled on Wiley . " Well , get me out of here ! " she demanded . The other parts looked badly worn , but her tongue was as sharp as ever . I pulled her out of the grave , dented antenna and all , and we rolled off Cemetery Hill to the saloon . Entering through           silence over the remains of her enterprise . Then we rolled to the back room , and she entered a closet . I stopped at the threshold and waited . A moment later , she returned , towing a cord . The cord drew a wagon . On the wagon was a cannon . " You \'ve got to be kidding ! " I said . Yes , a miniature cannon , like the ones people mount on yachts to fire blank charges , usually after they \'ve had a few drinks-except this ornament was dull iron instead of polished brass , and Marlena was cold sober . " Bob the Blacksmith forged it for me , " Marlena said to my inquiring stare . " Has it been tested ? " " Of course . It \'s punched through quarter-inch steel plate ! " " How thick is Big Bart \'s armor ? " She patted the barrel . " We \'ll find out . " " And you want me to fire this thing at him ? " " I was n\'t expecting you to be the hero           I appreciate your help . " Our two dumb machines just stared at each other . Finally , I realized I was an unwanted guest , and went out the front way . A few feet outside the saloon , I looked southwest and saw the space gun , pointing toward me like a giant , accusing finger . I turned and looked northeast , and saw the Earth , framed by the building fronts bordering Main Street . Seen from Clavius , the Earth appears to hover in a fixed position , seemingly swollen by its proximity to the horizon , the same optical illusion that makes the newly risen Moon seem huge over the horizons of Earth . But all one has to do is extend one \'s claw and compare it to the globe , and the Earth seems small once more . I thought about Wendell \'s vision of spreading life throughout the universe . If the Earth is one life-bearing planet among millions , then fine , we can afford to stay home and contemplate our navels . But it \'s scientifically legitimate to postulate           transported life across Solar-System distances to Mars , but that would be about it . As far as the stars are concerned , the evidence-or lack thereof-seems to point toward life-lessness . I still think it \'s a stretch to conclude that humanity \'s fate-and the fate of all life in the universe-depends on the economic viability of lunar mining . But what if it was true ? It was a terrible burden that Marlena was bearing on her shoulders , all by herself , especially with that rickety old robot as her only avatar . What did she mean , I was n\'t expecting you to be the hero ? I decided I was going to talk to her about that . Mind you , I was n\'t going to volunteer for anything-I was just going to challenge her temerity about that hero business . Where did she get off , saying what I could and could n\'t be ? I returned to the saloon . In the darkness , a bright spot caught the corner of my eye . I swiveled my camera mounting and saw the shelves           and sold as part of her Old West fantasy . It was a white one that I \'d seen . White : the clich about " the good guys always wear white hats " came to mind . I shook my head . IfI could help it , I would avoid Western visual clichs just as much as verbal ones . I looked over the selection , and laid my claws on a dark brown number . I picked it up . I lowered it on my camera mounting . I rolled over to the mirror . Not exactly Glint Eastwood , but-I tilted it forward a rakish skosh . There . Now that was Glint Eastwood . " You \'re still here ? " She had caught me totally by surprise . I turned around and pulled off the hat . " I left and came back , " I replied . " The hat looks good on you . " She did n\'t see me purse my lips . " You know , " I said , " you have no business telling me I ca n\'t be           to be a hero , but you have no business telling me that I ca n\'t be one . " " Okay .... " " And I thought I could give you some advice . No help-I want to make that absolutely clear-just advice . " " Okay .... " " For one thing , that gun is n\'t going to work . Not by itself . If you \'re going to defeat Big Bart , you \'ll have to do better than a pop gun . " " Okay .... " Well , as you can see , she was just playing out the line ... before she reeled me in . " Are you sure you want to do this ? " Marlena asked about half an hour later . " You know , if you lose Wiley , you could get in trouble with your company-not to mention what kind of trouble you \'ll be in with BPC . " Typical female , I thought . Talks you into something , then tries to make it sound like it was your idea ! " Do n\'t give           said . " I already have enough of those . " Marlena was not in sight , and not in the Sonic Simulation Channel \'s conversational range . We kept in contact over the phone connection . I had left her near the saloon and had taken off down the street , a cowboy hat on my camera mounting and her wagon and cannon in tow , on a search-and-destroy mission for Big Bart . Every cross street and alley I passed , I held my breath , but the giant claw never reached out and grabbed me . Looming shadows did not appear , and every corner proved without surprise . Then-voices ahead . I pulled the wagon into an alley , dropped the tow cord , and rolled ahead on my own . At the corner , I cautiously peered down the street . It was Big Bart and his gang-seven robots in all , most of them my size or bigger . They swaggered down the street , whooping and yelling , carefree as could be . They halted and Bart set a bag down , and           A rover approached with a very large screwdriver , and the others made ribald comments . I got the symbolism and did n\'t like it one bit . " Big Bart ! " I shouted , rolling into the open so that he could see my hat . Bart and his cohorts turned . The rover with the screwdriver lowered it . " What in tarnation ? " I shouted . " It \'s the biggest varmint I \'ve ever seen ! " The robots looked to their leader , but he was just standing still . " Yep , Big Bart , " I said . " Ah reckon you ai n\'t nothin " but a slimy ol " rattlesnake ! " He swung toward me and lunged a foot-but halted . He waved a claw and chuckled . " GET LOST , PIPSQUEAK ! " The rover holding the screwdriver raised it again , and the rest gathered around Marlena \'s prone body again , and the laughter resumed . So I went to Plan B. Out of my carrying compartment , I drew Lester \'s gun .           that this was it-I was about to incur the wrath of one of the biggest corporations on Planet Earth , and there would be no turning back . But then , there had been no turning back from the moment their spy had snuck into our lab tent . What happened now was simply inevitable fallout . Their backsides were studiously turned toward me , but my spirit of fair play was at an all-time low . I took aim at the character with the screwdriver , pulled the trigger and made a little crater in the street next to his left rear wheel . The others still laughed and joked about Marlena-but he noticed . His camera mounting turned . I compensated my aim a tweak-and then I made a little crater in him . Sparks spat from the puncture in the rover \'s side . He jerked to a halt , his lights extinguished , his manipulator arms went limp , and the screwdriver tumbled out of his claws . The laughter and jokes died . The gang turned around as a unit . Wasting no time ,           gang was gone . The survivors scurried behind their boss-who glared straight at me. 1 emptied the pistol , but it was useless against him . I tossed it away and scrammed back towards the alley . The dark crab \'s " third eye " opened , and out came the barrel . I passed around the corner before it fired . The shell blew through the building walls , inches from where I \'d been . I passed Marlena \'s wagon twenty feet from the alley mouth . I got behind the cannon and looked back . In the gap between shattered walls , Bart \'s headlamps gleamed upon the street dust . The ground trembled beneath my wheels . I raised one claw to the cannon \'s firing switch , and the hardest part was waiting . Bart turned the corner . I pressed the switch . The cannon flashed and recoiled . A tracer ball streaked toward where Bart \'s heart would be , if he had one . It was a direct hit . The ball bounced off , leaving only a small dent . Bart           and he and his entourage charged . I abandoned the cannon just as a retaliatory shell blasted it to bits . The remains of the cannon and wagon must have slowed Bart down while he crunched them under his tank tracks , but I did n\'t look back . I swerved around the next corner , raced down the street , and swung into another alley . " Marlena ! " I called . Our terrestrial phone link was clear as a bell , but still I shouted breathlessly . " They \'re chasing me ! Get ready ! " " I \'m ready ! " she shouted back . Headlamps flashed my long shadow in front of me . I broke out of the alley and rolled down Gold Street . I zigged and zagged , and Bart \'s shells missed , his aim crippled by the three-second Einsteinian delay in Newton \'s Third Law . An intersection came up . I veered right . " I \'m on Armstrong Avenue ! " " Is he behind you ? " He was n\'t . I might have lost him           a flash , Bart and his gang swung past the corner , and bore down . I spun my wheels and hurled toward the next intersection . " Coming up on Main ! " A shell splattered Wiley \'s hide with dust . " Get ready ! " Heading southeast , I crossed Main and looked on my left at the saloon . Farther down , Marlena waved a bandanna . The distraction was almost fatal . A shell hit near my wheels . A rotor status bar flashed red and an rpm reading dropped to zero . I steered right to compensate . I sprinted past Main , hid behind an alley corner , and peered out . Bart and his gang were crossing the intersection . This is it , I thought . But nothing happened . He passed the intersection unharmed , and I retracted into the alley just in time to dodge another shell . " Marlena ! You were supposed to shoot ! " " I would have missed ! " she cried . " It \'s the time delay ! " " What do           have to lead the target ! " " Well , how the hell am I supposed to do that , Brian ? " she snapped . " By the time I see him clear the buildings on the right , he \'s already through the intersection and behind the buildings on the left . How do I lead a target I ca n\'t even see until it \'s too late ? " The best laid plans of mice and microrovers . The plan made sense in the saloon half an hour ago . With the enemy engaged , it unraveled with the speed of light . " Brian , " she said . " The only way we can do this is if you bring him back to Main-and keep him there ! " " I can bring him back to Main-but how am I supposed to keep him there ? " She did n\'t answer , but I did n\'t have to ask . I knew what she was thinking . I \'d been the lure this far , and now I \'d have to hop inside the fish           murmured . " Nice knowing you-hope they do n\'t take you out of my severance pay ! " I ducked up Tsiolkovsky Street , heading northeast . Bart \'s lights outlined my shadow . My spine chilled . He was less than thirty yards behind , and closing . My shadow shortened . I felt his breath . I weaved between his shells . A rover pulled alongside Wiley and bumped him . A blur streaked overhead and disintegrated a wall . I reached Aldrin Avenue . I turned right . " On Aldrin ! " I shouted . " Heading toward Main ! " It was not a good time for my low-charge indicator to blink . I reached the intersection of Aldrin and Main . I stopped . The assailant rover flew past . I turned northeast , toward Earth , and rolled a few yards , and stopped again . I waited . Big Bart stampeded into the intersection . He saw me and skidded to a stop . The leviathan turned toward me . " Get him to move a little to the west ! "           over my rover . I backed up , rolled around the newly dug crater , and moved west . Bart fired again , and missed . He gave up shooting then , raised his claws and closed in . I backed up-but then bumped into something . Bart \'s accomplices formed a semicircle , hemming me in . One rover clamped a claw on my antenna , and another grabbed my towing ring , and I could n\'t break free . Big Bart loomed over Wiley \'s struggling body , and raised his claw , poised to piledrive . Marlena , he \'s in position ! I thought Go ahead and do it ! " POOR OLD WILEY , " Big Bart boomed . " YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE I RESPECTED , BECAUSE YOU DID N\'T GO ALONG WITH ALL THAT COWBOY CRAP . BUT NOW SHE \'S GOT YOU WEARlNG A HAT , TOO . " " Yep , " I said . My brain had frozen and I did n\'t know what else to say . Marlena-do it ! " THAT WAS CLEVER , THE WAY YOU           CANNON . BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ? YOU NEEDED A BIGGER GUN . " " Yep , " I said . Marlena ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! " TROUBLE IS , THERE IS N\'T A GUN BIG ENOUGH TO SCARE ME ANYWHERE ON- " Big Bart hesitated , and looked at the Earth-and I think he figured it out . A second and a half too late . " Yep , " I said . Marlena-SHOOT , damn it ! And she did . The ten-kilo shell that Marlena fired from the space gun exited the muzzle at two and a half kilometers per second and streaked a meter above Main Street to impact Big Bart milliseconds later with enough kinetic energy to sink a battleship . It ripped through his backside armor and gutted his innards and punched a hole as big as his face-that obliterated his face-and spewed his components over Wiley \'s head and a tenth of a mile down Main , across Collins and Conrad Avenues and halfway to the Calibration Target Monolith . Bart \'s claws snapped off , his           and debris and smoke gushered everywhere . The noise-oh , the SSC-generated noise ! It was like a tornado and volcanic eruption at the same time , and somewhere in there I thought I heard an all-too-human scream . Instinctively , after the fact , I closed my eyes and ducked . And then there was ringing silence . I opened my eyes and raised my head . Gasses dissipated and sparks died , and what remained of Big Bart was a charred , lifeless hulk . The three survivors of Big Bart \'s gang sized me up . But before they could act , a door on a nearby building opened , and a pair of lenses peeped out . Then another door , and other eyes . A rover rolled out onto the street , and it was joined by a second and third . Soon there was a crowd . They all seemed to be carrying cords and blunt instruments . When I turned around , Big Bart \'s cohorts were in rapid evaporation . A small , dusty rover hobbled from the space gun control station           and took in the piles of incandescently glowing scrap metal littering the street . " Wow , " she said . " You took your time , " I said . " I wanted my aim to be perfect . " I glanced at the shattered carcass that used to contain Big Bart , and said the only thing that came to mind : " Yep . " The lights abruptly faded from Marlena 1 ; the excitement had proven too much for the old girl , and she passed away , right then and there . But a minute later , Doc strolled around the corner , escorting a polished silver robot adorned with sparkling jewels and a billowing lace headdress that flopped vigorously with every swaying movement . Marlena 2-the Marlena I had always known-tackled Wiley and squeezed him with her claws and half-lifted him off the ground and almost gave him a dance-hall twirl . " I \'ve got something for you ! " she declared . She rolled back a foot and opened a compartment on her side . Out came a shiny piece of metal           star . It must have had a powerful magnet attached to the back , because when she placed it on Wiley \'s front , it stuck tenaciously . " Brian , I want you to know , " Marlena said , " you \'re my candidate for sheriff of Clavius Gulch . If your company wo n\'t let you keep Wiley , we \'ll get you another rover so you can stay here . You \'re going to be voted sheriff , Brian-even if I have to bribe every rover in town with free lubes for a year ! " " I-I have to think , " I said , tilting my Clint-Eastwood hat back and regarding the crowd of curious telerobots gathered around us . But part of me was already thinking I \'d take the job . The events of the past day had sure been a lot more exciting than drilling for regolith samples . And Lester would n\'t mind serving as deputy . And who knew ? Maybe the job of sheriff of Clavius Gulch came with a salary that could cover the rent and phone           was n\'t ready to commit just then . I disconnected myself from her embrace and rolled away . My thoughts were a blur . I was still rattled by the chase and showdown , and the explosive end of Big Bart still rang in my ears . Just then , I did n\'t know where I was going , I just wanted to go away and think in peace . But at the top of Cemetery Hill , I stopped and looked back at the town , aglow in the dying rays of the long lunar day . Marlena and the other rovers were still in the middle of Main Street , devotedly watching me . I had the strangest feeling . I turned the other way again , and blinked in the afternoon Sun , which was almost touching the lunar horizon directly ahead . And then I realized what was bugging me about the scene . " Oh , Lord , " I sighed . I closed my eyes and shook my head-and groaned . It was n\'t because I was pondering humanity \'s future . It was           I groaned because , unintentionally , I was acting out the biggest clich of the Old West . I groaned because , by happenstance , I was heading west . Which meant that , from the view of the townspeople of Clavius Gulch . . . Sheriff Wiley was riding off into the sunset . \n Mason Salisbury and his son , Moreau , were hunting by Little Sandy Creek several miles from where the stream ran through town and powered the Salisbury mill . Father and son carried old fowling pieces and had n\'t brought the dogs ; they were n\'t hunting so much as talking . Moreau was home from seminary in Cazenovia . He had n\'t wanted to be a miller , and who could argue with a desire to serve God ? A father , perhaps , but Mason had n\'t . Moreau left Sandy Creek convinced " there was more in heaven and earth than a grist mill . " Mason had wondered how much " more " resided in seminary .', '" I \'m not a good speaker , " said Moreau .', "Moreau 's life , if he stayed in Sandy Creek , would be work , family , community . He was the only son of a miller , a Baptist in a congregation where not less than forty people were either Salisburys or married to a Salisbury , the richest man in town was married to a Salisbury , and Uncle Lorenzo Salisbury had a large farm down the Salt Road . Moreau feared his life might run as predictably and slowly as the creek moving over the broken layers of limestone and its hundreds of little falls , as Little Sandy wound through town , collected in the mill pond , and flowed to Lake Ontario . So he went to Cazenovia looking for God .", 'Father and son and everybody in town and all the towns in Jefferson and Oswego Counties talked of war . Since the Dred Scott decision when the Supreme Court upheld the Fugitive Slave Act , reaffirming the legality of returning human beings to bondage , Mason felt war was inevitable .', '" North and South compromised to avoid war , " said Moreau .', "Moreau knew his father meant what he said . Mason supported the UGRR , the underground railroad for getting runaway slaves to Canada . From here it was eighty miles north and across the St. Lawrence , or a dangerous fifty across open lake . The main route was           sometimes tired and frightened men and women came through Sandy Creek , were hidden in the mill among sacks of meal until Mason escorted the fugitives to a lumber boat . Moreau had taken food and clothing into the mill for half-starved men , and once a shivering woman , but he 'd never accompanied a runaway to Canada .", '" Tell about New York and Washington , " Moreau said . The story was a ritual between father and son .', 'It started as a lark-the greatest lark in local history . A neighbor , Colonel Thomas Meacham , was a showman . One might think the difficulties of wrestling a town out of the forests of the North Country , along with the ferocious winters , would freeze a man           froze in winter , but Meacham \'s mind never rested . He built the Agricultural Hall on what became the fairgrounds . He trained the local militia . In 1835 the colonel decided to make a " universal " name for himself and the town . Meacham proposed to make the world \'s largest cheese and present it to President Andrew Jackson . The Democrats were delighted , the Whigs thought presenting one cheese to another most appropriate , and cynics , which the North Country produced like oaks , thought the idea would mark Sandy Creek as home to the world \'s biggest cheese and biggest fool .', 'In July Colonel Meacham soaked hickory boards in the creek , bent           a circle to make a gigantic cheese hoop . Meacham made the cheese in the Agricultural Hall , so all could watch . He first removed the permanent exhibits : the only McCormick Reaper north of Albany , a stuffed three-legged chicken , and the pice de rsistance , a two-headed calf pickled in brine . The colonel understood imagination is fired by the rational and the outrageous-scientific marvels and freaks of nature . The cheese was the marvel ; taking it to Andrew Jackson , outrageous .', 'After completing the hoop , Meacham slaughtered four heifers , removed their fourth stomachs-the gastronomically preferred stomach-and soaked the guts in           for curdling milk . A giant cheese press took two months to build and looked like a gibbet , except a millstone was lowered from a six-foot arm , not a criminal .', "The Salisburys were for the colonel           to Washington . He was twenty-six and wanted to meet new people , especially important ones , see new places , especially New York City , and meet women , possibly rich . Mason had secretly dreamed of going to New York City to seek his fortune . Lorenzo , taller , quiet , more interested in how things worked than people or cities , thought making the largest cheese only a matter of degree . He was more interested in how it would be transported . Lorenzo had married in March and did n't wish to leave his bride , even to meet Andrew Jackson .", 'The next day , " the Ides of November , " Mason quipped , forty-eight gray stallions pulled a sledge carrying the great cheese and eight smaller ones , only seven hundred fifty pounds each , which were to be given to dignitaries along the way . A cannon fired a salute , and a procession a mile long of buggies and swells on their best mounts followed the cheeses down the Salt Road to Pulaski , where flatboats took them to the lake port of Selkirk .', 'A schooner had been engaged to take the cheeses and men to Oswego . A vicious storm blew up after dark , ripping down the forward jib and almost washing Meacham \'s marvels off the sleetslicked deck . Neither brother had ever been caught on the lake at night in a storm , let alone a winter storm . Mason prayed on his knees and held on to his bunk . Lorenzo shook his head and went on deck to help secure the cheeses . Mason retched . The next day they laughed , and Lorenzo said , " The lake \'s a treacherous lady . " Mason swore he \'d never sail on it at night again . Silently , he swore to never be that afraid again .', 'Lorenzo was prescient to ask about pirates           worked it rough . Buffalo , New York , had the highest murder rate in the country . " Canawlers " finishing the trip from Albany drank , whored , fought , and often found the end of life \'s journey with a crushed skull at the bottom of their beloved " canawl . " Near Troy , two hundred fifty miles west , was the " Bloody Cut , " a hotbed for gangs looking for fights and loot between jobs .', '" I wish I \'d been there , " Moreau said . It was the           overtly . " I wish I \'d been with you . "', "Mason had been twenty-six . Lorenzo twenty-five . They 'd been brought up on tales of 1812 , when Sackets Harbor was the most important ship building port on the Great Lakes and local men ambushed the British at Big Sandy . Mason 's generation had n't gotten a war . He often lamented the fact . War had come in Texas where a hundred eighty men in an old mission would find immorality in death , but in 1835 a Sandy Creek man needed imagination to be noticed .", '" That \'s the way I felt . "', '" Things he would n\'t tell anyone ? " said his father .', '" I felt it . "', '" Stand clear ! " ordered Meacham . Shadows ominously rose and fell over gangway , deck , and men .', '" Not with the likes of you ! "', "Lorenzo was directly behind Colonel Meacham , so the irregular light and leaping shadows did n't reveal the contours of the weapon under the brown coat , or perhaps Malone was carried away with audacity and liquor .", '" Whigs ! Whigs ! " yelled the torch-bearers .', 'Malone swaggered up the gangway . " I like that hat ! " Malone reached for Meacham \'s topper , and Lorenzo Salisbury did to Patch Malone what Hernn Corts did to Montezuma-took him hostage , sticking both barrels into Patch \'s stomach and           Lorenzo yanked the one-eyed man onto the deck and then pulled back each brass hammer . Each clicked menacingly .', 'Malone looked at the gun and turned his head . " Back , men . "', "Even as a child , Moreau thought the moral of that episode was n't the gun , quick-thinking , or courage , but some men are believed when they say they 'll shoot you ; others are n't . Moreau did n't think he was one of those believed . Or his father . Uncle Lorenzo was another matter .", 'The Brian Boru entered the Hudson River , and Mason had never seen anything as majestic as the cliffs , towering trees , wide river , and constant traffic . All water , he told Lorenzo , leads to New York . One could go from Lake Superior to London or Africa or China . Water was the road to the world , and they were on it .', "Both men were awed by the broad river as it passed under the promontories of West Point and sluiced through the Storm King Gap . Even in cold , gray December , they felt the genteel richness of the Hudson Valley . This was life backed by money and families who 'd been here two hundred years . Mason wanted to live hereeither in this patrician valley where winter did n't bury cabins , next to water that would n't kill you , or in the city rising at the mouth of the mighty Hudson . Any fool could see this was the gateway to the world . Lorenzo thought Mason saw what Mason wanted to see . This was nothing new , and Lorenzo kept his opinion to himself .", 'Mason noted they arrived on the Ides of December , a full month out of the North Country . " Another fateful day , " he told his brother .', 'They walked Pearl Street , taking in the maze of new wooden buildings that seemed to have sprung up on every available patch of land . Lorenzo commented on that particularly New York street mix of men with nothing to do and men in a devil of a hurry . Mason admitted the place was huge and filthy . They both thought the natives either looked too closely or paid you no attention . Lorenzo , gun under his long coat , wondered how so many people could live so close together without killing each other . He was told they frequently did . The brothers stopped for a nickel glass of beer and accompanying free lunch-bad cheese on bad breadin a place with sawdust on the floor and grimy pictures of racehorses and prizefighters , including Tom Molineaux , ex-Virginian slave turned British pugilist , on the walls . Mason confided to Lorenzo he was thinking of seeking his fortune in New York , and Lorenzo replied , " I           his bride to keep Mason from leaving the North Country , and was deeply touched . He took his brother \'s arm when they walked out .', "Whatever might have happened with con men , corn girls , unaccompanied women , or the host of canny Manhattan folk who emerged after dark-the potential comedy or disaster of Yankee jakes negotiating the Bowery-was cut short by the night of the sixteenth . Mason 's facetious foreboding about the Ides of November and December came wildly true . Fire broke out around nine p.m . Sheets of flame rose over the tall dry goods and hardware stores on Merchant Street and raced through the district incinerating hovels , factories , doggeries , even the Stock Exchange . In fifteen minutes , fifty buildings were on fire . Then all structures , brick , stone , wood-warehouse , office , or church-were burning           . A nor'wester cut the city with sleet , ice , driving snow . Wells and cisterns froze . Fireman , exhausted from fighting a large fire at Burling 's Slip the previous day , and decimated by cholera the previous summer , were slow to arrive . When they did , most hydrants were frozen ; when hoses sprayed , water froze into hail . The wind blew so hard the East River was flattened and suction hoses could n't reach the water . It was disaster worthy of any country parson 's Gomorrahic vision of New York .", '" Were you scared ? " Moreau asked .', "Fire raged across Lower Manhattan . The Salisburys raced down Pearl Street to Hawkins ' American Museum .", "The wind was at their backs pushing the fire , filling the street with cinders and smoke . The brothers reached the building and found the colonel . Meacham put horse blankets over the cheese , and the three men had to carry it to a sleigh . Back home it took eleven men and a cheering crowd ,           the thick grove of willows and oaks by the creek . Something moved , but Moreau preferred his father 's tale to tramping out a pheasant or rousting a grouse . He looked at the old man-white beard , hard muscles , alert eyes-and wondered what the young man had been like . Who was that man who left Sandy Creek to do things he would n't tell anyone ? There was a restlessness about Mason now , so uncharacteristic of the North Country , a willingness to engage anyone in talk on any subject , though the subject invariably became abolition . Moreau knew his father had been tested . Tested in the big city . What a gift , he thought , provided you survived . That was the great thing about the cheese story . The teller had been there and survived .", 'The men got the cheese to the sleigh . Under ordinary circumstances this would have been miraculous           burn for sixteen hours and destroy 693 buildings , nothing was ordinary . The colonel and the two Salisburys dragged the cheese off its pedestal-it was not destined for a long New York run-and hauled it out as the museum roof caught fire . The brothers hung on to cheese and sleigh as Meacham whipped the horses , and they flew down Pearl Street . Sparks went over their heads , burned the horses , danced in red air . " The devil do n\'t drive faster ! " Lorenzo yelled . Mason looked back and saw the American Museum go up as they dashed for the river . Smoke choked the streets ; cinders burned pedestrians . Horses reared . They saw a fire wagon turn over at the corner of Water Street .', '" We ai n\'t sinned yet ! " shouted Lorenzo .', "Moreau liked thinking of his father and uncle hurling through New York City 's worst fire , up to their elbows in cheese , rushing through flame , sparks , and falling debris . Whoever heard of anything so wonderful ? The lessons were clear : heroism is expected ; survival is purchased with courage .", 'Within sight of the Brian Boru straining at its mooring but untouched by spark or flame , they heard a ferocious crack . The heat was so intense , Mason thought the air had exploded . " Look out ! " Lorenzo shouted . A church steeple teetered : cinders and flame shot hundreds of feet in the air .', "The colonel whipped the team . The story could have ended in the ruins of Pearl Street in sight of the canal           on town hubris and city peril , but the horses found an extra burst . The steeple came down in a plume of sparks , glowing wood , and rushing flame . It grazed the sleigh 's tailgate .", '" What the hell good are churches , anyway ? " Lorenzo said .', 'No crowds greeted the cheese in Washington . People at the station were more interested in the disaster in New York . Christmas in the capital was a muddy , lonely affair . Everyone , it seemed , had somewhere else to be . The city was a disappointment . The roads were unpaved and the buildings so far apart fire was           idea for a city . " A hope and a plan . December must not be the best month . " Lorenzo wondered how populated the city might become . Colonel Meacham was informed President Jackson , though appreciative of the cheese , was too sick to meet the North Country men .', 'Mason had stopped looking for signs . He was trying to shake a cough and congestion brought on by the cold in New York and damp of Washington . He was ready to go home           dirty and crowded even when not on fire , and visit a young woman who had been most sorry to see him go .', '" I \'m not impressed , " Mason said .', '" It ai n\'t even Albany , " said Mason .', '" Slaves , " said Lorenzo .', "They walked towards the White House and considered stopping to inquire about the President 's health . The day was gray and cold , though walking in the damp air felt less chilly than their drafty boarding           and Lorenzo had his short-stocked shotgun .", 'The brothers stood in the door . Lorenzo put his hand under his coat .', "The Salisburys did n't answer .", '" A quarter . "', 'The Salisburys looked at each other .', "Mason was humiliated , fascinated , and furious . He could n't watch ; he could n't not watch . He felt the raw satisfaction of the stable hands . They guffawed and swigged . He felt the hot arrogance of cruelty in John . The vicious pride . Mason again stood before men . He took off his coat , walked over straw , by the hat , lantern , John , the whip . He put his coat over the man 's bloody shoulders . The coat covered him to the ankles .", '" He \'s cold , " said Mason .', '" Yankees do n\'t know niggers , " said           "', '" Thank him , " said John , touching the Negro \'s ear with the whip .', 'Lorenzo was behind Mason . Coat unbuttoned .', '" Do you call yourself a Christian ? " said Mason , looking John in the eye .', 'A stable hand reached for a pitchfork . Another picked up a rake .', 'No one moved .', '" No , " said Lorenzo .', '" I \'ll kill him , " said Mason . A red mark ran from Mason \'s cheek to his hairline .', 'Mason stepped on the hat .

Unlike his father , he has the welfare of his nation at heart , not personal gain           for the future of Gaul is at stake .', 'A gloomy forest . The undergrowth of shrubs is thick because the branches have been laced together , creating an impenetrable living wall . Somberly robed Druids pass through a concealed entrance to their sacred meeting place , an open space encircled by huge oaks . The limbs of the trees , covered with mistletoe ( which is sacred to the Druids ) , form a dome that lets in only a few beams of sun . Crudely garbed , rotting images of ancient gods are propped up against the trunks of the trees . The only sound to be heard is the doleful chanting of priests mourning their dead chief .

Two months ago Redfield Baptist hosted a visiting evangelist by the name           ten years younger than Jeffrey , with shoulders the width of double doors and an upper body bursting with stiff protuberant muscles . Rudy Simpson , Jeffrey \'s associate pastor , had seen Jones speak at an out-of-state revival and began lobbying at church board meetings for the implementation of a visiting-minister fund from a percentage of the weekly tithes . In a month \'s time , Rudy said , the fund would accrue to a stipend generous enough to attract a visit from the man who was " easily the most charismatic preacher in the country .

The desire is a kind of trance , and he surrenders to it often-lets the desire loose until it \'s like a thing exterior to them both . It hangs just above their bodies , mastering them . Under its command they \'ve done things they never thought they \'d do . Their bodies have become like mouths and they \'ve eaten at one another with great hunger . They \'ve collided and whirled and made the bed frame convulse . For the last few years it \'s been happening often-almost regularly-and every time , once it has passed , they lie blinking and unsure of how to look at one another , catching their breath as if they \'ve just come through great danger . Then in the darkness Jeffrey will feel the unbearable red heat in his cheeks , the low ache in his chest that wo n\'t           He \'ll think of Psalms 36 : They plot mischief while on their beds ; they are set on a way that is not good ; they do not reject evil .

The Good Handshake', 'R.           like someone under a steadily lowering magnifying glass , kept getting bigger until he stood monolithically in front of Jeffrey and the Dodge Dart , the vehicle shrunken to the stature of a Matchbox car . A dark cap of tiny curls , like the soft half of Velcro , fit his large skull snugly . In one hand he held a monstrous plaid suitcase , a thing nearly half the size of himself , gripped nonchalantly as though it were just a purse . His free hand rose like something defying gravity , a concrete sledge suddenly gone weightless , and Jeffrey met it with his best shake-saw his pale hand enveloped and crushed in the squeeze of the cucumber-thick fingers .', '" A pleasure .

On the honor roll for her fourth consecutive year , she 's already applied to Northwest Baptist College in Oregon , and she dresses with a punctilious tendency toward modesty and prettiness .

He entered Jeff Jr . ' s room , sat beside him on the bed , spoke to him clearly and forcefully-but the boy just looked sullen and           the changes were happening so fast and with such covert determination that Jeffrey was helpless to waylay them . After weeks of furious prayer , he resorted to calm expressions of his and the Lord 's paternal love . Employing his Redfield Baptist stationery , he wrote Jeff Jr . a careful note and left it in an envelope on the boy 's pillow .", "But J. J. 's silence only deepened . The boy retreated into his room as into a cave and soon refused to attend church . By the end of his senior year he was driving the eighty-five miles to San Francisco nearly every weekend , packed with his darkly clad , anemic-looking friends in the sputtering , unwashed station wagon that belonged to one of them ( which one of them , Jeffrey could never figure out ) .", 'J. J. darkened his blond eyelashes with black mascara , traced strips of charcoal eyeliner above and beneath both blue eyes , eyes just like his mother \'s . " Why does he do that to himself ?

He looks just like a girl , does n\'t he ? "', '" Jeff ! " he roared from the head of the table-exerting a rage that made his wife and girl flinch and even startled himself .

Always when it happens they struggle for quietness , and on those nights it was particularly difficult-the special danger raised them to a new euphoria in which they could barely stifle their blazing voices . In the morning , after the night 's illicit pleasure and its coda of shame , Jeffrey sat across from Jones at the breakfast table , watching the huge paws buttering toast with a surprising gingerness , and wondered if the evangelist had heard anything . A crackle in the guest room ceiling ? Flakes of asbestos shuddering loose and drifting down through the darkness , Jones 's bare feet stepping on them in the morning ? But the evangelist was an edifice of composure , as put together as a Grecian monument and nearly as hard to read . He talked in a meek , almost breathy voice , though he filled the Ghildses ' rooms with a presence of beast-like proportions , lumbering about with steps he could n't keep from thundering through the floor .", "There was n't a rustle in the sanctuary , though hosts of enthused Amenls came from every corner of the congregation to echo under the high A-framed ceiling . In one muscular hand Jones hefted a black leather Bible . His other hand trembled on his outstretched arm , snapping into a colossal fist that pounded the air , or else jabbing a blunt forefinger heavenward . He closed his eyes , threw his head back , his thick neck flexed , and sweat beaded his temples and throat . The altar seemed to quake . Shouted Hallelujahis sprang from the pews with a profusion that bristled every tiny hair on the back of Jeffrey 's neck . He too shouted the word and punched the air in front of him with a spirited uppercut .", '" Stand up ! " he cried to the congregation , waving both his hands upward as though throwing something over his shoulders . " Stand up and sing with me to the Lord ! "', 'On the Friday evening following Jones \'s           welcome dinner in the church gymnasium , a barbecue buffet sponsored by the Redfield Baptist board . Back at home afterwards , Angela offered to brew some tea . Jones said : " No , thank you . I sure wish you folks had told me about your boy . "', '" He told me about Jeffrey Jr. , " Jones said , " and I \'m sorry to say I did n\'t know how to respond . "', 'Jones spoke very softly and Jeffrey kept from           shame in this house .

Jones sat at the kitchen table for lunch that first Sunday after church . They ate hoagies , Jeffrey \'s favorite-the twelve-inch things filling their plates , garnished with glinting potato chips and dill pickles . Angela and Samantha shared one between them as always . Jeffrey watched , gnawing , as Jones plucked up his sandwich , the big thing dainty-looking in the evangelist \'s massive grip , and all at once he \'d plummeted to his day \'s lowest dismay . He told himself he would go somewhere alone once lunch was over , resolved to eat quickly and did , saying very           . Samantha even spoke up , said : " It was very powerful , " gazing at the evangelist with sheepish eyes .', 'There was a shriek and Angela jumped up shouting . " Samson , no !

In the opposite lane a semi thundered past .

He had read for eight long hours and heard the all-powerful voice of Jesus ringing in his ears , driving him to his knees , impelling him to open his heart and receive the Lord who made him and died           , but it \'s not the kind of stuff to make people shout and cry : raised in Angel \'s Gamp , California , the second son of a second-generation minister ; reared in his father \'s church ( Angel \'s Gamp Baptist ) and always faithful to its teachings-his only period of defiance a short-lived month or two in his fifteenth year when he insisted on attending Pioneer Baptist across town , where he met Angela ; enrolled in Southern California Seminary at eighteen ; married Angela at twentyone ( " I \'ll have a church , " he said to her back then . " You \'ll be my First Lady . " ) ; pastured his first church ( God \'s Church in Stockton ) until his thirty-eighth year ; came to Redfield Baptist five years ago . No sexual misadventure , no drug experimentation , no criminal transgressions . The story \'s one compelling moment : that instance at age sixteen , sitting in a wooden pew in Angel \'s Gamp Baptist listening to his father preach and being suddenly and inexplicably filled with the Holy           ankles , quickly purling upward through his legs , his stomach , his heart , stiffening the hairs on his head . Knowing then , without a doubt , that he was meant to be a preacher . That he was called . A fine story , but one that clearly paled against the dramatic lighting of Jones \'s .', '" Good Lord ! " Jeffrey panted . " Thank you , Jesus . Thank you .

Words piled           the wooden podium and gagged softly into the microphone , tried to fashion words , could n\'t . He thought of Christ \'s suffering-the unthinkable extent of it . He glanced helplessly at Angela , seated in her blue Sunday dress and staring up at him from the first pew , a tissue wrung ragged in her fingers .', '" It \'s all right , Jeffie , " she whispered , leaning away from the microphone-and he was impressed by that : how collected she was even in a moment like this , thinking to lean away from the microphone . He felt her hand at his back , pressing there through his tailored jacket . " It \'s all right , dear . We \'ve           You can do it , Jeffrey . They \'ll forgive us .

Ah Samantha ! -little Christian daughter . After he and Angela told her , she had wept through half the night for her brother 's soul .", "And now he saw it : Of course ! -J . J. would never have gone astray if Jeffrey himself were n't so depraved , trapped in his cycle of lechery with Angela . How could he ever have hoped for his son 's salvation ? -the boy raised in the           so much wire fencing . Jeffrey himself was to account for the boy 's sin , and God would hold Jeffrey 's congregation away from him so long as he lived in secret sin with Angela . Barely six days after he 'd confessed J. J 's evils , the Redfield Baptist board had begun talk of hiring an outside evangelist .", "Jeffrey pulled south off Highway 12 . He 'd been gone three quarters of an hour already and would have to bring something back . A narrow frontage road slithered ahead of him , blue gravel lusterless in the smoky light . Fourteen months before , the church board had come to a consensus on the need for better advertising . Across town , San Joaquin Free Evangelist had recently strung a big ten-foot banner between two PVC pipes . The banner faced Redfield Boulevard and said clearly in primary-colored letters :", 'Services Sundays 9 AM 10 A.M. 11 AM Wednesdays 7 PM .', "Jeffrey had driven out here to Gecelia 's Signs to place the order , and within three days the banner was up in front of his church . Now , pulling into the gravel lot in front of the dusty shop , he had a new idea-one inspired by the soul-searching tumult of his drive along Highway 12 , one sure to please the Redfield Baptist board .", '" Hi , Gecelia . Got another order for you . "', '" Go ahead and fill her out like last time . " Gecelia propped her tumid elbows near the paper \'s edge as Jeffrey wrote . " Heard about your boy , " she said .', '" Ron Meyer , fellow from your church works at Hubbard \'s Gun Shop mentioned it . Saw Ron a couple months ago at the Chamber of Commerce meeting .

Even in the midst of R. V. Jones 's unstoppable evangelical coup , even in the midst of Jeff Jr . ' s waywardness and his own fateful lechery-still it was coming to wipe everything clean . The deserving would be gathered , the undeserving scattered ,           grown up expecting the Rapture . He remembered Mrs. Gardener-the famous member of his father 's church in Angel 's Gamp . She would stand from her pew during Sunday evening testimony , shuddering on eighty-something legs , waving bony fingers through the air and bubbling over in godly trance . She was known to have the scalding light of the Holy Spirit in her , and when she spoke nobody could doubt it . As a young man , Jeffrey looked to her with a novitiate 's kind of awe .", "Always , after a few moments of silence , as the possibility swelled and terror grew to restlessness , he would pick up the phone and dial Mrs. Gardener 's number . If Mrs. Gardener answered , then he could be sure all was well , that Mother and Father had stepped out a moment and would return . Then she did answer-her voice creaking through the line-and he returned the phone to its cradle without a word . Or she did n't answer and he listened in mute horror to the repeating purr on the other end . Delayed rhythms like the tenuous pulse of something dying . Listened till he was sure she would n't answer , then stood stricken in the empty house , catastrophe welling inside him till it burned in his cheeks-but at last Mother would come in from the neighbors ' house . Or Father would come in from the far tool shed , and Jeffrey would tremble with relief as potent as a barbiturate , would           he would never sin again and so never fear again .

I do n\'t get it . And whenever I try to pop diagnostics in there , I get personae coming out talking like William Blake or Rumi or somebody . All this visionary crap .

" I was trying out an idea about using figuration , you know , to give Virtizens a common background , baseline cultural literacy , trying to code not just the facts but , you know , modes of thinking . " Realizing that he \'s about to run beyond the boundaries of Mike \'s understanding , he reels himself back in . " But when I ran the sims , once that started to happen , this kind of death spiral occurs . The figuration gets more and more abstruse , more cognitive distance between vehicle and tenor , you know ? Then nobody knows what anyone else is talking about .

No koinos kosmos . "', '" I do n\'t either , " Gautam says . " Picked that up in a book somewhere , ou know ? And anyway , asshole , it \'s Greek . But it means that when each of the personae starts to customize itself , it branches off so much and with such big leaps that pretty soon they \'re all so far away from each other that they ca n\'t communicate anymore .

Shannon ca n\'t even look at Aunt Sara , who           panting , " Let me check , " with the pensive and disturbingly canine expression of a distracted idiot . Shannon goes looking for a newsstand , but they \'re all gone but one that erupts in a flood of letters that run away down the street at her approach . Left behind , by itself on the counter , is a broadsheet newspaper , alone on a low table and irregularly haloed by smeared and bloody handprints . She picks it up and from the texture guesses that today \'s edition of Meatspace News was printed from pretty good tenderloin .', 'And her foot is killing her , and something is wrong with her eyes , chimerical sparkles in her peripheral vision .

Epilepsy in Shambhala ? A stioke ?', "The Avirtars fall over into a collective faint . Now I 've done it , Shannon thinks , and goes to the library , looking for the Squirt everyone calls Charon .", "A Virt full of Squirts imprisoned in their own mutually incomprehensible languages . Probably , Mike Chancey thinks , it 's some kind of karmic payback , since Shambhala is the cold-blooded capitalist shadow of a grand Utopian ideal . Immortality ! A life free of worldly pains and disappointments ! Girls girls girls ! Boys boys boys ! The power of a million supercomputers , all in your head , and all forever ! Except when it came time to get the thing off the ground , once it was possible every so often to render a working software approximation of a human mind , the dreamers ran afoul of the bean-counters . There was insurance to consider in the event of a failed Squirt ; there was the question of market limitations , given the price of scanning and upload ; there were legal questions about the           or virtual people , or whatever it was you were supposed to call them .", "Some caveat there , Mike Chancey is thinking as he walks           is : red and yellow lights on the Brain Board , causes and remedies of . He could answer both questions in about ninety seconds - causes , widespread collapse of energy infrastructure and reluctance of bandwidth outsources to continue to be bandwidth outsources ; remedies , dramatic downscaling including elimination of native personae and all spaces except the immediate environs of Shambhala -but if the meeting lasts less than three hours he 'll devote his life to God .", 'Discussion ensues . The Virt , it is decided , will survive the current troubles . At least sort of . People with loved ones who have done the Squirt , however , are getting agitated , and since the cost of the Squirt is orders of magnitude higher than the annual income of the average citizen of planet Earth , this agitation is prominent and must be addressed . A proposal is advanced : Might it be useful in a public-relations sense to provide an outlet for           Perhaps in the form of a lottery ... ?', "This argument carries the day . Now the problem is that to do what they 're thinking about doing , they need Alvin Kuntz . No one in the room relishes the prospect of working with him again , not after the way           Chancey sits silently , through the proceedings . He 's not surprised , except by the idea of the lottery , which is so profoundly stupid that only a vice-president of marketing could have conceived of it .", "Some kind of signal has gone out . Virtizens leave what they are doing and start walking , flowing in puzzled tributaries that empty into a few broad rivers of personae exiting Shambhala . They go in different directions , but with the appearance of purpose , as if they are being separated . It is raining tree frogs whose tiny bodies splash into fist-sized pixels when they hit the ground . Music is playing everywhere , and great curving snakes of lightning ripple through the mountains . Various parts of Shambhala appear not to exist . They 're like blind spots ; Shannon feels like she 's seeing something there but ca n't focus on it and when she tries the old trick of looking just next to the place , it does n't work because she does n't really have eyeballs . But wait           like she has eyeballs , is n't she ? She 's way past unease now , well on the way to panic , but it 's an anaesthetized kind of panic , yowling away in the back of her mind while her body walks calmly along a leafy side street . Sunshine dapples the sidewalk except where it 's covered in frog pixels . Shannon 's bones feel oddly magnetized , but she has no impulse to limp along with any of the main streams of exodus . Neither does she have any particular desire to know where they 're going , or where they think they 're going , or whether they have any idea where they 're going . Her mind wanders , but her feet stay on the path to the library , where she has heard Charon hangs out .", "On the keystone over the library 's front door is           there the last time Shannon visited the library , and when she enters the building she finds that interior is dramatically different as well . Usually an Avirtar is already waiting at the desk , but today the library is full of translucent blind men groping among shelves of books that reach up higher than she can see . At the far end of the room , she sees a door , and is walking toward it before she 's consciously decided to do so .", "The sound of an approaching outboard motor distracts Alvin Kuntz from the enjoyment of his daily cigarette . He pinches the coal off the cigarette , saving half of it for later , and goes around to the front of his house , which faces the beach on an island that was erased from world maps shortly after WorldWar II . He calls it Alvinia , and considers that in view of all he 's done for human civilization , he 's earned the distinction of naming a lump of South Pacific sand and coral after himself . The           the brain-scanning and personality-modeling work that led to the Virt , and incubated innumerable advances in nanobiology after the Virt 's establishment . That , Alvin reasons , is more than enough to excuse a little hubris , even though you wo n't find his name on any research papers or in any of the standard histories and even though he ca n't set foot on the North American or European continents because of certain indiscretions on the part of people who should have known better .", '" Get off my beach ! " he shouts . " There \'s no extradition treaties in Alvinia ! "', '" What bodies ? "', 'somewhere in the virt', 'The Avirtar - or persona , she \'s not sure-waves vaguely . " Around , "', "Shannon wants to gamble and ask if Charon can get her out . Even if she 's just piped back into a network where meatspace - the world - is visible again . Anything but this . Her misgivings get the better of her , though .", '" Eventually , " comes the reply . " Or maybe not . "', 'Alvin is getting tired of the interrogation .

They especially would n\'t fit if you wanted to put someone else in there . "', '" Well , not if you want them to be exactly like they are in the Virt , " Alvin agreed . " But who \'s going to know ? Will they ? "', '" Interesting question , " Alvin says . " We never did figure that out . "', '" Just get a sense , okay ? "', '" Tell you what , " Alvin says . " You would n\'t have this problem if you used them . " He jerks a thumb over his shoulder at the house .', 'Clearly this is going to take a while . Alvin lights his half-cigarette . " Soon as I \'m done with this , come on in the house . I \'ll show you . "', '" Alvinia \'s a free country , " Alvin said . " You \'re welcome to your opinion . "', 'Alvin chuckles . " That was mostly it . But also .... " He trails off . This is the part he ca n\'t explain to them , or should n\'t , anyway , because it makes him seem even more pathological than most people already think he is . But the plain truth - the real reason why he did it , and why he intends to do it again if he gets a chance - is that the world becomes a nicer place in direct correlation to how many of the moonpie idiots afraid of experiencing it are subtracted via the Squirt .', 'somewhere in the virt', '" Ai n\'t everyone who can write a double rhyming sestina , " adds the third , and barks .

And yet it waked me like some good pet . Its prow kept beating gentle against my upstairs bedroom wall . Spooked , I set my bare white feet ... into six inches of cold gritty water . I soon went headfirst out my highest window into a waiting boat . It was all so weird it felt natural . A 1970 outboard motor , untouched for months , somehow sputtered to life . Starting off I felt fearless as a boy . No streetlamp worked . Just a crescent moon refolding over currents as I chugged between treetops . " This is real , " I told my Evinrude \'s racket . " Dad \'s house is ruined . -Boat seems fine though . People probably stranded ... " Our neighborhood           lots , four-car garages , one canoe dock per home . This happened September 15 , 1999 , a North Carolina hurricane named Floyd . Winds , threatened all afternoon , proved nothing much-the unexpected sneaked in after dark . Tonight what first seemed silence became a million suckings , bubblings , gurgles . Instead of rain driving down , it was wetness , black , canceling us from underneath . Wind spares some things . Water , climbing , testing , claims them all . At least in midSeptember it was n\'t too cold . I sounded like my late wife : Jean was always finding the glass half-full . Now everything was . I motored our Alumicraft from house to major house . I made all my usual walker \'s shortcuts but now at roof level . The Hutchesons , half-dressed , on their third-floor turret , stood behind two barbecue grills blazing as signal pyres . I tied up to their Flemishbond chimney , calling , " Ride , folks ? " " Well , well , our favorite insurance agent . We covered for " acts           boxers , sounded amused . " Because just yesterday I paid a man twenty-six thousand for finally painting this doggone barn ! " Hutch kept gesturing toward water , hinting with his arms that it should split like the Red Sea . Hutch laughed till he coughed . His wife gave me a look . Their teenage daughter said , " Even tonight , Dad , you talk only about money , Dad . You \'re sadder even than this , " and she nodded toward our former neighborhood . We eased Hutch into my boat . Familiar streets seemed the canals of Venice , and we always had right-of-way . Humidity sogged your clothes then shoes . The darkness smelled of transmission fluid and ginger lilies . There came roarings from the distance . In a friend \'s sunken carport , his new Lexus acted mighty shorted-out : under five feet of green sludge , it ran every possible lighting combination , brights to dim to flashers , oddly beautiful , a dead loss . -Which neighbors were home , which home drowned ? We tacked by all three           trunks . They told us the mall was still above water , rescue trucks gathering there . These kids had surfed since age six and now , splashing off noplace , called back to me , " Is this not awesome , man ? " -For once , the word fit . I might \'ve shouted : " It \'s not some mountain stream you \'re swimming in . Our neighborhood \'s gone septic tank , kids . " But they would all three learn this later . I just let it go . You ca n\'t monitor everything . On top of a gazebo , Charlie Hague , four-time winner of our Top Golfer Cup , nursed the flame of his gold lighter . Kneeling in p.j. \' s , he stared out of an avocado facial . Tonight Charlie \'d actually forgot his Hollywood handsomeness . Face caked green , the guy looked like some Fiji headhunter , especially once in my boat . The Hutchesons helped Charlie and his tough-talking new wife down into our sixteen-footer . The wife rose behind him , pressing one finger across           letting all of Riverside see her ex-Marine CEO primped for usual beauty rest . -Charlie , as my late wife called it , " moisturized . " Moisturize ! Our mall lot , overlit by twelve generators , glowed the only brightness for whole square miles of night . Approached by boat , it looked like the shores of Heaven , I swear . I started dropping off my neighbors . Nine drowned bodies were already stretched beyond the dumpsters . Seven had been nonswimmers from the projects . People said not to worry , refrigerated trucks were on the way . II . I just kept boating back for more . Excellent-staying busy . Since Jean died , aside from my golf-and-coffee pals , it \'d been mostly me and the leading sports channels . One genius secretary pretty much ran my office . I had perfected Sitting on a Dock with Bourbon-and-Water , had brought that sport to new heights . Overnight , I \'d been shanghaied back to action . Odd , but losing everything made me feel decades younger . That could n\'t last . (           prediction ! ) My neighborhood stood two stories deep in ... well , in shit . Was n\'t this some early practice-form of dying ? And yet , at first at least , I felt alive because once more a little useful . Did n\'t know quite how this mess had happened . But , some way , I knew exactly what to do . Bart Tarlton waved a flashlight , signing I should boat on past , just leave them atop their carport roof . " Others will be by , and she \'s not ... ready . " He shined the beam on Caitlin , squatted , arranging soggy child-photographs across the roof \'s white gravel . " Cait \'s got lots of Saran Wrap up here . " Bart sounded sad . " She \'s busy sealing all of Carolyn \'s baby pictures . Keeps saying , " First things first . " -Thanks for stopping , pal , but we \'ve got to get through this part . Hell , where else are we going ? " He shook his head . " Oh , and           Sure glad your dad did n\'t live to see this . I know he thought the world of your house . " It amazed me that while his own wife sat playing dollhouse with baby photos , Bart would be imagining my father . True , this would have re-killed Dad . In 1950 he overpaid for our stone manse , guaranteeing my boyhood social standing . On a street known for its brain surgeons and college presidents , my dad was manager of Milady \'s FootFair . To make the fierce down payment on our 1939 colonial , he would gladly kneel half a century before Riverside \'s worst female feet . Dad \'s wish ? That I run wild with our Episcopal rector \'s delinquent ( if platinum blond ) sons . We did shoot hoops ; we raced our boats ; we took bourbon to a science . Still , neighbors never called Dad anything but " Shoe " Connelly . " Proves I know my stock , " the sweet guy smiled . He titled our house " Shadowlawn " ; painted its front door a           and funny , I knew to never claim much . Always sent these buddies home when Dad , back late from work , three vodkas in , started , " Best in town ? I \'d say young Diana du Pres has the toes of a Greek goddess . -Joy to see , touch , and serve . " Dawn came pink and gold but with many a wet and sorry sight . Numbers of drowned long-horned cattle-washed into town from where ? These stacked up under bridges like something from the Wild West . And on top of a pile of such carcasses out near the underpass ? Two live deer , a mother and baby , just stood grooming each other . I heard , " Mister ? Boat ! Mister Boat ! ? " Soon I wrestled onboard two skinny water-treading black kids . They \'d Australian-crawled clear from the projects . The weakest swimmer was looped within an inner tube he kept blowing up while kicking forward . Each tried shaking my hand as thanks , even while-with my bad back-I fought to pull them in           Kids were about fifteen and looked scared to death and we did n\'t talk much . I had a boat . They were in it now . Happy ending . With them settled , I figured I \'d go rescue a gal my age I \'ve always liked . She \'d probably be alone tonight : her dashing husband was two-timing her with his freckled college-boy " executive assistant . " Every local knew except maybe my friend . I sloshed toward her now : our generation \'s all-time Riverside glamourpuss . The face that launched ... at least one bass boat . Hers were certainly the feet that kicked off my Dad \'s praise . " White marble , " he announced , as Mom and I gave each other steady looks . But Shoe Connelly was right , she was perfect . Unfair advantage in a town this small . I hated loving the very one my Dad would want for me , for us . I lacked the looks , height , trust fund . Only had such access as Shoe \'d overpaid for . ( Dad           , an oar in the boat , the beloved ole coot , so naturalized he \'s colorless . ) And yet , even now , with me sogged and sixty , I still pictured my ideal , stranded on her second-story balcony , wearing satin like her " Juliet " in our school play . Figured I \'d go muscular up a vine , then bring her to my waiting gondola below , her satin frock pressed damp within these brawny arms , etc. , whatever . Pathetic . Still , I aimed her way . -I am a widower now . Churches , sunken as private homes , somehow looked sadder , having once claimed more . At least their steeples gave every boater bearings . As I motored past First Baptist \'s chromium upright , it showed a thousand steel rivets , a fuselage of copper flashing . Each steeple seemed just so much armor . Poking above our waterline , every denomination insisted on itself . In our Williamsburgy town , even the synagogue sports a steeple . Churches are often set face-to-face on corners opposite each           Wren minaret be long in coming ? -Ours is a God-fearing community . Afraid of what ? Plagues ? Wars ? Floods ? Looking clear downtown , I saw just trees and steeples bristling to the blue distance . And over all this , without form , and void , news-channel helicopters getting great shots of poor people clawing up their chimneys waving bedsheets . You did n\'t need to be a structural engineer to know that most of our street \'s fine old homes were done for now . You let a house , however well-made , stand in twenty feet of water for one week , that \'s curtains . The mold alone will kill you ever afterward . I sputtered past the Epsteins " pinkstucco Spanish colonial , the Murchesons " replica of Andrew Jackson \'s home , The Hermitage . In its basement rec room I \'d first felt a girl \'s breast , the left one only , but enough aplenty to interest me in life . Now I banked behind my dead wife \'s girlhood home . The breast in question had not ,           here among the camellias of her mother \'s formal garden , Jean and I married , June 1968 . Now around our altar-pergola \'s Corinthian columns , sewage bobbled . I chose not to Alumi-craft past my house . I recalled overhearing an old dowager say , " Those shanty Irish would shoehorn themselves into the biggest home right on the river . " Photo albums were most of what I wanted , and my bronzed baby-bootie that Dad made much of . Those , stowed in the attic , might still be safe . But for now I had people here ... The boys sat discussing friends : " You think they got Lottie up on they roof ? She say she could n\'t be leaving them kids but , still ... somebody bound to find them , maybe one these choppers ? Could be , this here City Man , once he finishes gettin " his folks out , might could go on back , fetch Lottie and her kids ... ? " So my passengers saw me as a town employee ! Paid to rescue them .           strange . ( Son of " Shoe , " after all . ) What had I expected , Life-Saving Merit Badge ? Did it really change anything-being assumed ? Till now had n\'t that been pretty much my life \'s goal hereabouts ? Unlike the boys " pals , most of mine got rescued by first light . Other Riverside boaters , using personal canoes , Sailfishes , and paddle wheels , had hoisted neighbors off their butlers " quarters , SUV roofs , pin oaks , and from the head of at least one life-size bronze St. Francis . My bass boat had retrieved maybe thirty to the mall when we finally sloshed into the yard of the woman I have loved since age thirteen . ( In fact , her left breast was my first breast , ever . ) Her Wright-style low-slung home seemed missing in action , but I saw she \'d breaststroked toward the only sturdy vertical around . I found our town beauty treed like a wet raccoon . Prediction so regularly fails me : For fifty years I \'ve believed she was maybe           thought our owning in Riverside outranked our lace-curtain Irishness , made us Lord Proprietors . Man never really guessed that " Shoe " is a servant \'s name . ( I fought to keep it from him . Of that at least I \'m proud . ) She \'d been born rich with red hair and green eyes so you did n\'t know if you were coming or going . Seeing how I and six other boys from the cul-de-sac loved her , she had promoted her plainer sidekick for my attention . She offered me the girl who let her copy homework , who held her coat and laughed at her usual jokes , the gal Friday who personally delivered her sarcastic notebookpaper come-ons to us sad hopeful males . One such note , handbrought , explained : Jean here is smarter than I and looks-wise grows on people . She has scads more money than I \'ll get ( even when Dad finally goes ) . And trust me , she loves you WAY more . Choose Jean , Mitch . I stared into the fine if simple           know how its contents had just shifted her future and mine . " Return answer ? " she , innocent , asked . -I smiled at her . I kept that note for twenty years . A town beauty always makes such matches for her handmaids . And somehow I had done as told . Was Jean also just following orders ? Dad , even knowing Jean \'s net worth to the dollar , still always treated her with fond pity . And yet our marriage proved fairly lively , forty years . Not a love match , maybe , but ... practical . We were really just best friends . I guessed at my own face \'s sketchy net worth . I \'d really wanted to head North to college , where my brightness-or goodness , whatever-might get me noticed as more than the byproduct of flatfooted others . My Jean had proved a wit , a " man \'s woman " regularly out snagging bass with me from this same boat . I had chosen well , at least , in picking the one who picked Jean for           , had all but disappeared . Not since our thirteenth year had I ever caught her without benefit of makeup . Now aside from orangenylon panties , poor thing was damp and bare as God made her . Coiled around a rough-barked pine tree , her white marble was curdled all over . " Uh-oh . That old lady she butt naked , " one kid observed . " It \'s okay , " I said . " I know her . " " Gosh , it \'s Mitch . And me hoping to be rescued by some handsome Yankee new to town . -But , hell , no secrets " twixt old friends , hunh ? " " Diana , " I nodded , as if greeting her at the club . I had a tarp in my boat and soon wrapped her with it . Her lips were blue ( the nipples also , truth be told ) . There have been years when I worried I still loved her more than my wry , quiet wife . This lady up the tree should \'ve founded Flirters Anonymous           long battle for her hand . III . What I remember best is how the flood confused or dignified our animals . Some little neighbor kids I ferried , they would have their Yorkie terriers wound in doll blankets or their tetchy Siamese cats along . I saw how it comforted even four-year-olds to take care of something still smaller than themselves . A dozen water moccasins tried crawling in the boat with us and had to be discouraged , but I could n\'t bring myself to crush one with the oar . You \'d just redirect them and hope they \'d swim against some sturdy log . A few birds were very noisy , as if sounding the alarm for all us other creatures , but most kept silent . They lined up along lower tree limbs , looking out and down like tourists . The oddest things floated . A yellow high heel . An oil-painted photo , some bride and groom shown smearing cake across each other \'s laughing mouths , its wooden frame like a life preserver bobbing them along . I felt more shocked by           collie ) , by all the swollen pigs and cows , by those clever living deer swimming here and there in a strange but mild-looking panic . By 8:30 A.M. , having found these kids and then Diana , I figured I had my boatful . Could reverse directions . Doing a last hairpin curve over the former Shady Circle Drive twelve feet under , I thought I heard shouts . The kids stayed quiet if with teeth chattering . Though teenaged boys , they kept their arms around each other for sheer warmth . Diana sat hidden within tarp , silent as royalty , looking out at all the water hiding her old holy stomping ground . She rested , staring in a clear and noiseless sort of way that made me remember why I loved her . The mall would have its bonfires , media , hot tomato soup . First I \'d just swing back by , check if Cait Tarlton and her photo show had been saved . Odd , it seemed that I , full of tidal surge myself , would always run this bass-boat           , this leg-up shoe-clerk service . I felt relaxed in ways that might have been hysteria or gratitude or both . Water seeks its own level . Without one real possession past my clothes , this motor boat , a wedding ring , I felt lightened , simplified . But also babyish , exposed . The damp fetus somehow sixty , out on good behavior . A nineteen-room house ? Dad \'s idea . Marrying Jean ? Some great notion of Diana \'s then Jean \'s then all of Riverside who loved us two sweet runts . " Good idea . Who else will they get ? I think they \'re cute together . " Surely now I could finally move on . We heard a terrible yodeling . It sounded pitiful but violent . I glanced back at my boy passengers . I could tell they dreaded whatever sight such sounds would bring us . I chugged across Hutcheson property , over Greta \'s beautiful knot garden spoilt in brown water beneath . At the corner of Carter and Shady Circle , in what was the front yard of           two young golden retrievers . Flailing , by now they were barely afloat . Dogs kept paddling in gulping circles , reduced to saving themselves by climbing up onto each other \'s backs . Nails and teeth of each had slashed the other bloody . Seeing help , they howled and , spastic , flapping , angled to face us . But what most struck us in the boat : Though water here easily went down fourteen feet , despite higher ground \'s being visible close by , these yellow dogs still made themselves swim-whimpering circles-right over their owner \'s yard . No wall , no street was visible , only drifting firewood and the dark free currents coursing everywhere . And yet both animals stayed put , treading the very water they were bloodying . On a playground twenty feet away , they could have saved their lives and rested . Instead , as if assigned one jail cell , pets spasmed back and forth , to and fro , floundering in that one brackish narrow . We called them and , treading halfunder , they gladly turned and           wanting help yet scared to come for it . One kid behind me asked , " Why they hanging there , Mister ? " I only knew while answering , " It \'s their " Invisible Fence . " They think the power \'s still on . So scared of one little shock , they \'re drowning right above their yard . " We slapped water , " Here boys ! " No go . The dogs " collars were fitted with electrical stunners meant to keep them in the yard . A triggering line lay buried , sunken . Just the idea of a jolt kept them trapped . Electricity citywide had been shut off since 3:00 A.M. Their owners were not home to help . I saw one dog had actually shed its red collar . Still the poor creatures stayed . They must have scrambled up the house \'s sides as water rose , then onto its roof , and finally out to the property \'s front edge . And here they swam in bloody goldfish circles these hours later . I tried explaining their security system           n\'t quite register the setup . It would \'ve seemed over-elaborate , wasteful in their neighborhood . Seemed that way here , too . Diana kept silent . I was now so glad for these youngsters " strength . As I watched drowning dogs go under , gnashing at each other , teeth chewing each other \'s necks , I started feeling sick . I went half faint myself-from motor fumes ? Maybe stress . Since waking to find my first-floor sodden-I \'d had a surge super-human , pure attention mainly for others . Heck , I \'d been in this boat for what ? six hours straight . Need be , just peeing off the side . But now I understood I had n\'t eaten since the night before , and then only a bowl of warmed-over stew . Could I somehow be a skinny ole guy suddenly sixty ? Oh definitely . And , considering another rescue-of dogs so crazed and young and heavyI felt myself go weak as water . Such gratitude now as four able brown hands ( ivory palms ) hooked the one poor creature           with damp loud thwunks into the bottom of our rocking boat . Soon as the gasping dogs were with us and safe on their sides , their tails , almost mechanical , beat three times very hard against aluminum . For a split second they looked over at each other . Just that once , but with such great joint effort . Then both fell dead asleep . This , of all things , shook me . Of every triggering sight today , this seemed so sad and wonderful , their being saved if bloody , their staring at each other to acknowledge that , then out . I could see now : one was male , one female . So , a marriage . But the way they \'d checked on each other before agreeing to lose consciousness , that was a true killer . I can not describe it well enough . But when I looked at the kids astern , I felt glad they \'d gone half wet-eyed , too . Pals sat hugging . Diana barely noticed anybody , gazing out at all our water .           . People always praised Jean \'s jokes and smile as " dry " -a holy word today . Should n\'t I have felt more grateful , forty years spent riding alongside someone so forgiving ? I \'d been the worst sort of snob-mine , a shoeclerk \'s snobbery . Now , finally qualified , I wanted my wife back . Now I was earning her . One of the boys saw me shaken . Polite , he waited a few minutes before calling , " When you done with this load ? if you still on the clock ? figure you could maybe take us back to where some our folks need hep , too ? " " You bet you . " With final prizes-three people and two live dogs , after all-I could head to higher ground . Our neighborhood smelled of raw pine sap so strong it burned your eyes like Lysol . You got a snootful of hog waste and this strange new scent , almost sweet . It was the smell of just so goddamn much water left all to itself and allowed to rush           a pinkish talcum ( dust flying in odd puffs as if fearful of becoming mud ) . But far under our boat , braiding currents pushed blackness over former golf courses and car lots . We squinted in the smell of what \'s wild . Freedom , chaos , everything let loose at once . It was something not even my greatgrandparents got to sniff : it was the smell of wilderness , doing all it wanted before any of us ever got here . -Doing all it will do once it has finally shed us . IV . Well , I just turned sixty-five . " Mitch \'s Boat People " they call themselves ? they threw me a surprise party . Antoine and Sam and Lottie and her kids were all there . Plus Diana , again looking forty-eight if a day . And the Hutchesons and Charlie Hague ( with his skin like a girl \'s ) . Before floodwater dropped quite four feet , I \'d already retired from Insurance . If you think that paying it is hard , imagine the torture of quadruplicate record-keeping           from my second story . ( Insurance had been Dad \'s idea : " Take advantage of our contacts , " Shoe said . ) The flood made me a thinker , made me mad , or smart . Not sure . Was it a breakdown afterward or some overdue insight ? Maybe all the above . A flood , after all . We \'d been on our own and somehow briefly managed for each other . There truly was no government . No electricity , no property lines . No houses ! There was whoever , in swimming distance , needed your little boat . One thing I know now : It \'s a privilege to at least try saving each other . It \'s also a full-time job . Riverside had been our one bluechip sure thing , the citadel everybody in this part of our state aspired to . Now ? it \'s a huge contaminated park , river view , not one 1939 " colonial " still standing . So much for American history ( a series of revivals anyway , I guess ) . Six           of people in Falls still seeing shrinks you would not believe . Me , I have a new lady friend actually . Total charmer , too . Must be doing little something right . I was spared owning even one stick of furniture worth saving . Blessing in disguise . And Dad \'s " ancestral home , " well-insured ? So much harum-scarum flagstone way downstream . These days I occupy a year-old maintenance-free condo , three miles from any river , thanks . I like it here . White interiors . No floral wallpaper . One table , one bed . I guess I live like a 1950s shoe clerk , strictly within his means . I live like a renter . Retired , I take three morning papers . From the Times to the localest , I read them religiously . Aside from Sports , I \'d let the world drift to hell in a handbasket . It sure got worse without my monitoring ! Prediction and leadership keep failing us . Is it as bad as it seems or does this just mean I \'m sixty-five ?           , must presently smell like Falls did right after the flood . These days , maybe only the old and semi-brave should even bother keeping up with current events ? Only those with boats ! Now I sit quiet and dryly puzzle out my whole career : the choosing Insurance , marrying Jean , not waiting for Diana , my old choices . Probably unadventurous to stay put in my hometown . And in that Founding Fathers palace Dad bought for me , one high heel at a time . " Never let " Shadowlawn " pass out of family hands , " he begged at the end . -Poor old Shoe . He died believing in American permanence . He did n\'t notice China waiting , humongous , behind us in line . He never guessed how fast we \'d squander our foolproof national inheritance . Finally , I can now live anyplace on earth . Some other locals my age moved en masse to bone-dry Phoenix . But so many folks I know are still stuck here , still getting over that one night . We \'ve become           . New kinds of people in my circle . These days , between us , so much can go unsaid . Since that night , I \'ve given lots of Jean \'s family money away . It never really felt mine . Now that I can really begin again , I seem to have chosen to be here . It \'s no longer my father \'s neighborhood , not Jean \'s or Diana \'s . There \'s nothing left of Riverside . And , see , that \'s what makes my staying put a choice . You can come to know your place , even this late in a life . Six years later , the swimming animals still agitate my dreams : I \'ll walk into a mall , our mall , and it has been sealed then flooded as if to make a skating rink but overfilled with floating scared wild animals , smelling not terrible but more like wet-wool overcoats , these creatures making no sounds except the frantic slaps of paws , the kicks of their hard hooves , splashing then knocking against mall glass ,           , terrified . I \'m left to guess : How many fences still hold me to this spot ? I am Mitch , sixty-five . I have been a loyal dog-paddler here my whole life . Overly loyal . To what ? Before our flood , my drink of choice was Jack Daniel \'s and water . These days ? I take it straight .

His name is Christopher . It 's fun calling him and the mothers ' rising voices are exciting and different ; it is a game , and also serious , and           almost all the places he might be-the front steps , under the willow , in his mother 's car , in the garage , in the old barn . Perhaps he is hiding from them , and Beth will be the one to find him . Then the neighbor and her son can go home and Beth can have her mother all to herself again .", 'Then it occurs to them , finally , where they must look .', 'It is a spot that Beth will never forget , that one spot in the deep end . He was maybe playing with a net which is floating in the water , he dropped the net and was trying to get it . People talked about this later , what must have happened , why he was near the pool , they had told him , they had warned him , also he knew how to swim , also he had been such a good swimmer last summer at the lake , also he swam even better than his older sister , also he had been a little fish last summer , also he was just in the house he was just here , also .', "Beth 's mother cries , Greg , get him , see if you can get him .", "That 's what he ate for lunch , the neighbor is crying , the water and soggy bread crusts gushing from the boy 's mouth and the boy does not look like the boy , eyes closed , face tight , hair plastered down , clothes plastered down , wet skin shining , limbs spread , vomit and water . Call           the house and call the ambulance , and the neighbor in her wet green suit and her stockings and her wet hair runs into the house and calls .", "The neighbor comes back outside . I do n't think I gave them the address , the neighbor cries , the street but I do n't know the number . Beth 's mother sends Beth and Greg to the front yard . Go wait for the ambulance , tell them where we are , wait on the front steps . Louis runs home . Greg and Beth wait , they walk up and down the stone path , it 'll be okay do n't you think it 'll be okay , they 'll fix him at the hospital , they have machines also in the ambulance when the ambulance comes the men will put him on a stretcher and they have machines inside the ambulance that can make him better . They have oxygen and shots they can give him . Greg tells Beth these things , explains to her how it will           wait , Greg 's arms and legs goosefleshy in the breeze , wet threads from his cut-offs clinging white against his leg , the maple trees making spotty shadows on his dark T-shirt . Beth is glad to stand with her brother who usually does n't come out here with her on the front steps where she likes to watch cars go by or kids on bikes . She thinks of Christopher 's house just down the street , a big yellow house with lots of yard and woods all around and a barn and even two horses . That house is probably empty right now because Christopher 's sister is playing at a friend 's house , and the father is at work , and everyone else from that family is here , in Beth 's backyard .", "Then the           wave at it as if they are on a deserted island and this is the ship that has finally sailed into view . They run ahead to the backyard to show the men where to go . The men are carrying bags and things and run clumsily . Greg and Beth wait on the patio . Everything takes a long time . Beth thought they 'd just take him right away . The mothers maybe could have gotten him to the hospital by now . If they 'd put him in the car . But the hospital is a ways away . Twenty minutes , maybe . Beth has seen it : a big brick building on a hill . They wait . After a long time the mothers run across the grass . Their faces .", "The mothers ride with Christopher to the hospital . Greg and Beth walk to Louis 's house . Louis 's mother has a gold tooth and brown worried eyes and wears a blue housecoat and speaks in a           bald rather wears a dark green uniform like the gas station man , his name sewn over one pocket in red cursive .

You just have to really believe and it will happen . Neither Beth nor her friend has ever actually gone to church or been schooled in the ways of faith , but now her friend is fervent and sure . Beth listens to her voice on the other end . She presses the phone to her ear . She imagines her friend sitting in her apartment , cross-legged on the couch .

How 's your day been ?", 'Outside : parking lot , grass , trees , cloud , sky , sky .', 'Time : 1940-1946 , any Friday afternoon or evening between September and June .', "At the center of the large downtown Green , a tall flag pole waves the Stars and Stripes high above a circle of seasonal flowers and various lollers-about relaxing on park benches here and there . To one side of the Green , just across West Main Street , a large handsome Roman Catholic Romanesque church , the Immaculate Conception , holds its high gold doors open toward the Green , the flag , the loiterers . If debt troubles this magnificent church , it certainly does not show . At           stands St. John 's Episcopal Church , stunning in its grey stone , doors locked except on Sunday .", 'While the presence , location , and relative number of churches may seem far removed from the learning of basic dance steps , perhaps it is not-or at least was not in that time and that place .', 'Friday dancing classes for children take place in this ballroom with its highly polished floor and its rows of straight-backed chairs along either side . Lasting one hour , classes begin at four in the afternoon , after school dismissal . As early as third grade , children may begin lessons . Parents anxious that their young fry absorb socially acceptable formulas of dance , deportment , and social discourse send their children here at the cost of twenty-five dollars per annum . Tap dance is offered somewhere else in town , but-despite the example of Donald O\'Connor and Fred Astaire-tap seems , at least for my parents , to lack sufficient social promise . At Miss Slocum \'s it \'s virtually guaranteed that by the end of grammar school your child will know the proper thing to do in a given social situation , whether or not she chooses to do           few steps and to the left , a cloakroom with racks of hangers and space for boots bustles with activity on Friday afternoon and evening as children are delivered by parents . Only at the final reception will parents be permitted to trip the light fantastic and survive a twirl with their own small fry or other prepubescent offspring . On that evening , niceties of " cutting in " and exchanging partners will be executed in an atmosphere at once cordial and reassuring .', 'As they shed their wraps , children laugh and talk and push and shove , bursting with end-of-school-week energy . Little girls display short dresses of velvet , cotton , and taffeta , white socks and gleaming patent leather Mary Janes . The boys sport dark blue suits ( short pants or long , depending on age and height ) , dark shoes and socks ( high for those in shorts ) , white shirts and ties . When the girls turn eleven or twelve and move into the after supper class           the boys will graduate to long pants . White cotton gloves , it seems , transcend age or gender . Spanking fresh each week , they protect against sweating palms and are rarely forgotten .', '" Walking in " is a big deal , a nerve-wracking liminal experience . It involves standing silently in line with the boy who has asked you to walk in with him , then going up the stairs together and into the ballroom where , just inside the doorway , you will be graciously           and her assistants , Miss Coffee and Mrs. Arnold . By this time , your escort of the moment-be he four or five feet tall-has made sure he knows your name . He takes your gloved hand in his gloved hand and holds you forth to introduce you to Miss Slocum-who perfectly well knows who you are . She greets you both by name , he bows slightly , you curtsy , he turns away and leads you to a chair along the sidelines of the ballroom , then sits down beside you . Even at this stage , he has learned to see his partner off the dance floor and back to her place . No cheese is ever to be left standing alone at Miss Slocum \'s Dancing School .', "You try to sit still , not your greatest talent .

Her face merges now with the face of Everywoman over sixty . But her dress , her stance , her manner , her firm steady courtesy , her patience           hair was decidedly not white but colored a mousey brown and curled ; she always wore a long dress with long sleeves , her feet and ankles exposed so you could watch and learn from them . Each Friday a large corsage decorated her left shoulder . She wore a hearing aid , which sent a thin dark cord down behind the collar of her dress . She spoke clearly , but never raised her voice .

A.J. shivered . It was six o\'clock and freezing , but the strong morning sun promised warmer temperatures . It had been colder than normal over the past week , and the ground and ponds were already frozen . " After we check on the cows , " Dad said , " you should have some time to practice roping . " A.J. flexed his fingers inside his gloves . His hands and wrists automatically went through the motions he \'d been practicing . He wanted to enter the rodeo , and had been working at roping and tying calves . The best professionals could break from the gate on horseback , rope a calf , dismount , and hog-tie the calf in less than ten seconds . So far , A.J. needed closer to a minute and a half , but he \'d only been at it a few months . The pickup bounced down the red dirt road , and A.J. began to warm up under the blast of the heater . In a few minutes           a pair of binoculars from the glove compartment . The black blobs of cows on the far hill took shape through the lenses . The herd was clustered around the pond . A.J. guessed they wanted the water locked under the ice . " Better check the tank , " A.J. said . The windmill-powered water pumps sometimes froze , leaving the cows with nothing to drink . Dad drove across the pasture . When he reached the thick bunch of cows , he leaned on the horn and began to slowly push through them . A.J. held a whip out the window , gently swishing it to encourage the lazier cows to move . As they crested the hill , they heard frantic lowing from one cow and an answering bellow from another . Dad stopped the pickup , and he and A.J. stared grimly at the frozen pond . A calf lay on the ice in the middle of the pond . A cow , no doubt the calf \'s mother , stood onshore , bawling desperately . The calf struggled to get up but slipped and fell           . Too warm . A.J. knew that the situation was urgent . If the calflay there too long , she could melt through the ice and drown . Dad eased the pickup down the hill and stopped at the edge of the pond .

A.J. carried a second rope with him to lasso the calf . It \'ll be just like rodeo practice , A.J. thought , trying to stay calm . He walked out a few feet onto the ice , then dropped to his stomach and crawled . The ice was thinner out where the calf was . She lay in a pool of meltwater. seeing A. J. , she scrambled harder to get up . " Easy , girl , " A.J. said . His heart leapt as he heard the groan of ice cracking . The calf continued to struggle , the whites of her eyes showing in fear . A.J. swallowed his own fear . With frozen fingers , he coiled his rope and made a loop . He took a deep breath , then threw the rope . It fell just short . As the calf bawled , A.J.           thought , inching closer to the calf . He stopped when he heard the ice groan again . A.J. knew he had little time . He focused on the calf \'s head , then threw the rope . Success ! The loop settled around the calf \'s neck , and A. J. pulled it snug . A.J. threw up his hand , rodeo style , to indicate that he was finished , and began to edge back toward shore . Once safe , he started pulling in the rope . The calf skidded easily across the smooth ice . In a couple of minutes , she was back on solid ground , where her mother was waiting . " Good job , son , " Dad said , loosening the rope from the calf \'s neck . A.J. \'s adrenaline caught up with him , and he did n\'t feel cold anymore . " I wonder what my time was , " he said shakily . Dad smiled .

Sidebar A.J. knew he had little time .', '\n Words would not bring Lila Feldhaus \'s son home from Pelton . During his visit Abner had waited for their words with toothy excitement ; knowing what they would say , he also knew how to answer them . A mother \'s power was and always would be in the elements , the things of the world . What would bring her son home ? Only a giant Van Buren ball at the county canvass at the end of October , one big enough to dwarf that Whig John Washburn \'s Harrison ball and dwarf John Washburn , too , and remind Abner where he belonged and whom he belonged to . The realizations woke her . Lila Feldhaus scraped the back of her hand across her mouth . Her husband Louis slept beside her , his thin lips laced with drool . Asleep , his breath snarled against the world like a hatchet against wood , but awake he was silent as a stone . She used to resent Louis \'s diurnal silences , but for the last few months , since Abner , only fourteen , left them to clerk for that Whig John Washburn , she           anything ? Her husband was a decent man , a Methodist , a steady reader of agricultural journals , a reliable Democrat . Long ago he had nailed up a campaign poster for an Andrew Jackson rally in Pelton . In the poster , Jackson looked cruel , black-eyed , almost Cherokee . Sometimes Louis spoke to the picture . " Kill you any bankers , today , Andy ? " But now Andrew Jackson was dead , and that Whig Harrison had the knives out for poor little Van Buren , and the world belonged to lawyers like John Washburn and not to farmers like them . Lila lay her fingertips on the jutting bone of Louis \'s cheek , not harshly , and he shook her hand away . " A man \'s sleep is his only peace . " Louis rolled over , facing the wall . Outside , the pigs scuffled , a goat whined , the tree frogs chirruped . Then , settled , Louis began to snore again , and the noises of the world fell farther away . The moon rising behind them           oak table to the narrow mattress where Abner had , until the spring , slept . On top of the mattress lay the red diamond quilt Lila had sewn for him , and that he had not taken to Pelton town . And beside it , the old wooden chest with a busted latch that would not catch , stuffed with clothes that Abner also had not taken to Pelton . Her son Abner had not snored . He breathed slowly , with casual confidence , as if he never expected to stop . Many nights Lila lay there , listening for Abner \'s breathing . Still she felt his presence in their house , a smell that did not belong to her or to Louis , a space that they did not quite fill . Lila slid her feet onto the wooden floor , already cool in the October morning . Digging her elbow into the straw , she pushed herself upright , sat a moment at the edge of the mattress , her hands on her knees , her eyes steady in the still light of the moon           woman , but she was , in moments of calm , impressive , even fearful . Abner was the same way , smooth-cheeked but already formidable enough to impress a lawyer like John Washburn . The very things Abner inherited from her had drawn him away from her , too . Walking past the table , Lila skimmed her hand over the white paint . When she reached Abner \'s side of the room , she grabbed his chest by the handles , tipped it forward and shook it until all the clothes he left behind , all the clothes that he was ashamed of , fell with soft thuds onto the floor . A buttoned shirt he once wore to Methodist service ( the Washburns were Episcopalians ) , two perfectly good cotton britches with only small patches of repair , a black vest Abner saw in Elmer Woods \'s store and begged unaccountably for . His thin dark socks . His white cotton shirts . His underwear . None of it good enough for him now . Lila dropped the chest on the mattress . Once Lila considered           rope wrapped around itself , like yarn into a skein , she saw what she would do . She tied the shirts arm to arm , the pants leg to leg , and began to wrap his clothes in widening orbit . By pulling tight and varying her angle , she could make , if not a perfect sphere , at least something that could roll . By the time she had tied all the clothing , the ball was about two feet high , up to her knees . She tucked the last pant leg , gave the ball a little kick . It rolled toward the table without unraveling , struck a chair that creaked and whined . Across the room , her husband Louis sat up on his elbows , blinked his heavy eyes . " John Washburn ai n\'t the only one who can make a show at the canvass , " she said . " And Harrison ai n\'t the only one who can have a ball . " Louis scratched his cheek , looked up at the poster on the wall , then back           enough to roll right over their goddamned Whig smiling faces , " he said . Lila looked down at the table , against the surprise and the joy she felt . In her excitement , Lila kicked the ball , gracelessly , and it bounced under the table and across the floor to her husband \'s side of the bed . " There \'s your Van Buren ball , " she said . By the time he was twelve , Abner Feldhaus knew that court weeks came once every two months , with an additional and brief docket clearing on odd-numbered Thursdays . By toiling through Sunday ( his parents willing to favor the oldest law of work over the relatively novel injunctions of the Scripture ) Abner could get far enough in the fields and in his schoolbooks to earn permission to attend court . During trials Abner wrote in a ledger he bought at Elmer Woods \'s store . At dinner he followed the lawyers to Frank Pool \'s tavern and carried their tankards to the bar for Frank Pool to refill . Abner loved words and the           ( and this was the reason he did not study preachers ) Abner admired the way that lawyers " words made the world different . One man fined , another sent to the stocks , a third set free . The soil his parents worked , though better than some , was often stone deaf to their pleas , but lawyers had a God \'s power to make people new . Abner \'s ledger was a record of the world \'s stubborn resistance , the shoulder it lowered to slow the lawyers " wheel of progress : testimony of adultery and drunken stupors and short-sighted incendiarism . Fat and walrus-whiskered with a swaying limp he blamed on gout , John Washburn was the host of the lawyers " party when it alighted in Pelton . One day , while Abner Feldhaus filled tankards at the bar , John Washburn snatched the boy \'s ledger . He read first quickly , then slowly , drawing his mustache under his lips . When Abner Feldhaus returned , John Washburn held out his hand for the tankard ; he drank , the rum           page . Reaching the end , he slammed his tankard on the table and bellowed at his companions , the leading Whig lawyers of seven counties . " My God , the boy eats words the way a horse eats oats . " He slapped the ledger . " They \'re all here , every word we said , digested and packed and squeezed tight . " A lawyer from Radcliffe pointed at Abner Feldhaus , who stood mask-faced but trembling . " You fixing to hire that boy before one of us does ? " he asked . " Hire him ? " John Washburn said . " I \'m fixing to sit on him and guard him like a hen does an egg . " John Washburn gave Abner practical work , the dull copying every lawyer needed , and a bed of feathers in a room behind the kitchen , a room Washburn and his wife had built for a son who never came . Washburn also gave the boy the speech he wrote and rewrote for the canvass in Pelton , when he would speak for           vote for Harrison \'s electors . But what Washburn asked from the boy was the truth , the awful sight of his own failed and fumbling words . Hearing them was like staring at the sun . Washburn saw spots ; he winced ; he needed to look away and retreat first to the bench in his front yard , where he rewrote his speech in the dark , and then to Frank Pool \'s tavern , where he forgot his limitations and his words and the boy in the back where his son should be . In the evening , Abner Feldhaus copied orders and depositions by candlelight while Washburn \'s wife and daughter sipped tea at the kitchen table a wall away . Celia Washburn , somehow cousin to Abner \'s mother Lila , was the most beautiful woman in the county , petite and pale-cheeked with dark hair that fell like river rapids down her back . Their daughter Prudence was perhaps the ugliest girl in the town of Pelton , not including the deformed . Birth had scarred her face , leaving a burnt red mark           and most of her forehead . Already , Abner understood that he was being held in wait for Prudence until he aged into the practice of law , in case Prudence could not find a husband on her own . The thought scared him and excited him both . Abner listened closely as the women talked . " Are the Democrats going to throw another of those dreadful whiskey orgies ? " Prudence asked . " Though I \'ll be sorry if Father loses , I will be even sorrier if it means the swine fiddling in the streets . " " Let \'s have a ball . " Celia was always eager to usher her daughter into public view . " Think of how it would help the campaign . A Democratic bacchanal or a Whig ball . " " A Harrison ball , " Prudence replied . " A big one , with not a Democrat invited . " Say nothing to your father just yet , " Celia said . " Let me start it rolling first . " Although Abner held to words the way a           always understand their meaning . All week the phrase " a Whig ball " swelled in his mind like clouds , obscuring the sky . All week he miscopied depositions , let oral arguments slip from his fingers like water . " It \'s your copying earns you your mattress , " John Washburn said . " You want to sleep there , you stay awake when you \'re in court . " Abner jabbed his nails into his palm , bit into his lip , let the pain wake him . That Sunday , Abner walked the four miles out of town and up the hills to his parents " farm . While his mother worried over his narrow wrists , his uneaten chicken , he told them about the Whig ball . Saying it , he felt a great physical relief , like a fever breaking in a slow sweat . He did not even notice his parents " scowls . " A Whig ? " Louis said . " Rather be a pig . Rather get stomped under some rich man \'s boot than choose to lick           \'s on the ticket , " Abner said . " The man who took me in . " " For four months , " Lila answered . " And who raised you fourteen years ? " Despite the argument , Abner felt calm as he walked back to Pelton . November was inevitable-Washburn winning the legislature , voting there with the majority for the Harrison electors , the Harrison electors riding to Washington , D. C. , and knocking out that midget Van Buren . Abner \'s father could n\'t change that . And the ball ? They would not even remember it . Abner \'s mind was cool , a basin emptied and clean . When he reached the Washburns " house , he fell directly asleep . Lila Feldhaus sat down on the ball . By scooting her feet across the floor , she could roll the ball and roll with it , too . But her feet caught , and she tumbled forward onto the floor . Louis helped her up , dusted her off with his hands . They stood by the table , laughing together           Louis \'s fingers tripped down her shoulders . Lila walked her fingers up his arms . Since Abner \'s birth , they had been together only infrequently , in stolen moments , court days , times when Abner was away . This time , Lila woke to the sun and to the memory of their first married nights alone in the house Louis and his father built . Noticing the ball alight with the sun from the far window , Lila rose from the bed . Digging through the linens she kept in her old chest , the one she brought with her when she married , she found the sheet that her mother and the midwife Anna Francis laid down upon the floor and fixed in place with buckets of water the night Abner was born . Lila had knelt there , small pillows under her knees , her face nosed deep into the sheet , her teeth biting a blanket , as her mother and the midwife told her push , girl , it wo n\'t come out on its own . Lila burned ; her mother and           them to let her rest ; she lay flat on the sheet and refused to move . She spat out the water they cupped into her mouth . Then , finding new strength in her anger , she knelt again . This time , whole worlds spilled from her , liquid and warm . And then the head . And then the white-shrouded baby , who looked perplexed a moment before starting to cry . The sheet still wore the memory of the night , three small red circles near the corner and in the middle a fierce black print the shape of a paw . Her mother had scrubbed the sheet until washing would do no more good , but the stains remained . Now Lila slid her fingers over them , remembering , and then she untucked the pant leg on the end of the ball , knotted the sheet to it , and wrapped the sheet in circles around the ball . The stain showed , which was right , she thought , a record , an at-last acknowledgment of the hurt . As she boiled water           under the table . She was shy about the bloodstains . But Louis , when he woke , squatted down and slid his palm over the ball . Then he reached into his own chest and found his town shirt , buttoned and long-sleeved , which he usually wore for market days or occasionally Methodist service . " How bout that , Andy ? " he said to the poster on the wall . " Real man do n\'t need no fine shirt . Though I notice you liked your fine clothes all right . " " Ai n\'t you going to wear that to the canvass ? " Lila asked . " I \'ll wear the clothes I am , " he said . " Not the ones that I am not . " For the first few days , the ball was something Louis and Lila Feldhaus shared , like their newly rhythmic conversations about weather and crops and sunlight , like their suddenly vocal lovemaking , like their sense-unspoken but deeply felt-that they now understood the world in a way no one else did . They skipped           sat on the wooden steps at the back door , watching the shadows overtake the last corn stalks in their garden . One day , shucking the sweet corn , Lila rubbed her fingers over the silk , liquid smooth but still solid . Instead of throwing the silk away , she sewed it onto a white pillowcase , which now glowed a soft and shimmering yellow , a thing as pretty and untouchable as light itself . Lila tied the case to the ball so the ball would glow , too . Seeing it as he came inside from his fields , Louis stopped his scrubbing at the basin . He wiped his fingers across his pants , touched her elbow with his dirty hands . The ball , glowing , seemed to be a new life inside the house . In the middle of the night , when Louis \'s snores woke her , Lila thought she could see it , shining under the table , though she knew this was wishful thinking . The ball \'s beauty would silence the fancy Whigs at the canvass , who           and expensive things . What did it matter if the Whigs " ball was larger ? What would it matter if the Whigs " ball was as tall as a house ? It was the beauty that counted . Lila and Louis said this to each other , too often . After talking it over , Lila shucked more corn , sewed the silk around the ball \'s circumference in the shape of the word " common . " In the evening , around dusk , that word " common " seemed to glow from the ball . It was perfect , they agreed . It was true . But then the widow Elizabeth Mackey called on them from her house on the far side of the hill , as she often did to escape her drunken , foolish son . Although Louis and Lila tucked the ball under the table , they could not lie in the face of her questions . The next day , Elizabeth Mackey visited again , carrying up her husband \'s cape , a black and frivolous thing that he had worn on the           got elected to the state legislature , voted for Andy Jackson \'s electors in the assembly in 1824 and 1828 . " Would n\'t he want to be part of it ? " Elizabeth Mackey asked . " Would n\'t he do it a little honor ? " Walter Mackey dead five years now , and still Elizabeth wore black . A memorial . Lila Feldhaus could not say no . They tied the edge of the cape to the pillowcase and wrapped it around the ball . It was so long that it covered everything , the pillowcase and the silk word , shrouded it all in mourning . Elizabeth Mackey laid her palm there . " Give those Whigs hell , Walter , " she said . In the evening the ball seemed to lighten , the black going gray , but Lila could not see the word underneath . " It \'s not beautiful anymore , " Lila said to Louis . " If it were me dead and not Walter , you \'d do the same , " he answered . Of course , Lila wanted           did not do it . The next to arrive was Edith Schermerhorn , who lived a full three miles distant and had never visited the Feldhauses at home . On the revival \'s last day , she had sat beside Elizabeth Mackey , two widows with the shared suffering of drunken sons , and Elizabeth Mackey told her of the cape and the ball . Edith Schermerhorn did not bring her husband \'s clothes . Nor did she speak of the Whigs . Her husband , like her son , had voted with the man who gave him the best whiskey , Democrat , Whig , or otherwise . Edith Schermerhorn carried a child \'s quilt . Her son \'s only child , a daughter , had died of fever , two years after killing the mother during birth . " She was a fussy girl , " Edith Schermerhorn said , " but we will never have another . For who would marry him now ? " Although Lila had her doubts-were n\'t graveyards the repository for sorrow ? - she held her quiet when Louis assented . "           . " I wrapped her every night . It was the only way to quiet her . " Edith Schermerhorn would not tie the blanket herself . When Louis tugged it from her hands , she covered her mouth with her fingers , watched him cinch it to the cape , then walked out the door , never to return . Lila Feldhaus tapped the ball with her foot . " It ai n\'t ours anymore , " she said , not with anger but resignation . " It belongs to everybody , " Louis said . " And we are part of everybody too . " Lila put her hand on his . Everybody was one of those words that did n\'t mean anything , that was just talk , but she did not care to argue with him . Jane Flowers brought her bonnet , an old sweated-brown thing . She did not care about big-bug politics , she said , but John Washburn had prosecuted her for making liquor from her own peaches , got her fined twenty-five dollars , which she would not pay . "           kills that bastard . " Jane Flowers tied the bonnet herself , tight , then sat down at the table , as if she expected to be invited for supper , which of course she was n\'t . A bridle worn by the late Sally , who was Michelle Matthews \'s favorite mule . A scarf left behind by Mima Fleming \'s daughter when she ran off to Ohio . A tablecloth carried by Jenny Abercrombie , whose husband was a notorious Whig . The tablecloth had belonged to her brother and had not been used since he stabbed his foot accidentally with a hoe and died of the resulting infection . Moccasins that belonged to a Cherokee woman . No one knew what sorrow they carried . A slave from the next county over , in the river valley where there were many of her people , carried a bundle two feet wide of shirts and trousers and robes , thin and muddy . She showed the Feldhauses her pass , written by her master , a Democratic legislator . As she unrolled the bundle , she held up           mostly Texas or Alabama . After she had handed over all the clothes , she rode off , not in the direction of her plantation . When the patrollers came by the next week looking for her , Lila and Louis said they had not watched her leave . The three patrollers gave Lila and Louis shirts from their saddlebags , claiming their wives had sent them . Two of the patrollers were bachelors , but Lila and Louis did not ask questions . A woman they had never seen walked all the way up from Lewisburg . Arriving at night , she slept on their porch . In the morning , the visitor would not speak to Louis but called Lila out to the garden . There she gave Lila the cloths she wore under her skirts , black with her dried blood . She folded them into Lila \'s hands and walked away . Lila stuffed them into crevices into the ball , jamming them where they would not be seen . " It \'s a world of hurt , " Louis said . The ball was as           Lila to lift . Even Louis had to strain . It no longer seemed precious and private . It seemed willful , as if the ball , and not the people who came to their door , were responsible for obscuring its core , the pieces of it that Louis and Lila had given . Sometimes they stayed inside when they heard the knocks , refusing to answer or even to look at the faces that peeked in their windows . Later , when Louis and Lila did open the door , they found stacks of clothes . Who could say what sorrow they carried ? The ball no longer seemed to glow but instead to throb like a heart , ignorant of all else around it . Although Lila and Louis still spoke eagerly of the impression it would make upon Abner and John Washburn and the Whigs at the canvass , they no longer liked to look at it . One night , unable to sleep , Louis rolled the ball onto the porch . In the morning , Frank Pool rode up from Pelton with a rag           , he fixed the rag into place and rode away . At the table , Lila and Louis ate their oatmeal , not even looking up from their bowls . John Washburn heard about the ball from Frank Pool , who did not understand its political meaning but thought it only a shrine , a foolish and superstitious thing that any sensible person might make use of . Frank Pool told John Washburn because he knew of Washburn \'s hurt , sometimes spoken , at being sonless , and also of Washburn \'s shame , never said aloud , at his daughter Prudence \'s face . Frank Pool walked the rum to the table where Washburn sat alone , reading his speech by candlelight , speaking words softly to the unresponsive walls . John Washburn was nervous about his speech at the canvass . Instead of easing his fears , Abner Feldhaus \'s unpitying transcriptions of the practice speeches Washburn gave during dinnertime had unmanned his confidence . He saw himself too clearly as others saw him , as a pompous , blundering airbag . So he whittled his words           John Washburn did not look up when Frank Pool set the tankard on the table , or even when the tavern owner began to speak . Telling John Washburn was a mistake . Instead of laughing at the FeIdhauses " foolishness or mourning his own unborn son , John Washburn pushed back from the table , tucked his ledger under his arm , and stormed out without paying for the two drinks he had already ordered or the three more he would have bought had he stayed his usual stint at the tavern . Frank Pool tapped his pocket , felt the absence of the coins there . " Goddamn Feldhauses , " Frank Pool said . John Washburn walked directly to the kitchen where his wife Celia and his daughter Prudence sat with their tea and their guest lists and the fabric they were sewing into gowns . " A goddamn ball ? " John Washburn said . " Can you tell me what that means ? " Celia Washburn sewed faster , not lifting her eyes or fingers from the fabric . Prudence cried out that it was           us , " she said . " You gave to this ball , too ? Not enough that the ignorant dirt-eaters want to celebrate the Democrats , but my own family , too ? " " Democrats ? " Prudence said . " They are n\'t even invited . " Celia Washburn kicked her daughter under the table . " We do n\'t have any idea what you are talking about , " she said . " He does . " Washburn pointed at the wall that separated Abner Feldhaus from them . " He \'s a goddamn spy sent by his conniving Democrat parents to undermine me . Want to know how to put together a ball of enormous size ? Ask him . And tell him if our Harrison ball is n\'t twice the size of his parents " Van Buren ball , he can crawl back up that hill and copy down the songs of chickadees and cardinals for all I care . " Although Celia and Prudence would have liked to forget about the ridiculous ball of clothes , they did not dare , knowing John           was expelled . They started with Celia Washburn \'s wedding dress , simple and white , and one of Prudence \'s fine blouses from last year , too small for her now . Unwilling to tie the garments together , they turned their thread and needles from their gowns and sewed the older clothes end to end . Mrs. Washburn \'s white dress shone like a tooth . The next morning , they placed a sign on the porch . " Drop off clothes for the Whig ball . " The first to comply were the vicious Barksdale sisters , who thought Celia and Prudence only intended to embroider Whig slogans on their lacy indigo dresses . Celia and Prudence laughed into their sleeves as they sewed them together . Then the Mayberrys and the Cotts and the Yanceys dropped their dresses , too , out of a certainty that the Barksdale girls could not have been wrong . When Frank Pool brought his favorite leather vest , Prudence - sensitive to those who did not mock her - gave Frank Pool a kiss on the cheek . The word           her brother \'s rug , which nearly sank the ball under its weight . Michelle Matthews gave her mule \'s old halter , Edith Schermerhorn a knitted baby \'s cap . Even Elizabeth Mackey brought her husband \'s favorite pants . " Would he approve ? " Celia Washburn asked . " It being a Whig ball ? " Elizabeth Mackey worried her fingers over her wrists . " He \'d approve of winning , " she said . " He loved standing with the victors . The defeated are forgotten as quickly as the Cherokees . " It seemed that everyone who had given to the Feldhauses gave also to the Washburns , except for the escaped slave and the liquor maker Jane Flowers . When the canvass approached , both balls were as tall as men , each too heavy to be lifted . People in Pelton saw the Harrison ball almost every day as they walked past the Washburn house , and its steady growth seemed a simple accumulation . But the Van Buren ball , four miles up in the hills , was seen only by           , and only for a few minutes at a time . At Frank Pool \'s tavern , when John Washburn was not present , men claimed that the Van Buren ball was as tall as a house , that it caused a deaf man to hear , that it shed tears every night at dusk . No one believed it , entirely , but no one said it was n\'t true , either . While his wife and daughter collected clothes , John Washburn discovered again his confidence , with the pride of a fellow who finds his pocket watch buried in a field . He had merely mislaid , not lost , something that was inevitably and invariably his . Without Abner \'s unmanning transcripts , without that sickening second sight onto himself , John Washburn began to speak more clearly , stare adversaries again in the eye , cower judges with his sneer . It did not hurt that his opponent , a Democrat incumbent from the next county , had reputedly fallen into despair at the escape of a slave girl whom he loved . A little           a fitting match for that midget Van Buren . John Washburn grinned into his cup , nodded at a relieved Frank Pool . " I \'ll unman that dwarf , " Washburn promised . During those weeks of preparation , Abner Feldhaus hid in his room , composing letters of improper length to John Washburn . Using all the words he knew , Abner wrote desperate and absurd stories , declaring himself a foundling deposited by some mysterious ( but probably Whiggish ) figure ( in later letters perhaps even Harrison himself en route to war ) at the doorstep of the hapless or conniving or greedy office-seeking Feldhauses . " This life in Pelton is the life I was meant to lead , " Abner wrote , " and they have sabotaged me since birth , to lure me into a world as silent as a stone , and will you allow them to sabotage me again , when you are the only parent I have ? " Abner apologized , explained , analyzed , denounced , and pleaded , but every morning Washburn tossed the new letters into           said , but Celia and Prudence had softened to the boy now that he , and not they , was the primary victim of Washburn \'s ire . They slid Abner plates full of bread and pork and gravy and , after the boy begged , ink for his pen and a new ledger from Elmer Woods \'s store . The day of the canvass , a dream of wordlessness tortured Abner Feldhaus . In it he opened his mouth , but he could not breathe . His pen , dipped in ink , failed to scar the page . When he woke , he felt gross and fat , like Frank Pool . The house was empty , he walked it as if he did not exist . On the table he found a note written by John Washburn . " Absorption is not the same as education , " it said . " If the Van Buren ball rolls over our Harrison ball , do not bother to return to my home . It is up to you to figure how . " Abner thumbed through the ledger           . It was true ; he had been only a copyist . Now , if he wanted to stay in this palaverous life , he needed to claim his place . The only way he could do that was by helping John Washburn win the canvass . In victory , the Whig would be magnanimous . In defeat , cruel . In the yard , Abner washed his face with water from the pump . The Washburn women draped a banner over the courthouse steps where the speakers would stand . John Washburn rolled the ball through the plaza , leaning forward and nudging it with his shoulders . He moved very slowly , and the ball seemed on the verge of falling backward . Washburn looked bleakly over at Abner but did not nod . Abner considered offering to help , but he knew what the answer would be . His duty now was to sabotage the Van Buren ball . Abner smelled roasting chicken . Soon the Democrats would arrive with whiskey and pork and fiddlers and their own banners , and then it would be too late           up the hill to his parents " house . It was really a series of hills , the lowlands shouldering their way ledge by ledge toward the distant mountains . At the first plateau he met Elizabeth Mackey walking the opposite direction , toward town , and then Jane Flowers on her horse , and Jenny Abercrombie in a carriage , and Michelle Matthews on her new mule ( also named Sally ) , and Edith Schermerhorn on foot with her drunken son . " You ai n\'t missing the show ? " they asked . " Or the grub ? " " Carrying my folks down , " he answered . Each of these people had given something of herself to his parents for their Van Buren ball , but they now seemed to have no concern at all for them . This surprised Abner , and then it did n\'t . On canvass day , they would deny the Feldhauses three times before the cock crowed , if they thought the Whigs had the better whiskey and the better meat and the better chance at victory . Abner           . He stared angrily at the steep road in front of him . Lila and Louis sat at the table , eating soup with wooden spoons . Their mouths were open around words they had been about to say , but they fell silent when Abner entered . It seemed to Abner that they had been sitting in that same position when he returned to tell them about the Whig ball , and when he left them for Washburn . They were not capable of moving . The ball sat in the corner by his bed . Seeing it , Abner felt a burst of relief . The ball was almost the size of the Harrison ball in town , but no one would think it the equal . It was caked in mud , stank of rot . It , too , did not look like it could move . Abner dragged his foot over the floor . Finally , his mother set her spoon in her bowl and looked up at him . It was an unhesitatingly cold look , one she gave the revival preachers and the           You coming ? " he said . " To watch your man get crowned ? " his mother said . " I think we \'ll stay right here . " His father nodded but did not look up . Abner bit back the smile that was growing on his face . It was clear to him what had happened . In their privacy , his parents had come to love the dumb , smelly ball . Having kept it curled under their thumb , they did not want to let it go , as they had not wanted to let him go . It was always the same with them , and only he could change . " You can stay , " he said , " but the ball goes . " He needed to get the ball to Pelton ; John Washburn wanted not to defeat an absent foe but a present one , not victory but humiliation . His father wiped his face with a napkin , then turned around in his chair . Abner walked over to the ball and pushed it . It groaned wetly           stood in front of him , pressing his hands on the ball . " It stays , " his father said . " It \'s suffered enough in the world , " his mother said . " What about the Mackeys and the Abercrombies and the Schermerhorns ? Did they give you their pain so that you could hoard it in private ? " Still , his parents did not stir ; they stood beside each other , fingertips lightly touching , two unbending fence posts hammered into the ground . Abner ground his shoulder into the ball , and began to walk it forward , into the door frame . Finally , it sprang onto the porch , carrying a plank off the jamb . " It \'s too heavy for me to push alone . " He sat down on the porch . " I might as well stay here myself because John Washburn will never take me back if I do n\'t have the ball with me . " This moved his parents ; his father nodded at his mother , and they both stepped forward .           ; on flat land their mother walked in front to slow its momentum . On the several down slopes , all three of them walked in front , leaning back into the ball to stall its progress , their shoulders pressed into the mold and pain and decay . When they reached the final hillside above the town , Abner and Louis and Lila paused by a cornfield . Below them the people sat on blankets on the plaza in front of the courthouse , eating the chicken and pork the girls brought around . On the wall of Elmer Woods \'s store , the Democratic banner hung : " The party of the common man . " Across the courthouse steps , the Whigs banner : " Progress . " There John Washburn and Celia and Prudence smiled amiably at the crowd , sitting on top of their own enormous Harrison ball , on which someone had sewn a small American flag . John Washburn , seeing them , clapped his hands together and pointed . Soon , the entire crowd turned to look at them , pointing and           caked in rocks and mud , a record not of people or pain but futility . " Here come your Democrats , " Abner yelled . " You can see what they are made of , now that they are here . " Below him , John Washburn clapped . Having said what he meant to say , Abner felt light again , incorporeal . He did not notice that his parents had taken his words about the arrival of the Democrats literally , that they had bent into the ball for a final push . " And now she is all yours , " his father said . They both grunted . As the ball passed him , Abner grabbed at it futilely , but the rag he caught - Frank Pool \'s - pulled loose in his hand , and the ball sped on , bouncing over rocks , gathering speed as it ran the last of the hill . It bounded once , heavily , on the road and then rolled through the courthouse plaza at a slow and sickening pace . Smelling it , people scooped           ahead , into the streets of Pelton . Several people sneezed ; someone else coughed so loudly he seemed to be tearing his lungs . By the time the ball died at the courthouse steps , the plaza was empty . A door slammed shut at Elmer Woods \'s store . Smoke began to puff from the chimneys of the houses in town . Celia and Prudence Washburn covered their noses with handkerchiefs . John Washburn raised his right arm to the dispersing crowd and said an empty , unheard plea , then sank down onto the steps , his head in his hands . Breathing in , Abner saw the words he might say , fragile as wings . Humiliated , John Washburn would never welcome him back . There was nothing for Abner in Pelton , or in words . He turned with a sigh up the hill toward home , and he thought he saw an inexplicable shadow of defeat in his parents " eyes , too , despite their obvious reasons for celebration , as they walked him back . Author Affiliation GREGORY P. DOWNS City    \n Hot season , 1973 , and Randy Cooper , whose father worked at the American embassy in Chiang Mai doing something that involved water buffalo , could not believe that David was such a dickwad that he had never ever seen a real movie in a real movie theater , indeed , had never seen a movie in his entire life . " I told you , " David said . He was twelve years old . " We used to live in the jungle . I mean , really in the jungle , where there was n\'t even electricity and stuff . I had a pet tiger . I told you . " " Still a dickwad , Tarzan . " With Randy Cooper \'s explosive " dickwad , " David realized that everything had changed . Since the family \'s arrival in Chiang Mai a little over two years earlier , David had been trading on the story of his adventures in the jungle , his account of the family \'s lonely homestead in the farthest reaches of northern Burma reaching a stirring crescendo with his account of his pet tiger . The story had produced big           ways " in the more skeptical sixth grade , until David produced for his classmates a photograph of himself with Elijah Cat in his lap . Aunt Helena showed me the photo : a bare-chested boy with a sweet goofy smile and an awful homemade haircut , sitting cross-legged on a bamboo floor with an honest-to-God tiger cub bent backward over his thigh . All four of the tiger \'s paws were in the air , and David was rubbing its belly . So it was all true after all . David had been enrolled in the fifth grade ( at age level , to his grandmother \'s pride ) , when they came over from Eden Valley , and through the end of sixth grade , that photograph , explaining David \'s oddness and proving his extraordinary pedigree , had been the difference between dorkhood and grudging popularity . But even the most wonderful story , told too often , loses the power to compel ; and David \'s , which was his little part of the story the Walkers told of themselves , now provoked only withering glances           had heard the jungle stories when David did n\'t know how to play dodgeball ; when he admitted that he had never heard of the Rolling Stones ; when he could n\'t ride a bicycle ; and when he was n\'t sure just who the president of the United States was-although David could have easily identified a dozen varieties of snake and pronounced them poisonous or benign , ably assisted in the construction of a thatch-and-bamboo home , identified all of the signs of the Rapture , or recited more lines of Scripture than anyone in school cared to hear , in both Dyalo and English . Indeed , by seventh grade David was no longer even the possessor of the most exotic story in class : Sarabeth Morgan \'s parents had been aid workers in Laos , and Sarabeth had grown up in a Hmong village , until the family was driven out by the war . She had seen a massacre , and had lost an adopted brother . She had arrived in Chiang Mai just this year , and her fresh stories made David \'s tales seem           to put the photo of Elijah Cat back in the album and begin to accept that Eden Valley was gone forever , and that he lived now in Chiang Mai , where people went to the movies if they did n\'t want to be dickwads . Not very long after his encounter with Randy Cooper , David decided to defy his father \'s unspoken but omnipresent code of personal conduct and go see the Englishlanguage movie of the week at the Kamtoey Theater , where was showing an entirely forgettable and now almost entirely forgotten blaxploitation film called Blacula , which the very same Randy Cooper , who brooded over the seventh grade like an incubus , the week before had said was so funny it almost made him piss himself . Thomas had never specifically told his eldest son that he was not allowed to visit the Kamtoey Theater , but David knew his father was far too subtle a psychological tactician to prohibit outright a forbidden pleasure . Not long after the Walkers arrived in Chiang Mai , Linda-Lee had begun reading Cosmopolitan magazine , which she borrowed           tell Linda-Lee that if she looked at that magazine one more time she \'d be headed straight to the burning pits of Hell , which in Thomas \'s mind was not very far from the truth ; but when he happened to notice a copy of Cosmo in Linda-Lee \'s book bag , the fifty-one-year-old Thomas began very publicly to read the magazine himself . Linda-Lee came home from school one day to find her father on the couch absorbed in an article about trimming the pubic regions , and at dinner with the whole family Thomas asked Linda-Lee if she had read that same fascinating article about how to seduce a man in six minutes or less ? The funny thing was , Thomas continued , that was precisely how Mom had won his attention all those years ago , and was it working well for Linda-Lee ? Linda-Lee went quiet as a puddle of water at the table . The very last thing the fifteen-year-old girl wanted to do was publicly compare her mother \'s quondam abilities as a seductress with her own . Can you imagine ,           this silliness when other people on this planet still lived as slaves ? Norma went tsk-tsk wearily , and Grandpa Raymond shook his patriarchal gray head from side to side . You could almost hear the bags under his eyes go swish-swish in disapproval . Linda-Lee wished that the ever-present gaping maw of Hell would swallow her up right then and there . So to go to the Kamtoey Theater , which if discovered would have subjected him to his father \'s mockery , David was forced to lie to his father , which if discovered would have subjected him to his wrath . In preparation for his first visit to the cinema , David announced to his mother that he had joined the swim club , which met from four to six on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons . ( Except at the height of the rainy season , when the pool , for reasons no one could explain , turned a violent cucumber green and widespread student opinion held that to dip so much as a toe in the water would lead to an agonizing death by slow-creeping gangrenous           if you catch my horrifying drift , a terrible thing which really happened to some poor kid in the tenth grade . In the rainy season , David thought it prudent to play volleyball . ) But attendance at athletic clubs was optional , and David explained to the swim teacher that he was expected that evening at a church youth group meeting . Thus having fashioned himself a solitary afternoon in the hot season , David went to the Kamtoey Theater , by bicycle , directly and absolutely alone , first dodging traffic on the Charoen Muang Road , then over the Nawarat Bridge , crowded with bicycles , motorcycles , trishaws , tuk-tuks , and handcarts piled high with bags of rice and cement , past the aromatic flower market with its mountains of roses , orchids , jasmine , and lilies , then into the old city itself through the Tha Pae Gate . The whole way there , David swore to himself that he would never forget the Dyalo again , not even one time , not when the hills which ringed Chiang Mai were throbbing           souls were crying out for liberation-although David did wonder just how two hours of swimming or volleyball , activities which no one disapproved of , would have helped the Dyalo . The question had bothered him enough that he \'d asked his grandfather what he should be doing to help the Dyalo if he was n\'t going out into the hills and preaching as his dad had done at his age . Grandpa Raymond had nodded in that slow , thoughtful way he had , and said that at the very least , David could pray for the Dyalo . " I take prayer extremely seriously , David . Prayer is often our most effective tool in the Fight . " David was impressed by the serious , manly way his grandfather spoke to him , and decided that he could just as well pray for the Dyalo in a movie theater as in a swimming pool . But the hard truth of the matter was that the very instant David settled himself nervously into the very last row of the Kamtoey Theater , he forgot his vows altogether .           racing and his skin prickling with a fine nervous sweat . He had a theoretical knowledge of film from his mother , who had told him that a film was like a photograph the size of a wall that moved , but the whole notion struck him as somewhat incredible . He wondered how he would describe the film to his classmates tomorrow . Maybe he would say , " It was so funny I peed myself , " although he was not precisely sure how a moving photograph would be that funny , exactly ; or he would say , " It was so scary I almost barfed , " although again , the connection was obscure , between a picture that moved and the kind of cold terror he had felt when , pulling up the bucket from the well not long before the family left Eden Valley , he had found a cobra spitting back . That discovery had in fact provoked David to vomit . The more David thought about barfing , the more he felt just a touch queasy . The Thai do n\'t believe           and rightly consider popcorn proper fare only for pigs , so generations of cinemagoers had come into the theater laden down with meatballs and grilled chicken on skewers , soaked with sweet sticky sauces ; salted dried fish from the vendors lined up outside the theater ; and bowls of noodles drenched in fish sauce , vinegar , sweet kaffir lime , spicy ginger , lemongrass , and galangal , the whole odoriferous concoction to be slurped down all through the show with the aid of chopsticks , whose click-clack against the ceramic bowls could be heard even at moments of highest cinematic tension . The red carpets and thinly upholstered seats had absorbed forty years of spills . The smell was overpowering , although to a nose not distended by guilt and anxiety , not entirely unpleasant . Later in life , David , wandering through the covered spice market or just passing by a street stall , would be instantly transported by a familiar smell back to the Kamtoey Theater and the sweet , illicit afternoons of his adolescence . David thought about going home . His butt           he had seen enough of the theater to fake it at school from now on , but not so much as to estrange him from his family . That was the hardest thing to explain to the other kids at school , just why he had never been to the movies . He had only recently begun to suspect that his family , in its enthusiasms and convictions , was different from other families ; and , indeed , the Walkers lived more intensely in the service of the Lord now than they had even in Eden Valley , treating Chiang Mai as little more than a mirage offered up by the Deceiver to distract them from what they needed to do . When they had first come to Chiang Mai and all of them were still living in a two-room house lent them by a wealthy Christian tailor , how admirably flexible in the face of adversity the Walkers proved themselves to be ! Raymond and Laura were more than seventy years old , Thomas more than fifty , all of those children , not one Walker speaking a           spent in the deepest jungle-and the only thing the Walkers knew for sure was that they would not forget the Dyalo ! " This was no accident , our coming here ! Oh no ! God \'s planning is coming together , and soon the Day will come . The wind of God had blown us down from China in the north , " said Grandpa Raymond . " And when the storm picks up , do n\'t you worry , the Dyalo will come running in for Shelter . We \'ll be patient like a seed in the earth . " * By giving those old enough to preach a goal , namely the conversion of the Dyalo of Thailand , Raymond distracted them all from the sorrows of exile . And all those old wild wandering Walker impulses , long suppressed in twenty years of jungle domesticity , came out again , to the exclusion of almost all other cares : Thomas , together with Uncle Samuel , Uncle Jesse , and Uncle Paul , devoted himself to learning these strange new hills . Talk at the dinner           villages , shamans who fought the work and headmen who-Praise ! -were coming close to the Light . The Dyalo in these hills were strange and different , their dialect outlandish , but the Walkers knew them . Even Raymond with his bad hip could n\'t keep from going into the hills and limping from village to village , as he had n\'t done since he himself was a young man , and when the men came down from ten days , two weeks , a month in the mountains , caked in mud , their faces were flushed red because they had felt His power . David did n\'t even need to ask what his father would think of his decision to see Blacula . If you have time on your hands , son , fray for those folks in Mae Salop . That \'s what his dad would say . David had almost convinced himself to leave the theater when the lights went down . He gripped the arm rails of his seat . The roller coaster rolling slowly upward , a plane in heavy turbulence , a           scrotum and cloaca . He wondered : Why had he bothered to lie to his mother ? As if God could n\'t see him sitting here ? As if God could n\'t afford a ticket to the movies , God who had made the universe ? What had he been thinking ? Why , he wondered , had nobody told him that movies were in the dark ? Then bats . That was the first thing he heard . From up above , the hysterical shrieking of a flock of bats swooping down from above , a flock of idiot bats who nested in the rafters of the old theater . Confused by the unexpected and untimely alternations of light and dark , the bats flapped and dove , as strange lights began to play across the screen , accompanied by loud music , which David recognized from school assemblies as the Royal Anthem . On the screen , the bright colors coalesced into the form of a man , and then a crowd , then dissolved and disappeared just as quickly , before David could quite decide what he           as his mother said : the screen was all one moving photograph . He saw the king of Thailand on the screen . In his anxiety David had hardly noticed the others in the audience , but now , looking around , he realized that he was the only one still sitting . He stood up . David knew that when presented for the very first time with a photograph , many Dyalo , particularly the old people , have trouble interpreting it . It would only be colors and lines to them . They would hold it right up close to their eyes and then far away , then upside down or sideways , and would call their wives over , and say , " Do you see anything here ? " and David would say , " Do n\'t you see ? That \'s a nose and that \'s eyes and that \'s a mouth there . " And still the old Dyalo just would n\'t get it , until all of a sudden , like someone examining those optical-illusion puzzles that show either a candlestick or two           and they \'d figure out what was going on-although each new photograph would still require long scrutiny before the " Ahhah , is n\'t that clever ! " moment . Now David found himself in the same confused position . There were photographs of the king on the walls of every shop in Chiang Mai , but this-this was another thing entirely . What his mother had never mentioned was that the photograph was constantly changing . The king would appear in one place and then in another , on the left side of the screen and on the right , an older man and a younger man , dressed in a suit and then in the ochre robes of a Buddhist monk , and then in a military uniform , and then in the elaborate royal gowns . David would only begin to figure out who the king was , and then the king would disappear again . Sometimes the king would move , but sometimes the camera rotated and advanced , even gained altitude and perspective , while the king stayed in the same place . There was           lady ; then the king in a military jeep . The king was driving , his regal face a study in concentration . Now the king was on elephant back heading up into the hills . Bats flew across the king \'s face . The king \'s jeep was driving toward the camera , and David involuntarily ducked and then a second later stood up straight again , feeling foolish . Then the anthem swelled to its dramatic crescendo and the screen went black . The bats who lived in the rafters of the Kamtoey Theater retreated to their nesting place . David sat back down in the dark , breathless . This was more than he expected . He had only seen the minute-long tribute to the king of Thailand that precedes the showing of every film throughout the kingdom , but David was confirmed in the very secret suspicion that he shared with every other thirteen-year-old in the world : that God and his parents really did wish to deprive him of the best pleasures in life . All this even before the show began . Sidebar Excerpted           Farrar , Straus and Giroux , LLC . Copyright c 2007 by Mischa Berlinski . All rights reserved .

My parents could no longer take delight in having their friends at the country club ask them about their son , the doctor , and found themselves instead , as my mother admitted to me , having to accept sympathies that sounded all too much like condolences . My father , when he was n't using his meager understanding of the concept of congenitality to attack my mother 's family , insisted-still insists-that something could be done about it if only I would go to the best man in the field .

According to the midwife , her mother split up the middle like a birch tree hit by lightning , managing to stay alive just long enough to see her daughter 's face lodged in the crook of her husband 's arm , eloquent of birth and glistening , before she died .", "Always , in that first moment as she felt her feet leaving the ground , Celestine would experience a combination of fear and delight . It was so wonderful to see the world from the air ! But what if her father were to let go ? Even while she felt his big fingers gripping her waist , she worried whether it could happen that she 'd begin spinning too fast , wrenching loose , rising higher and higher until the whole world would shrink to the           approaching the terrible face of God . For , the truth is , it was God to whom she thought her father was referring . Still , even from so high up , she could see the bottle-green heads of the ducks swimming on the Salzach , she could smell the sweet pomade her father used to make his hair lie flat . Soon , she knew , they 'd be sitting together on the riverbank , tossing crusts of stale bread to those same ducks . The ducks would quack , and her father would try to amuse her by quacking back .", "Celestine adored these children , though her adoration was that of the bird on the wing for its bright reflection in the windowpane , she did n't understand the tremendous gulf between her life and theirs . After all , did n't she , too , own a circus wagon with gilt bars , out of which she could lift a tiger painted yellow and black ? Not to mention the sly dancer named Loona-Maroona , whose jointed legs spread to accommodate the back of a star-spangled elephant . Because they were presents from her father , Celestine tried not to notice how the elephant 's tusks were cracked off at the roots , how the dancer 's legs were comically short in proportion to her torso ; how the tiger 's gaping mouth was toothless . But by the time she was willing to admit to herself that her father 's presents were nothing more than those toys rejected by his more discerning patrons , it was too late . The habit of adoration had been formed , altering only to           . Celestine came to believe , then , in the perfection of innocence , towards which she strived as if it lay ahead of her , as if the flower moved , inexorably , from the dissolution of late summer back to the green , stirring heart of the bud .", "So it happened that one afternoon in late August a soldier came to sit beside her on the bench . The nighthawks were beginning to stir on their ledges , all at once , like the dark appendages of a huge , reviving organism , its mute intelligence visible in the manifold lights of its eyes . But whether those eyes were lit from within -- the hausfrau rising on tiptoe to set a match to the wick -- or whether it was the effect of the sun going down behind the Monchsberg , spilling its gold across all the windows of Salzburg , Celestine could n't tell .", "Years had come and gone since the last time Celestine oscillated like the needle of a compass above her papa 's head . She was middle-aged -- an old maid by the standards of the day -- and already , at thirty-five , beginning to show signs of the deafness that would inform with heavy irony the final years of her life ; those years spent in service to the great musician Johannes Brahms , whose melancholy harmonies worked their way as if through cotton batting into her brain , where they suggested nothing so much as the unintelligible whisperings           plaster of her childhood bedroom wall , Still , her vision was excellent : indeed , Celestine had retained her ability to imagine the world from an elevated point of view . If she could see the Salzach 's flow darkening beneath its several bridges , could she also see all the way to Vienna , where revolutionary armies were converging , her own father among them ? Could she see Metternich as he watched his pretty maid sneak a sip of wine from the decanter ? Could she see him set his napkin fastidiously across his lap , only just considering flight to England ?", '" It \'s been a long time , " the soldier finally said , " since I have found myself in a landlocked place : \' His speech was polyglot , yet strangely elegant , as if not only had he spent his life traveling from country to country , but immersed himself in nomadic scholarship as well .

Among the Lapps , in the Finnmark , the flavor is more strongly of fish ; on the island of St. Kilda it \'s like when you stick a cut finger in your mouth .

" Paracelsus had the mind of the landlocked . It \'s not surprising he came from such a place , where men spend their lives prying from the integral alp bits and pieces of this and that . Do you understand ? "', "Celestine felt her fear of him close its hand around the little seed of her heart . He looked so much like one of her father 's clockwork toys that she found herself wondering at what moment , and by what invisible agency , the key had been twisted in the aperture . How carefully her father would lick the tip of his brush into a point , before painting in the pupils on a doll 's eyes ! The soldier 's eyes were terribly bright , and his pupils like the tips of pins .", '" That \'s what I \'d hoped you would say , " the soldier said . He stood up and took Celestine \'s hands in his own . " It was only a matter of waiting " he said , drawing her up from the bench . For the first time , he looked surprised . She was so tall .', '" Now you must climb " the soldier at last said . Courtly , he held back the branches of a fir tree , and Celestine could feel the tree \'s new growth stroke her cheek , its scent entering her nostrils and tunneling directly upward to a place behind her eyes , where it set off a strange , ocular jingling . Was it possible the path they climbed was composed of ants and bees ? Was it possible the soldier \'s hand was a single star in an immense constellation she was about to enter ? At first , alder bushes clutched at her skirts ; in time , they were replaced by cushions of moss and veins           way before : the outer part of her body having become the brittle housing for a substance alternately fluent and concussive that she decided must be her spirit . The floor of the cave into which the soldier led her was spread with bedstraw , so with each step her sense of division grew stronger , unable as she was to reconcile the sweet , milky odor of a meadow with the moist and decomposing odor of this hole where he apparently made his home .', '" The fighting \'s started " the soldier told her . " Now we \'ll find out if Paracelsus was right . " He pointed across the plain to where isolated puffs of smoke rose and dispersed , turning the pale blue sky a rosy brown , the precise color , Celestine thought , of the secret parts of her body . For the first time she noticed a rifle , leaning against the wall of the cave . " \' That which is above is one with that which is below , \' " the soldier said . " Or so Paracelsus wrote . Do you think that means God was corrupt when he made this world ? "', 'The soldier lifted the rifle and squinted along the sight , aiming at a squirrel that ran -- first partway up , and then partway down -- the trunk of a           jerked its head straight to the side , rotating it all around on the fluid joint of its neck , as if it wanted to be watching at the moment of its own death . " Do you love me ? " the soldier asked .', 'The soldier put the gun down , and stood up . " Then you should come here and kiss me goodbye , \' he said . " And when you think of me , it will be as if I \'d set out in a little boat across that sea of yours that used to cover this place , that filled all the hollows of this cave with its restless body . I expect I \'m about to die for a cause to which I \'m entirely indifferent . Do you think if I had shot that squirrel , God would have wept ? Still , I do n\'t think           weep for me . Those of us who \'re lived our lives where the world breaks apart into sand and salt and millions of drops of water know that the only immortality is conferred by the terrible human heart . "', "This was Celestine 's secret . Certainly her husband was n't aware of his wife 's private dreaming : her external manner had altered           good humor he misconstrued as solicitude . But the truth is that even on their honeymoon , as she walked hand in hand with him along the shadowy esplanade of Gmunden , watching the swans ' necks curve like question marks above the Traunsee ; even as she sat with him in the hotel dining room , nibbling the swan-shaped vanilla ice cream , prodding loose the sliver of candied orange peel that was the beak with her spoon-even then , Celestine was remembering the soldier .", 'Oswald Truxa survived the revolutions of 1848 , and his last act was to make each of his grandchildren a special toy , in each case bearing out their specific instructions . Max requested a circus bear , large enough to           convince her that a pretty , life-sized doll would be more appropriate , insisted on a wooden man . Nor would she allow Oswald to give the figure moveable joints . " I want him all in one piece ; \' she said , " like a stick . " Every night she took the thing to bed with her . My Baunchie , she called it , and Celestine had seen her waving it around in the darkness of her room , speaking for it in a voice that sounded like a nail being drawn from a board . " No , Papa , " Thule would say , sitting bolt upright whenever her father tried to pry her fingers loose from the figure as she slept . He was convinced it would bruise the satiny skin of his daughter \'s arms and neck , incapable of recognizing a strength of purpose greater than his own .', 'They moved to Vienna , to a large apartment on the third floor of No. 4 , Karlsgasse . This was a middle-class residence in the style of the late Empire , the vestibule stained red and blue and yellow as light seeped in through the panes of the French windows . Returning home from school in the late afternoon , Thule liked to submerge herself in each color , assigning titles to her days : " Today I am a blue girl , \' she would           with a soft intake of breath .', "Thule , on the other hand , insisted on complicity , and her passion was for the mutable . She always wanted the same story , but she would n't tolerate a predictable outcome . Originally , Celestine had been the storyteller , but little by little Thule took over , and Celestine could no longer remember the precise moment when the words ceased to come from her own mouth ,           was it the Baunchie who spoke ? Celestine could never be sure . Thule had outgrown her habit of clutching the doll , but it remained propped on a chair in the corner , surveying the room with its bright , nutty eyes . Whatever its source , the story Celestine listened to , night after night , was the story the soldier had whispered into her ear , so long ago , as she lay curled on her side , each small movement releasing the frothy sweetness of the bedstraw . And , though in its unfolding the story was always different , it always started out the same way :", '" But , " Celestine would sometimes remind Thule , " do n\'t forget that Fortune was with them . Remember ? For while we all know that Fortune is a woman , she is definitely not , my heart \'s darling , a mother . "', '" Beach plum and sedge , " Celestine would sometimes whisper , or , alternately , " Roses and lilies . " In the dark , small room , she could almost smell it : that odor of disintegration which she had come to associate with passion . Had Paracelsus been right ? Did creation really occur through corruption           would ask .', '" The second sister is the prettiest one , \' Celestine would answer , and then she would reach out to touch the soft crown of her daughter \'s head , to feel the thin line of the part . " So pretty , " she would say . But Thule would shake her hand away , impatient .', '" Love is boring , my sweetheart , " Celestine would say . " The second sister learned that the hard way . "', 'Whenever Thule came to the part of the story about the third sister , she would close her eyes and hope that it would turn out differently . She believed that this part of the story was not subject to revision ; she believed that the third sister was most like herself . The third sister was drowning ! Why did n\'t anyone try to save her ? But she was too far out , too far away to be seen by the watchful gray eyes of the first sister , her favorite ; too small to catch the attention of the second sister , of whom she was afraid . Green above , blackish green around her , the ocean opened into vast hallways where , on her coral throne , Death sat , her gills widening and closing           \'s sister . " Your sisters have killed you , " she said , " and I will tell you why . It is because you have always counted on them for everything . But now you will be my little girl , and I will dress you in flowing gowns of algae . At night you will visit your sisters , and they will finally learn how to weep . "', 'Thule fell in love with him immediately . She liked to visit him in his library ; to sit opposite him in one of his two huge armchairs with flowered covers , and watch him make coffee . Some days he would let her play with his collection of tin soldiers , of which he had boxes and boxes . Other days he would ask her to join him at the piano , and then he would play music so beautiful she could see his fatness peel back and fall away , and , like a needle extracted from a pincushion , a slender young man would emerge -- " pure as a diamond , soft as snow " which is how the violinist joachim described him , years earlier . His sense of humor , characterized as low-German by the biographers , eluded Thule . Once he sat and banged on the keyboard with his fists , explaining that he had done the impossible : written a sonata designed , once and for all , to exorcise the devil housed           wide-eyed , to catch a glimpse of the retreating hooves and tail , Brahms burst out laughing . " It does not do to believe everything an old man tells you , " he said .', "Thule suspected her mother would be angry if she knew her daughter was telling Brahms the story ; she suspected the story was supposed to be a secret between them . But with the passage of time , Celestine had changed . Her sense of the ironic , which had been leaking out of her over the years , was finally spent ; if she thought of the soldier at all -- and it 's possible she 'd given up thinking of him completely -- it was with the kind of surprised amusement we reserve for the follies of those younger than ourselves .", "It 's important to remember that Celestine married late in life , and gave birth to her children even later . Now she regarded her daughter 's evolving womanhood with something akin to fear ; when she came into the bedroom to say goodnight , and to make sure Thule said her prayers , she resisted the girl 's attempts to draw her into the story . Whereas with Max , Celestine felt capable of displaying the full range of her talent for motherhood , it was all she could do to bring herself to stoop down and kiss Thule 's face , as if , in so doing , she might stir memory into motion and , with it , the flattening winds of erotic possibility .", "The fourth sister was the only one with a name , and a life filled with domestic activity . Her name was Clara , and she was married to a brilliant and high-strung man , with whom she had six children . They lived in the same house -- still small when viewed from the outside , but unaccountably spacious the minute you entered the door . From its tall , immaculate windows , you could look across the dunes all the way to the sea ; had she not been so preoccupied with her love for her family , Clara might have paid closer attention to her other sisters . She was the capable one ;           sister from drowning . But she really did n't have the time . There was the ripped sleeve of Elise 's confirmation dress to mend ; there were the peonies waiting to be cut and arranged ; there was company coming for dinner , and the goose needed basting .", 'Thule smiled then , and nodded . After all , was n\'t this her own technique , her own desire to alter and embroider ? " Clara was a happy woman . And the household was a musical one . No matter what time of the day or night a visitor might arrive , there would always be someone , somewhere , making music . But then a bad thing happened . A man arrived , and he was very handsome . "', '" Perhaps . Everyone in the family fell in love with him . And he fell in love with all of them , too . Only , and this is the mysterious part , there was one of them he loved more than the others . The question is , which one was it ? "', '" But I would never do a thing like that , " Thule said . She was a little frightened ; the old man \'s eyes had become protuberant and lubricious , as if at any moment they might pop from their sockets like the eyes of certain tiny dogs . " Never mind " he said . " Go on . You might as well finish . "', '" No , \' Thule insisted . " The third sister did n\'t lure him to anything . Actually , she did n\'t know what was happening when she saw him drifting toward her . His long hair flowed back from his forehead , and his expression was surprised , just like he \'d always known he \'d come to her someday . "', '" Well , she was wron , " \' Brahms said . " Listen to me . I know the truth about what happened . It was the visitor who pushed Clara \'s husband into the water . It was the end of February , and it seemed like the snow had been falling for months . Robert was worse . When he left the house , around noon , I followed him . I watched the crazy way he moved through the streets . Sometimes he would walk right into another person , and then he would back up for several paces , waving his arms around his ears , the way you do when you \'ve blundered into a nest of wasps . I loved him more than I \'ve ever loved any other person in this world . When he stopped walking , halfway across the bridge , and stood there leaning over the railing , I pushed           the broad silver Rhine , icing over at the edges . Only , he never found the third sister . Not then . A man in a boat saved him . He was freezing cold , and shaking , and it was my punishment to have to watch him rest in Clara \'s arms , to have to watch him suck drops of wine from her fingertips . But he never recovered . A few months later he died in the sanatorium . Since then , I have grown heavier and heavier . And one day I \'ll be too heavy for this earth to hold me , and then I \'ll fall through the crust , and the sound I \'ll make as I fall will be real music . Do you hear me ? Real music ! Not this sorry excuse for music , this stuff for which I \'m admired . "', '" But there \'s more " Thule whispered directly into the old man \'s ear . " There \'s a secret . What you do n\'t know is that it was Clara who told him to do it . Clara told him about her sisters , especially the third one . She told him how the third sister knew everything there was to know . She told him how the third sister was shapeless and formless , like the wind blowing off the sea . It was Clara who wanted her husband to fall in love with the third sister . "', '" I \'m not so young , " Thule said .', 'Thule stood by the window , leaning her elbows on the sill . The stars were coming out , a star for each note the old man played . The melody was a sad one : small waves cupped the shore , their undersides a faint and luminous green , the exact color of the third sister \'s eyes . I \'m going to die someday , Thule thought . From downstairs she could hear Max \'s voice , shrill and excited           it be like to have ears that could n\'t pick up anything but the loudest noise ? If only her mama could hear the old man \'s music , maybe then the cells of her body would quicken , maybe then she would once again be able to listen . " I think , " Thule said , " you should tell my mama . I think when she brings you your supper tonight , you should tell her . "', "And then he received the letter from Joachim , telling him about Clara Schumann 's stroke . It was spring , and Brahms was sitting in the garden , his narrow torso sticking up like the tongue of a lily out of the bunched folds of a green lap robe , sunlight glinted off the large silver pin with which it was fastened . Thule heard about the letter as she helped her mother cut up vegetables for soup . Turnips , celeriac , potatoes -- Brahms , during the last months of his life , would eat nothing but root vegetables , explaining that only things which grew underground contained the liquids vital to his art .", '" Is she still alive ? " Thule asked . " Is Frau Schumann still alive ? "', "Thule put down her knife and ran from the kitchen . She almost lost her balance on the stairs , grabbing the banister just in time . Still , despite her sense of urgency , she paused for a minute in the vestibule : sunlight filled the small room with color , but she realized that there was no color appropriate to her emotion           that emotion . All she knew was that she felt like a lady 's long white glove and , at the same time , like the rough arm of a man , shoving into it , ripping it apart .", '" It \'s your turn now , " he said . " Besides , you have a debt to pay .           \'m some kind of machine , waiting to turn your nasty ideas into music ? I am a very great man , and you are a silly little girl . Your mother , at least , knows what it is like to be human . Why else do you think she turned herself into a stone ? "', '" The fourth sister is dying " Brahms said . " Do you understand ? It \'s not just the third sister who dies . And when the fourth sister is dead , then I \'ll finally be free to look for Robert . Only the interference will continue , of that you may rest assured . The music will be everywhere . It will be impossible to get around it , at least as long as I \'m in this body . And afterward -- that will be even more horrible .           lowest string , which is the sound your mama \'s chosen to shut out . But I think the truth is that \'s the only sound she ever hears . "', '" I \'m too old for explanations . Do you have a pen ? Your mother tells me your penmanship is excellent . I want this to be perfect . No blots . Nothing scratched out . Tell me if you think you ca n\'t do it . "', "The letter Brahms dictated on that afternoon in April never got sent . Word of Clara Schumann 's death came before the day was over : a terse message , delivered dispassionately by a young courier -- a boy , really -- who stood nervously scratching his stomach by the garden gate . Thule , however , watched to see where Brahms hid the letter , she knew that it lay folded at the bottom           escritoire .", 'Then , on April third , just as the piano teacher Anton Door was peering , with the bald effrontery of the healthy , at Brahms \'s head on the pillow , Brahms jerked : his two blue eyes glazed over , and two enormous tears slid down his cheeks . Would it have pleased him to know that his funeral procession filled the streets of Vienna ? Mourners came from all over Europe . Thule watched from the front windows of his apartment ; she did n\'t want to follow the six carriages laden with wreathes and flowers to the cemetery ; she did n\'t want to see the coffin being lowered into the ground . Instead -- at the precise moment when Pastor Zimmerman was pronouncing his benediction , " Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labors ; and their works do follow them " -- she removed           to the garden , where she knew her mother was sitting in solitary confusion . Then she made her sit still while she read it to her .', '" \' Here I am in Vienna . Every day I watch Celestine carry her yellow basket down the stairs , and I imagine the stairs rising toward me with each descending thump , and I feel my heart breaking under each thump of her big feet . And I think of him . \' "', 'Thule shook her head . " No , Mama , " she said . " But listen . The letter goes on . " It made her feel sad to           -- the same wink she \'d seen her throw other women as the pork butcher extolled the virtues of a particular sausage . " \' Celestine \'s daughter \' " Thule read , " \' is pretending that she \'s only a scribe , taking down every word , but she \'s devouring what I say . She \'s falling in love with him , too . She \'s watching him get up from the table , watching him kiss Julie on her cheek , on the place Celestine informs me is the part of the trout preferred by kings . I think she can feel it , the gloss of honey on his lips , a few crumbs . Maybe she \'s even figured out that the reason I chose a man \'s voice to sing the songs of those four serious sisters of hers , is because it is his voice . I hope so . I hope so because it \'s her fault that I \'ve lost him forever . Turned him into music and lost him . I resisted the impulse for so long . \'           Celestine asked . " What four serious sisters ? "', '" But that was our story , " Celestine said . And then she got angry . " It was my story . You did n\'t have any right to tell him my story "', 'Celestine walked over to a rosebush and snapped off a dead blossom between her thumb and index finger . " You , of all people , should be aware of the fact that I \'m deaf as a post " she said . " So it should n\'t surprise you when I tell you I did n\'t hear a word . "', '" A lucky guess , " Celestine said . Her arms hung at her sides , ending in the white knobs of her fists . " I did everything I could to make his last days comfortable , and this is how he repays me . " She sank heavily on           , like a manatee . Daintily she lifted her hem above her ankles , and extended one foot into the sunlight . " This is the foot of a princess " she said . " At least , that \'s how he described it , that night in the cave . Look ! " she said , taking off her shoe . " See how slim it is . Can you see how the spaces between the toes are filled with the thinnest webbing ? He kissed it . Here . And here "', 'She was still smiling when Max threw open the second-story window and leaned out , shouting , " Mama ! "', 'And so she was .

And no list of them , no catalogue . At the thought of so much vanishing in a night , she felt a sense of wonder .

Of course it was n't Columbus . It was Marco Polo , maybe . Books . Look it up in a book . Black and crumbling , holding their shape like a timed joke           The next day an insurance man gave her an inventory form . But why would I want to replace old spices and how could you ever replace a book collection , she thought .", 'Grace sat down once in front of the inventory form and a star of pain burst inside her as she began to read the list of household possessions , line by line , room by room .

She folded the papers and ran the side of her hand down the fold , again and again , and pushed it away , across the desk , like a plate of fatty meat in a restaurant when you \'re suddenly full . She picked up a letter just arrived from her oldest son . He was coming to Fairbanks to see her , he promised . Words on a page -- something to save , something to own .

A dustcatcher .", 'Her heart pressed against her breastbone ; she was suddenly filled with grief for the poor fifty-three year old widow who had lost all her belongings in a housefire just a few weeks ago . Poor thing , she thought , poor thing , and suddenly , like frosting on a cake , like sunlight touching the beach , her eyes filled with tears .', "She would be too tired to laugh , by then . She 'd just stand there , and feel good . What would he be looking at now ? She raised her eyes , to the mountains and the buildings . Look up , Grace , look where you 're going , look how lucky you are . To be seeing that . That mountain , that black bird looping about . She let her           office buildings . It swooped below the tops of the buildings , into a long , narrow gap of air , turned its head , and looked at her . Then , when only she could see , of all the people in Juneau , the raven did a mid-air rotation . Breast up to the sun . wings slicing at the earth . She almost missed it . Look what I can do . Then he was up , over the top of the building , and gone .", "Her fingers curled around the handle of an imaginary painting knife . I understand , she thought . As the crow flies . Ha ! We do n't know how they fly when no one 's looking . I bet they explore their element from top to bottom . They dip in and out .", '', '\n " Tell me . What do you see when you look out there ? All around you ? "', '" What else ? "', '" And if you look this way ? "', '" Okay , you \'re a smart boy , a college boy . Rutgers , is it ? "', '" Good , so you know this city . You grew up here ? "', '" You do n\'t sound like radio . "', '" I           I \'d go broke . What \'d they teach you in college ? "', '" Shminglish . See this studio ? " He did . It was , for a low-wattage station squeezed up at the very top of the FM band in a dying industrial city , quite a remarkable place . The chairs were leather , the walls were paneled in walnut , the lighting was soft , prints hung on the walls . At the receptionist \'s desk , a young woman , her blonde hair cut in a fashionable shag , was reading a paperback . She wore a leather bomber jacket , zipped up , perhaps for shelter from the powerful air-conditioning , which kept the air cold as mint . She was surrounded by a bank of phones and a top quality matte black word processor . There was no paper in the printer \'s feeder tray ; the phone lights did n\'t blink once . This place was unlike any studio , or even any office , that Adams had ever seen .', '" I did n\'t know you had your studio up here all these years . "', '" To be heard , not seen . "', 'Yet if the studio itself were any evidence , Zlotsky seemed to know how to make a profit from a marginal station in a weak market . Adams wondered how the profit could come solely from easy listening . As he looked out the studio window , prompted by Zlotsky \'s questions , he could see that , except for the housing projects off in the distance by the highway , there were no more than a half dozen high rises in the city , and there were only two skyscrapers . Most of the buildings were so small that , even if they had music piped into their elevators , you \'d have to ride up and down a few times to hear one side           boy ? " Zlotsky had stepped away from the window , and was now sitting at his desk , leaning back , clipping the end off a fat cigar .', '" Who \'s asking you to ? I know you ca n\'t , college . I do n\'t need you for this , all I need \'s an engineer to play this . It \'s just cueing tapes . " Zlotsky flicked some ash from his desk top , dismissively , as if to show his general disdain for all of this -- the music , the employees , the station itself . " I want something different midnight to morning , something , well -- what kind of music do you listen to ? "', '" Okay , okay , very educated . "', '" Motown . "', '" Pardon ? "', '" Even at midnight ? "', "Radio was Adams 's earliest vice . When he was a child , he used to go to bed early , sleep for an hour or two , then shake himself awake and turn on the radio , quiet , so that no one else would know , and he would listen in the dark . He would twist the set and jiggle the antenna to pick up baseball broadcasts in French from Montreal , then a midnight rock station from Buffalo , and then , if he could hold on long enough , early in the morning , he would tune in to the farm reports , clear as the wind , from some unimaginably powerful station on the Iowa prairie .", "In high school , he had studied the techniques of several top AM DJs , and prided himself on being able to identify the voice of each of the Seven Good Guys when they would do their WABC station promos or when they would fill in on a product endorsement . He knew their distinct styles -- not           Morrow or Herb Oscar Andersen , but the little idiosyncrasies of the obscure mid-morning DJs like Stuart Ullman , who hummed along with the closing bars of each record . He found himself , most of the time , listening not so much to the rock music as to the announcer 's intro or cutout , so that radio , for him , was a kind of reverse image of radio for everyone else .", 'Graduation , he felt , was much like signing off . He emerged from college just as he had emerged , hundreds of times , from the studio , as if rising into a world bright with danger and uncertainty , for Newark radio , smothered by the powerful clear-signal AMs of Manhattan , had developed a peculiar , somewhat unwholesome , ecosystem of its own , like a mushroom forest flourishing in the damp shadows beneath an oak . The only Newark station Adams had ever listened to , when he could find it on the dial , was the all-soul sound of Newark , WNRK . Something of a pirate station , long rumored to be sailing precariously on the lee side of the FCC and just beyond the reach of its numerous creditors , WNRK played exclusively black music . It would be on the air , seemingly going strong , for           vanish from the dial , like a ship that has disappeared around a point , to return , perhaps , a month later , more often than not at a different frequency and with a whole new crew of announcers . It was said that the station was run as a front for a millionaire drug dealer , but no one had any idea who he was , or even how to find the studio , which was rumored to be either aboard a ship moored beyond the three-mile coastal limit , or in an outbuilding on the grounds of one of the big estates up in the western hills .', '" Zlotsky \'s okay . He puts out a lot of rules . Most of them I can deal with . "', "The girl 's name was Evelyn , a name that she detested . She had a black cat tatooed on her wrist , and she thought Cat would be a good radio name . Adams agreed .", '" Why not ? To be piped into malls           voice that launched a thousand shops . "', '" Someone must , " Adams said . " It \'s pretty fancy digs he \'s got for a station with a negative Arbitron . "', '" I do n\'t think Zlotsky \'s in this for the money , " she said . " He \'s already made a bundle , in retail . Used to sell used lamps on Springfield Avenue , then he got into new appliances , electrical fixtures and stuff . "', '" I guess so . " This time Cat laughed . It was fun to talk this way about Zlotsky . " Whatever , I           It \'s an ego thing . "', 'Cat took a long swallow from her iced tea . She had left the tall spoon in the glass , and the ice rattled against it like tiny bells .', "Then probably , Adams thought , he 'll let me alone to run my show .", "Adams could n't figure out why Zlotsky had hired him ; it made about as much sense as asking Eric Clapton to join the Lawrence Welk Orchestra . WRNJ had been for years a steady beacon of boredom , spreading its thick waves of fat , bland music , like schmaltz , over the city for as far back as Adams could recall . Now it amused Adams to think of the loyal RNJ listener , falling asleep or settling into a lover 's arms to the sounds of Liza Minelli or 1001 Strings , shocked alert by Springsteen or Aerosmith . They would think that perhaps a wire had come loose in their receiver , or in their mind . These people he would n't hold ; in fact , Adams suspected that , like a junkyard dog , he might scare them off the premises forever .", 'After work , Adams would walk around downtown Newark , watching the first commuters , still half shrouded in darkness , descend from the buses at the Public Service terminal . Standing on the Macarthur Highway overpass , he would gaze down on the first cars streaming into the vast asphalt lots beside the railroad tracks , and he would stay until the lots filled . He would watch the office workers emerge from their cars , one by one , like beach turtles hatching from a mass of eggs           the slope from the cindery lot to the clean glass office towers , their natural habitats . They passed before him , the varieties of urban life : the secretaries in crisp summer dresses ; the lawyers and insurance men , heads down toward the gray pavement , mumbling to themselves ; an office boy rushing by , running a wet comb through his thick , shiny hair ; the blind man from the newsstand , moving as if in a world of his own , his white stick tapping the pavement before him like a long , thin bone .', "Adams would pass the morning reading the paper , drinking coffee at the counter at Chock Full o ' Nuts , then wandering slowly through the back streets east of the business district , along the Penn Central tracks . He loved the outdoor fruit stands and the second-hand shops on Mulberry Street , a street so badly neglected that the asphalt surface had been worn away and the cobblestones from the 19th century reemerged , like sleepers waking from a tomb , to serve again as pavement . The passing traffic made a pleasant clopping sound that could be heard occasionally beneath the insistent tinny beat of a Latin Calypso AM station out           of nearly every car that rumbled past .", "When it was hot , they would lie in bed through the evening , getting up only for lemonade or a bowl of sherbet . They rarely sat down to dinner , they never went out . Often they would talk through the night , and Adams would find that it was almost midnight and he had to catch the last bus downtown to get to the studio on time . Sometimes it was n't until he got there and cued the first record that Adams realized that he had n't slept since the day before . Strangely , he           in the morning he would stay downtown and watch the city come awake before riding back to Cat 's to fall into a dreamless sleep .", 'One morning in the fall , while Cat was immersed in her nails , with the station humming along quietly behind her , the studio door opened and a man stepped in , carrying a small parcel wrapped in brown parchment . He was a small man , with a sinewy strength , and he seemed to exude a kind of furtive intensity that immediately made Cat wary and uneasy , as if she had come upon a snake .', '" Mr. Zlotsky is n\'t in . Was he expecting you ? "', '" Sure , " Cat said . " But I do n\'t know if he \'s coming in today . He \'s not in every day . "', 'Cat shook her head lightly , a kind of diffident shrug of puzzlement . " Not really , " she said .', '" Yes , that \'s him . But he \'s not here , and I do n\'t know ... "', '" Was Mr. Zlotsky expecting you , " she asked him .           himself just outside the studio , his face halfshrouded in a silver cloud of cigar smoke . When the little chevron above the elevator doors flushed red , as if infused with blood , Zlotsky would step forward to meet his visitor , take him by the elbow , and usher him directly into his private office .', 'He set his parcel , thickly wrapped in several folds of butcher \'s paper , before Cat on the desk . She looked at it for a moment , and , when she looked up , he was gone . He had passed silently through the studio door and stood , hunched and sinuous , before the bank of elevators . Cat watched him until , with a ping and a pneumatic hiss , the elevator arrived , the man stepped into its cube of light , then disappeared behind the big door that closed           " Adams knew what he thought . They should open the packet and play the record , at least for laughs . Cat had brought the parcel home , for she had n\'t seen Zlotsky all day . She was n\'t sure she should give it to him , anyway .', '" For a nut , he \'s pretty sure about what he \'s doing . "', '" We never saw him at Rutgers , " Adams said . He took a sip of wine . They were enjoying what Cat called home-made rose , a pitcher of mixed white and red . Adams believed that drinking it made him see stripes , like a barber pole \'s .', '" Definitely . Wrong guy , wrong station , "           last thing in the world Zlotsky would want would be sounds of Newark . "', "Cat did n't have a spindle for 45s , so Adams had to try to center the disc as best he could around the 33 peg . Even after a few tries , he could n't get it quite right , and he could see the record trace a funny oblong shape as the turntable revolved .", 'At first Adams thought that the recording was a mistake , that the man had dubbed in the wrong section from a master tape , but then the sound began to make sense to him , and he thought that maybe this was a work of genius , an avant-garde composition meant to sound deliberately and aggressively amateur so as to express all the anger and confusion of           him that he had moved within , passed through , but never felt , never seen .', '" No , I think this is one of a kind , thank God , " she said . But Adams was sure that there was something to the sound . He held the empty parcel in his hands , turned it over , flattened the wrapping on the coffee table . There was an address , crudely written in black marker , just a street address on Passaic Avenue , and below that a little triangle drawn in pen . Beneath the triangle , Adams felt a bulge in the wrapping , and , when he pulled apart the layers of the parchment , he found between the folds a small , cellophane packet , stapled closed . It held about a spoonful of grainy , white powder . Adams put that in his pocket , and tore the address off the parcel .', "Passaic Avenue ran through North Newark , past the dark factories and the old , long-abandoned railroad freight yards , home now for rats and derelicts , and down into the marshy plains by the highway where the city 's most gruesome housing projects seemed to rise like obelisks marking the city           gave way to the chemical fumes , the spoors of industrial waste , and the pools of viscous ooze that seeped through the Jersey meadows . Adams had never before walked here , and now , even early in the morning , when the street was deserted , he felt threatened , as if the deteriorating sidewalk beneath him could at any moment give way and drop him , like a stone , into a sewer line or a sluiceway .", "The address Adams had been given , pencilled , barely legible , on a scrap of parchment           wholesaler tucked away in the lee of the projects . There was a good deal of activity around the meat company this morning . A truck in front was unloading fish and block ice , a big man in a white butcher 's apron argued with a scrawny fellow in a denim jacket . On the sidewalk in front of the store a lone man , somber and intense , wearing a new tan sports jacket too short in the sleeves and too tight in the chest , which made it look as though through sheer intensity of will he were growing right out of his clothes , stood in silence , holding forward in his right hand copies of Elijah Speaks !", "Adams did n't know . He thought he ought to tell the truth .", '" Music ! We ai n\'t got music here , we got meat , see ? Meat !           . " Adams stepped toward the door . " I do n\'t want meat . "', '" It \'s okay , there , brother , you come with me . "', '" You leaving with me , " the small man said .', '" Come on , man , I \'ll show you where to take that music . You ai n\'t the first , " the small man said .', 'There was nothing now but to go along , and , as they walked through the alley behind           ribbons of blood , Adams followed the man , like a pilgrim following a guide .', 'Inside , Adams was startled by the rank , sharp scent of detergent . The floor was slimy with streaks of soapy wash water . Probably a washing machine down here had leaked , or overturned . In the dim light that filtered through the blackened windows overhead , Adams could barely make out ganglia of heavily taped wires , pipes dripping with sweat and rust , and big tub-like furnaces matted with fibrous sheets of asbestos . As they passed , Adams heard scraping and shuddering sounds , perhaps rats or           man pulled a chain that lit a bare bulb , and Adams saw that they had come to a freight elevator . They stepped onto the platform , and the small man latched closed the door . As the elevator ticked slowly upward through the building , Adams watched the diminishing basement shadows , which seemed , as the bulb revolved in a narrowing spiral from its dangle of cord , to pulsate in the gently oscillating light .', 'Adams was surprised by the intensity of the morning heat . Up here , he could look , past the rusting air ducts and beyond the knee-high brick lip at the edge of the roof , too low           edge and , top-heavy , tumble down to his death , and see the same urban panorama that he had seen from the RNJ studios . But here , the view seemed , at least to Adams , slightly off kilter , out of alignment . Perhaps because the project towers were isolated in the north end of the city , downtown Newark seemed somehow far off and remote . Adams gazed at the distant parks , the wide streets , the factories with their plumes of smoke , the railroad tracks cutting across the meadows like a surgical scar , and he felt an inexplicable attraction , as if he were seeing for the first time whole a landscape that he had come to love in parts .', '" I work there , " Adams answered . He had been staring at the Commerce Tower . He had become used to seeing the city from the studio there , so the office tower itself had never been part of his view , and it           each of us knows so little about the intricate network of broken vessels and the small spots and streaks of color and blood in our own eyes .', 'He was looking at a small superstructure , a sort of corrugated construction trailer , propped on a bed of plywood and cinderblock in the center of the roof . Adams noticed for the first time , rising from one corner of the trailer , a spindly antenna bearing the initials , punched out of rusted sheet metal , WNRK .', 'Adams ducked around behind the studio , and saw a bulkhead door left ajar . Perhaps his guide had gone through there . Adams followed , pulling shut the door behind him . He was at the top landing of a long metal staircase that zigzagged down through the building , like a spine . He could smell piss and old cigarettes , the dank and rotten stink of cats and trash . When he peered over the railing , the skeletal iron stairway looked as if it were dropping away into infinity , like the diminishing images reflected in a pair of opposite mirrors . Adams began to scuttle           moved , and the echo of his footsteps rang and reverberated , intensifying like a piano played with the foot pedal held to the floor . The sound rose up toward the open bulkhead at the rooftop , like heat , and beneath it Adams descended , lower , lower , lower , like a piece of paper floating to earth , back and forth along the zigzag , until at last he lit on the concrete landing at the bottom , pushed open the huge steel door marked Emergency Exit Only , and stepped out into the daylight .', '" I did n\'t . I always wondered , though . "', '" You wondered what , " Adams asked her . " What kind of business Zlotsky           always figured there was something shady about the station . I wondered why he cared what music you played . "', '" What ? " The building seemed to shake in the wake of a passing jet . Adams repeated his question .', '" Yeah , but his other station does n\'t really have to make money . Not if he was using it as a front . "', '" I ca n\'t figure , though , why that guy left the sample with you . Unless he was scared or just wanted to make trouble . "', '          maybe , yes , to have a show of his own , through the night , alone in the studio with his music , and with nothing to do in the mornings but walk the streets of the city , and with Cat to come home to , he had found a version of paradise .', 'They could have gone , had it been possible , straight through past the dawn , but at some dark hour in the early morning , while the city slept and the stars were beginning to thin from the sky , Zlotsky stepped into the studio . He stood in the doorway , gross and dark and seething with pent anger , like a bear enchained , as he tried to contain his fury , to hold control of his thoughts and of his voice .', 'Adams took off his headset , and turned from the mike . " Do n\'t           . We \'re through . "', '" Of course . I saw him there . What , you think I \'m blind ? I saw him on the roof , I \'ve seen you two all this time , I know what goes on here , believe me . "', '" You understand nothing of what I \'ve said to you , " Zlotsky went on . His face was obscured behind thick gray streaks of smoke . " You think I care about music , black , white , soul , shmoal . No . It \'s a business I run here . I \'ve got business interests to protect . "', '" Hoh ! What you know about life I could fit into this -- " Zlotsky looked around , as if trying to find some object in the studio puny enough to illustrate his point " -- this finger . " He held up his hand , and the gem in the ring on his pinky sparkled in the greenish glow from the control board . He turned his hand , casting against the studio walls the shafts of light reflected off the facets of the gem , so that Adams felt for a moment as if he were at the focal point of a dark cosmos , watching galaxies wheel about , revolving through space .', '" So maybe you           , you like this music so much ? I have those boys work danmed hard over there . No air conditioning , no fans , no windows . They sweat . Is that what you want ? "', '" Listen to Mr. Morality . I hire you green out of college , I pay you well , I treat you well . So I give you just one rule -- and you break it . By which you \'re trying to prove what ? "', '" You do n\'t know what good is . You proved that . You had it good here . Everything your whole life has been too easy for you , so far . Even the girl . "', 'And then she realized , no , Adams was not going for Zlotsky after all . Adams stepped over to the wall and pulled the main power switch . The lights on the board dimmed , then dropped to black . The gentle hum of the studio machinery , almost inaudible during the broadcast , jumped to a high pitch , then a whine , then spun off the orbit of sound and into silence . The turntable continued to revolve , but ever more slowly , as the weight of the needle dragged it gently toward a state of rest . The station was off the air .', 'The drawbridge over the Passaic was still up . Even at this hour , barges steamed out past Port Newark and on to the sea . Over the railroad tracks and to the east , like a silhouette traced in pencil on the colorless morning sky , was the skyline of Manhattan , a boundary so vivid , and so seemingly intransmutable , that it almost defined , for all within its purview , the concept of horizon . Adams thought , once he had surveyed the view from the studio , that he never again would have such a clear sense of his surroundings , and of the limits of sight . And then , in the gathering light , he and Cat collected their belongings and in silence , but together , took their way .', '', '\n Dakota 1866-67', '" He \'s got hisself a big bunch of horses , " said the boy a little red-haired Irish kid . " Homely buggers , I \'ll tell you . He \'s feeding \' em potatoes out there on the ice . "', 'Back at the cabin he started getting his stuff together , remembering how his brother had done the same four years earlier . The prospect of leaving home scared him some , but he had taken about all he could from Pa . Things just kept getting worse . The old man           Half of it was natural craziness , the other half whiskey . He \'d call Leo down at every turn , and there were times he \'d scoot out of a dark corner and for no reason kick him in the ass . The only explanation he ever gave for doing anything crazy was " general principles . "', 'It was Ma \'s dying , Leo figured , that gave the start to these ugly ways , the old man muttering : " Yeah , you pestered her to death , but you ai n\'t gon na do it to me . " What ? thought Leo . I was only seven , did I pester her that much ?', "The day the pup was nixed Leo worked out a plan to shoot the old man from ambush on the trapline . He knew the perfect spot : on a rocky incline where Pa would come around the comer of the trail and stare straight into the muzzle of his own rifle ; and just before the bullet , see clearly his son 's tearful face .", 'They were wild range stock , said the boy , and some bought from the Indians . Or so it was said .', 'In the cold dusk as he came off the bluff and down into the lake basin , Leo saw that the kid on the bulltrain was right -- Knudsen indeed had himself a bunch of horses . They were massed everywhere in fie snow-covered landscape . Bands of a few dozen long-haired nags huddled here and there in the draws , and on the lee side of the small hills , where the snow was less deep . Some stood with heads           the frozen grass ; the dirty spots they had already worked over covered the hillsides like scabs . Several grubby men on horseback , who looked to have been recruited from the ice-cutters or the coots who trapped muskrats at the lake , plodded on the outskirts of the loose amimals , to keep them from scattering . The really ornery-looking broncs , Leo saw , were in makeshift wire and rope corrals along the road where it ran past the lake .', 'Big John had set himself up a headquarters in a ten-by-ten sod hut at the south end of the lake . In person he belied his name , as Leo already knew , being a very medium-sized man . He wore eye-glasses off which glinted the light of his coal oil lantern , and he peered at Leo as if shrewdly judging him           his old man .', "Yup , he told Leo , you got it right . He was indeed hi ring some good boys to take these fine animals out of Dakota over to the Iowa border , where , through privileged knowledge passed on by his Kansas City partners , he 'd been apprised of a prime market for quality horse flesh . Everybody was wanting good horses these days , Knudsen explained , did Leo know that ? The army was buying , the freight companies were buying , the express lines were buying , and by God , even sight-seers from the east -- Englishmen from England , for example were buying up the best horses for their western tours and excursions . The goddamned nobility was coming out           horses . How they gon na take their expensive tours without horses ? They Were crying for horses back there . Just yesterday Knudsen had got a wired message from New York -- Ship more horses ! It was , he trusted Leo would see , a cinch sellers ' market all the way . A blind man could make money ! A man who did n't know a horse 's head from its ass could make money ! Leo did n't know how lucky he was to get in on this extraordinary venture .", 'He shook his head sadly . " But I ai n\'t the man I was , and I admit it . Nope , them glory days is gone for Big John . Goddamn back give out on me , would n\'t you know ? A man like myself , too . "', "He 'd hired eight men , Knudsen announced . Leo would be number nine . And now that he was signing on -- he was , was n't he ? -- they 'd leave at four o'clock tomorrow morning . The pay , Knudsen had to admit , was damned generous -- a dollar a day and plenty to eat .           Cash money paid no later than the day following their delivery of the horses at Dakota City .", 'Saying no more than " We \'re set , " Cobb stood by as Leo rolled up his gear . In the dark Leo tried to size him up . He was tall and thin , no more than a halfdozen years older than Leo , and from what he could see as they came out of the hut onto the snowy path , looked stooped and pale , as if he was n\'t any healthier than           that family , like beaked noses did in his .', 'Leo said , " I guess you boys are in on this drive too . "', 'Having laid out the marching orders to Cobb ,           want you two boys to take up the back side here . Cobb \'s gon na head \' em out . " He motioned Chief to follow him . and told them he \'d ride along for a mile or two , despite the misery in his back , and get them over the toughest spots . The muskratters were chasing band after band out of the ravines and off the hillsides , and others sprung the ropes and wires of the corrals . For half an hour a mass of brown and gray and earthcolored horseflesh surged around and past Leo and Duwayne , who pulled up their mounts and watched the horses merge into a herd , with Knudsen and Chief funneling them on , Leo supposed , to Cobb and the other riders hidden far ahead . As the last horses came dashing up , Leo and Duwayne fell in behind . In front of them , the horses slewed and vaulted for footing , plunging through drifts that obscured the road . Someone yelled " Wahoo ! Yippee ! Git along ! " It was Big           back , too ; one scruffy old geezer saluting Leo as Buster slugged past ; the only goodbye Leo had gotten so far .', 'The sleet , having wetted him and Buster enough to freeze , stopped . It grew fully light , cold and gray . The air snapped in Leo \'s nostrils . The mass of horses was in a ragged string , a half-dozen animals wide ; he could n\'t see more than halfway up the line . With the light of day on them the animals nearest Leo revealed a shabbiness that bothered him . No doubt the pride           his horse toward him across the trail of smashed and dirtied snow . " What d\' ya think of these nags ? " he called . " See any you \'d like to take home to the old lady ? "', 'Duwayne hooted . " You bet ! " he said . " Some swell in fancy britches is gon na slap his little pancake saddle on that ? He pointed to a skinny , hammer-headed gray mare , her loose belly hanging , thick winter hair sticking at angles and scabbed with snow , and one chewed ear cocked wrong . She was n\'t much worse than her nearest companions . All of them seemed unusually small to Leo .', "Leo found that none of this came as a surprise . But yet he thought that surely there was some market for these culls . Knudsen was n't sending them off with only a hope and prayer : he could n't be fool enough to expect any horsetrader in the country to pay more than a nickel for these woeful goats .", "Duwayne pulled his horse over to let a few stragglers get by and Leo appraised the truth in what he said . No good reason to doubt it . He 'd heard tales about Frenchmen           . For sure , no one hereabouts would eat them . He had a vague notion that there was a law in the States about white men eating horse or dog meat , unless they were dying from starvation . Hell , then folks even ate their kids . But such a law would n't hold back a Frenchman .", "By mid-day the herd was well caught In a pattern of moving forward . The animals in the rear had the easiest time , the snow having been trampled into the semblance of a rough trail . Leo 's pony followed on this threshed-over road , scattered with dung and yellow holes burnt all the way to the ground beneath . Both Leo and Duwayne kept busy shooing back broncs that drifted to the side , testing their chances for escape . Later           .", '" Sure enough , " said Chief . The big collar of his coat was turned up , hugging his chin like wings . Outside it hung an elk \'s eye-tooth on a string . A length of old towel was tied under his chin and over his ears . He agreed . " We sure ought a have more than just us . I think Cobb \'s gon na hire some , if he can . I think his old man told him to . "', 'Chief looked at him to see if he was joking . " Nope , " he said , waving a mitten back toward Duwayne . " There \'s just us . "', "Besides being boss , it turned out that Cobb was also the cook -- at least he said he 'd do the cooking , but all that meant was he 'd get a fire going at nightfall and haul out beans , bacon and canned tomatoes from the sacks on the two pack horses he was trailing . Then he 'd tell Leo and the others to heat up what           supper , gnawing the half-done bacon he 'd heated in the pan he 'd made by cutting the bottom inch off a three-pound lard can . At least they had plenty of coffee , and Leo made it as hot a s he could stand , for the warmth in it .", 'Nobody broached Cobb about the missing six hands . It was as if they should have known better anyway . They each had their job , Cobb and Duwayne           rear . Trailing behind , they kept an eye out for likely mounts , since they hoped to spell their own ponies . Chief owned a lariat , with which he demonstrated a deft hand on a laggard horse , but they saw nothing they cared to ride .', "The breeds also had a half-gallon of whiskey up for sale . No trade . Cash money only -- unless Chief wanted to part with that elk 's eye-tooth , eh ? Chief was n't interested , nor was Leo , But as the hairy pair showed off their prize , Duwayne rode back .", "Leo shook out and admired his frayed robe , and wondered why the breeds had let it go for so little . The more he thought about it , he wondered if he had n't got the short end . Forgetting that the shaving gear was itself worthless , he vowed to keep a damned smart watch in any deals hereafter .", "Not long before Leo had been thinking that , cold though it was , they 'd been lucky with weather . Now he could n't see the horse 's ass in front of him , and he soon recognized that for all the wind and snow he had seen , here he was about to get the feel of them joined in a way to guarantee mankind 's misery . He pulled his hood tight , and kept a firm hand on Buster 's left rein , to keep him from swinging his tail square to the storm .", "With Chief 's help , Leo found the only half-protected spot to be seen in the roiling snow . It was a litlle stand of stunted cedars , shoulder-high , but with gnarled branches making a partial low roof , under which they threw their bed rolls . Fifty feet away , hardly a shadow through the snow , Duwayne scooped a trench in the snow alongside a downed cot tonwood trunk , well out of the wind .", '" Watch yourself , " he said . He had been distracted all the while they hunkered over the fire           of snow . " A guy can get lost in this stuff . "', "Leo had hoped the buffalo robe would make the difference in a warm sleep , but it was a chilled onagain-off-again doze ; and when Duwayne came off his shift and kicked him and Chief in the boots , he was ready to jump around to get his blood moving . The snow had n't let up a bit .", '" Out there somewheres , by God , " Duwayne laughed . " I doubt a man could miss the bastards . Jes \' follow their turds . " He disappeared into the snowy blackness .', "On their ponies , they moved in search of the herd . The wind descended In furious swirls , seeming to throw a woolly skirt of snow around them wherever they moved , as if they were the eye of the storm . Cautiously and together they moved toward where the herd might be , and when Buster floundered into a dark flank that leaped away , they decided they had found it . With Chief 's lariat joining their two saddles at twenty feet , they rode back and forth along a thirty rod line . As far as Leo could tell no horses tried to get past .", "They kept at this until the snow seemed to fall more brightly in one direction , a tracery of faint light in the east as day began . Out of this rode Cobb on his big mare that could plow through drifts where his Buster would valiantly flounder . He said he 'd spent the entire night keeping the herd from being blown away , had n't slept a goddamned wink . To the side of him , coming visible in the light through the falling snow , was a long semi-circle of humped shapes , snow-covered horses like a moon-scape of boulders .", "Leo nodded , that 's right . He could n't think about not trusting Cobb . Cobb sounded as if he knew where they were , and as the light grew through the snow , east was where it was supposed to be , and Cobb indeed had them pointed in the right direction . They were ready to pull out , except for Duwayne .", 'Duwayne had enlarged his trench into a small cave , Leo saw , with the overhang of the trunk as a roof , and in this hole lay Duwayne , although no part of him could be seen but his fur hat in the           .', 'Nothing for a moment , and then the mound trembled , the blankets beneath it heaved , dislodging the snow , and a guttural noise issued from under . In a ponderous move , Duwayne turned on his side and tried to prop himself on one elbow . Failing that , his head slowly came around , fur hat covering his face to the bridge of his nose and his coat collar turned up over chin and cheeks . Out of this poked his heavy nose , tipped white . His legs kicked against the blankets to send more snow flying ; then abandoning any attempt to rise , he was quiet . Leo swung off his Pony and bent into the cave . Duwayne opened his           , " he whispered .', '" Can you stand up ? Can you walk ? " Leo said , but he could see slim prospect of either . " Where \'s your horse ?           in misery , and he mumbled , his lips bubbling .', "For a moment he stood looking down at the stupefied face , the blistering cheeks , the white-tipped nose , on which the snow melted as it fell . This guy was nearly a grown man , older than Leo by three or so years , a lot further along the road . If this is where the wisdom come of his experience took him , God help the sorry lot of us , thought Leo . None of it made a picture that he saw himself in except at the blurred edge , where the artist had gotten careless . He could hear himself saying in his head , to hell with you , Duwayne , which he would n't say aloud : but it echoed in there .", 'Cobb would n\'t leave the herd , or whatever part of it he had found . He was frantic that they \'d never get out of this storm in decent shape -- in any shape and already he had lost no telling how many : enough for his old man to skin him alive . Dis-tractedly he listened to about half of Leo \'s story and then yelled , " The son of a bitch \'ll have to catch us , that \'s all ! Let him find his damn horse ! " His shrill voice popped out of the oval into which his hood was drawn , just space for his eyes and nose . Chief , listening beside him , wheeled his pony toward the herd , and disappeared .', 'This last Cobb yelled over his shoulder as he turned his mare to follow the rumps of the rear-most broncs .', "There was no answer from Cobb ; but Chief reappeared out of the snow and he was towing a thin , high-legged horse , a gelding with a little size over the others , who bore signs of a harness and did n't fight the hackamore Chief had thrown on him .", 'He was scarcely conscious . The two of them hauled him groaning out of the snow . " Come on , Whiskey Kid , " said Chief , yanking Duwayne up by one arm as if he had done this before . " You can handle this bronc . "', "Snubbed across Leo 's saddle , Duwayne , racked by convulsions , began to retch . Behind him , Leo was at first concerned and then disgusted . He could see Cobb 's point of view in the matter of Duwayne .", "With Chief 's lariat connecting the wild horse to Buster , Leo followed , uncomfortably bareback . Before long they stopped , and managed to get the moaning Duwayne wedged into the saddle , slumped forward over Buster 's neck . The wet collar of his coat had frozen to his cheeks , and while Leo gently pried the cloth free of the flesh           waist and the saddlehorn .", '" He must be froze down to his ass , " Leo said .', "Leo ached with the cold , the moreso as he looked on Duwayne 's misery .", '" Forty-rod whiskey , " said Chief . " You bet . "', "Mid-afternoon they saw Cobb again . The snow had picked up -- where in the hell was it all coming fro : n ? -- and the wind came in at           n't acquainted with . It all seemed to come out of some higher country , from farther north than before .", 'While he was talking he looked at Duwayne , hunched insensibly over Buster \'s neck , but said nothing to him , and after handing Leo the food-sack , he rode back " to keep tabs on the leaders " as he put it-which were horses , Leo realized , he had never set eyes on and he wondered what they looked like .', 'Duwayne moaned as they lowered him into his rocky corner . " Sons a bitches , hunh , hunh .... "', '" That \'s good for all night , " said Chief , kicking the slabs of snow off it . " If we can get her started . "', "Duwayne , it appeared , had passed out again . Leo nudged the drunken boy 's snow-caked boots and legs closer to the fire , but wondered whether that was right . If he was half as frozen as he looked , he was going to smart something awful when the thaw started .", '" Get on your horses ! " he yelled . " The bastards took off again ! " He sounded like an old woman yelling at her hogs and he was pulling his poor mare all wrong : she turned three times before he got her facing them .', '" We \'ll head \' em off ! " yelled Cobb . " Hey , you , Duwayne ! You ai n\'t drawing wages to sit around no god damned fire ! "', '" They headed south , the whole goddamn bunch ! " Cobb yelled pointing . Leo looked to where he pointed and thought , well that could be south : how , was a man to know in this shitty storm ?', "Leo set his pony to follow . The fire had halfwarmed him and now his cheeks burned again with the old . In his hand he still held the food sack from which he had been taking grub for their supper -- no sup per for anybody           to his oilcloth saddle pouch . If Duwayne was up to supper , he 'd have to make his own .", "If he had managed to stay anywhere near Cobb or the herd , nothing showed it now . Leo realized he could face any one of the four directions -- and here there might be five or more -- and it would all be the same ; he 'd see nothing but snow , if he could open his . eyes into it .", "A smart horse , Leo told himself , could smell its ways a clever animal that knew how to survive as well as a coyote . It took smartness to weather violent winters on the open range , one storm after another , and in April come trotting out with a four-foot tail and shedding hair in all directions , but still alive and full of beans . He 'd seen them . Horses were smart , people did n't think so , but they were           too . Hunkered forward in the saddle over the pony 's snow-clotted mane , Leo thought he must look like Duwayne , back there a ways with a big fire . Suddenly Duwayne was the lucky one ....", 'He could see no reason for it , but his pony seemed suddenly to step out with new purpose . Leo felt a moment of hope although there was nothing to support it . Indeed , it seemed gloomier around him , dirty gray beyond the swirling snow . It could be nightfall coming on , he thought , or some darker dimension of the storm working itself up .', 'No question , it was growing dark , and he almost felt like crying . He spoke quickly to Buster : " Okay , this is what we \'re gon na do -- "', 'Now he saw why Buster had perked up . The pony had headed into different country , taking a long angle down a draw , to get himself out of the brunt of the wind , and onto a lower slope where brush tops protruded from the shallower snow . They struck Let \'s boots as Buster waded through . Here he could see a few feet around him and the wind was not so fierce . But how far he had strayed from the track of the herd to get to           He was in a stand of willows and an alder or two , their tops a foot above the snow -- browse for the , pony . Without dismounting , Leo kicked the snow oft the top branches to see what he had . They might furnish a wall for a camp , if he dug down along the slender trunks . " Well , you gon na have something to eat anyway , " he said to Buster .', 'With dark it grew immensely cold . Leo knew there had to be more wood here than green willow . He was in a draw at the bottom of which a creek doubtless flowed In summer , and on it would float odds and ends of wood . A yard or two outside his camp , on the downward slope , Leo kicked and pawed into the snow until he came to the ice of small frozen pools , into which was embedded a variety of drifted pieces of pine , cedar and cottonwood the size of his arm . These he kicked free , his feet unfeeling ; and hauling them up the slope           him .', "He had slid his pony 's blanket from under the saddle and in this rolled his blankets and the buffalo robe to keep the snow out of them , and this made a couch for him by the tiny fire . The momentary comfort of it called into mind his immediate prospects : the dread hours of the night . No better in the long range : he 'd lose his job           Even if he did find Cobb , he 'd be fired for not keeping up with the horses . Nobody paid you for getting lost , even if it was in a storm , Damn ! And it was n't even nearly his fault .", 'In the dash of flames he caught a glimpse           as if hoping to come in . The snow had given him the beginning of a dunce cap .', "Soon he laid out his saddle blanket and on that his bed roll . The wood he pushed up to the fire would keep it alive for a couple of hours . He slapped as much snow as he could off his boots , pants and coat and , before he was plastered anew , rolled himself into the           to the fire . They would n't stay warm for long , but he remembered what his Pa often said : like the lady says , every little bit helps .", 'When he reluctantly pulled the robe off his head at dawn , he saw above him a flat slate sky . No           , but blessedly it no longer fell .', 'Uncovering the bits of firewood he had saved , he lighted a tiny fire and stood over it pinching his nose until he could feel it . It was no use trying to punch open a can of frozen tomatoes , so he thawed a thumb of bacon and melted a cupful of snow for a drink . The idea of coffee sat large in his mind as he sipped the warm water , scarcely better than nothing . But along with the bacon it set him up sufficiently to see some small chance in the day ahead -- if there were no more storms .', "By early fore-noon he had climbed out of the creek bottom and was high above and beyond his night 's camp . When he stopped to look back across the strings of blowing snow rapidly building drifts in every declivity , he wondered whether he 'd gotten turned around and was heading back the way he 'd come , toward where they had left Duwayne . It might be the best way to go , he thought . But as he turned Buster this way and that he saw the slope he was on could only take him east . Another ridge loomed In that direction and he bet himself that on the top of it he 'd see the herd 's trail , a big messy road in the snow ....", "Nothing looked right in all this snow . In his head he knew how this country was supposed to look , and it did n't look that way . Cobb was meant to be headed onto flat land , plains , a gentle slope a man could coast down all the way to Illinois , not anywhere close to these hog-backs and cliffs and ravines and shoulderbone ridges . This was no landscape where you would expect to see men , Leo thought . One man sure did n't amount to anything here -- or ten , or a hundred .", 'Here he was about as           to look around , once noting that he had come in sight of a dark fold running evenly upon an opposite slope . It ran , he judged , east to west , either end obscured by the fog of blowing snow . It had the look of a real trail , perhaps only an animal track , but if antelopes or buffalo used it , so could folks like him .', 'These were men on horses . Leo whooped and waved ; the first figure stopped , then the others stopped too . In a few moments they found him , and waved           as did his own .', 'They were soldiers , a detachment out of Fort Snelling to Fort Eden , carrying medicine , mail and military messages -- " the three D \'s , " said their leader . He pushed back his hood to talk to Leo . He was a man of about forty with a big mustache , mounted on a leggy black mare . He said he was Corporal Doggit . On mules behind him were four men about which Leo could tell nothing . They were trussed up in heavy coats or blankets , making huge lumps atop their animals , with no bare skin showing but for the blowhole at their mouths . Following them , were a halfdozen pack mules . Men and animals alike blew out clouds of steam as they drew toward the breathless Leo .', '" Dakota City ? " one of the men hooted in a high voice from out of the ratty fur around his pulled-up hood . " You got yourself a good ways to go then .

Fast talker , ai n\'t he ? Little-bitty eye spectacles . Sure . Did n\'t deliver worth shit . Come down to where the major would n\'t take his paper . I heard he left the country .

The animals had gradually worked their rears around to meet the sharp breeze , and the men sat enclosed in their wrapping , making no unnecessary movements , except one fellow with           they were soldiers except the U.S. brands on their mounts .', '" Four days , " the corporal said . " Your best bet is to go straight to Pipestone , then you got a good track south on the old freight road . "', '" Be there tomorrow night easy , if it do n\'t snow and I do n\'t believe it will . Boy , you \'d be better off by a long shot coming with           further persuading .', 'Leo wondered if he should make a correction . Only one hand , good old Chief . But he could n\'t explain now . Instead , he said , " I \'d be much obliged if I could tag along with you boys , then . "', '" I was wondering , " said Leo , " What \'s the chances of a fellow getting some work at the Fort ?

His job had got up and run away from him , but it looked as if he might land on his feet after all .', "Leo took up a careful watch of the northern slope opposite . He had firmly in mind what he would do if he spied the slightest mark of yesterday 's trail , the one that led to his willow camp ; or if he saw evidence -- any hint at all -- of the track he and Chief had made following Cobb and the herd -- if he saw any of these signs , then he could trace his way back to Duwayne 's camp .", 'But in that broad and snowy landscape there was nothing he recognized , and he followed the mules in cold silence .', 'By Lloyd Zimpel', 'My family had just relocated to the cold and -- according to nine-year-old me -- unfriendly coastal town of Westport , Massachusetts .

"', '" Si , una bella giornata . "', '" Gardener , " I said .', '" Are you watching the gardener ? Si , lo guardo . "', '" Cosa ? "', 'I looked down and noticed the way the rake handle was wedged under one shoulder , the opposite arm hanging limp at his side . I suddenly realized why he always leaned his tools against his chest to toss a ball to his dog , to wave . My friend gathered her sheets and napkins and clothespins .', '" Huh ? Oh yes , yes , " I said , but did not move .', 'There are all kinds of amputations and oversights in this world . All kinds of cripples . The water accepts them all without reservation , yet the solid world has little tolerance . Even Venice . At some point in the past that gardener must have been careless , inattentive . Just as Alessandro had been in that moment he shared a needle . Just as I was being careless by way of being too careful . Careful in friendships , love , you name it . Always keeping my measured distance , staving off not only loss , but life in the process .', "-- 7 Agosto . Near midnight . Spent the evening with Alessandro and his family . Today , his birthday . Thirty-five . His mother cooked all his favorites : risi e bisi , sarde in saor , peoci -- a fish fest . Aless 's brother was there too , all joking and laughing , and it was n't a nervous laughter either . No , he was choosing to be upbeat . True he is n't there day to day sustaining it , but still ... It makes me think this is how I should be for the rest of them too , how I could be reacting . And yet ... Every day Aless loses something ; a word , a phrase , the capacity           for another birthday . Looking across the table at Aless 's brother , , a thought crossed my mind -- that he too will soon be a brother left behind . The two of us , brothers in loss . And it occurred to me that in a way Aless had become the brother I never had . The brother I would once again never have . -- 8 Agosto . Worse today . He kept falling forward in the chair . Trouble drinking , too . He 'd breathe in , causing hiccups . So self-disgusted today , apologizing when wheeled back from the bathroom . I found myself losing it at the kitchen table . His sister , too . A nurse came this afternoon with shots , his arm already a pin cushion of bruises . Usually I 'm OK once I get inside the apartment , but somehow just could n't bear it today . That sad , half smile of his -- the paralysis hideous , mocking . That smell of ammonia , of death lurking . I ca n't do this . I ca           visiting another friend , an old retired stevedore -- Rico delle Scimmie , or Rico of the Monkeys as he was called . He lived with over twenty of them , not to mention a hundred or so exotic birds , a few turtles , dogs , dozens of cats , and the odd broken seagull or two which he 'd nurse back to health . To many , Rico himself was an odd species , but to me he was only a Fare one .", "Toward dusk we went indoors to feed ourselves . Meals with Rico were always simple -- cooked whole potatoes or rice , handfuls of clementines and dried figs , bananas , dates -- food plucked from the same crates that fed his animals . Rico ate with fingers half bent , like the monkeys themselves . A 27-inch television sat beside the table , which Rico kept constantly playing for a voice . Usually we 'd sit together and watch , now and then Rico talking back to the screen , cursing at all the politicians , the commercials , the Pope . That evening though , I got a hold of the remote control and found the mute switch .", 'He looked at me , swallowed some fruit , and after a moment said , " No ... Not much . Not even during the war when they were bombing . "', 'But death ? What about death ? "', '" But now I mean , do you think of death ? "', 'He said this matter of factly , and I had to laugh .', '" Ai ? "', 'On the television , soccer players ran across a field . Some were dressed in red , some in yellow .', '" Ah , the big question , " said Rico . " If you ask me , when you lose your senses you           priests tell you ? I do n\'t believe it , not in the least what they say . "', '" However , I \'m convinced that if they place you in the ground there \'ll be worms born . Little worms , without eyes or legs . Who knows what kind of life they lead , underground the way they are . You see them , you do n\'t see them . There are machines that can sense such things , but I do n\'t know ... but I am certain that if someone could follow such a worm that one day a bird would come and eat it and then shit you back down to the ground to fertilize the trees . Or else carry you back to their nest and feed their young so that one day you can fly . Either way , you join all the rest . The animals , the trees , the air , the water ... this is another thought , more than death . "', 'As a youngster , I remember how each year on the first day back to school the teacher would scratch the words " what I did on my summer vacation " onto the blackboard , then promptly hand out construction paper . There would always be colorful pictures drawn , filled with cars and swimming pools , watermelons , flowers . Yet as we grew older , all the crayons and magic markers turned into No. 2           Thinking about all the novels and novellas set in Venice , what I envision above all else is a theme of morbidity . Stories plagued by the macabre or decadence or , at the very least , intrigue . Certainly a sadness . The colors mostly white on white , blacks , greys . Maybe a deep red here or there . A midnight blue . Meanwhile , the painters of Venice , who must carry the same doubts and longings as writers , ca n\'t deny themselves a wider palette . Their garret studios , howsoever remote , must let in light and its prism of colors . They can not enclose themselves nor their work within . At worst , there is chiaroscuro .', '-- 10 Agosto . Aless seemed a little better today . Moments of clarity . Presence . Noticed how his long-term memory seems more intact . And in effect , this is what we have to share , more past than present . As for the future ? Well , less than two days till I leave . Strange , now wishing there was more time . We \'re still only halfway through The Little Prince . -- 11 Agosto . He was sleeping when I visited this morning , so I just sat beside the bed . Started sketching his body -- the lost tone , the dead right arm ... the wheelchair and the room ... his old schoolbooks on the shelf , wooden pull toys , boxes of medicine on the nighttable ... " What is essential is invisible to the eye , " the little prince repeated , so that he would be sure to remember . Later in the kitchen , stood beside his mother at the window           the wet sheets and bedclothes then pulled on the pulley to release them to the wind . Outside shone ceramic rooftops and steeples . I wondered if she knew Alessandro wanted to be cremated and have his ashes spread into the lagoon . Out onto the water .', "Still , it struck me that despite the distance there was a bridge between the boat and my eye . I could see it and it could see me , or if not me specifically , at least the shore . For though a vessel 's prow may yearn for the open waves its stern must watch the shore recede . And even if it were to drift out beyond sight , I still knew it was there just as the boat would still be connected to the shoreline , for there is no being at sea without a shore . There is no amputation then . Memory , not only a shipwreck , but a harbor to return to again and again . A shoebox . A photograph . A face frozen in time . A crippled heart waiting to beat anew . There is no loss without gain , I thought . There is no loss in truth , only gain .", 'Soon the evening sky offered up its constellations , its black holes , its worm holes           were turning on one by one all over Venice . The jewel of the Adriatic igniting her palaces and bell towers , her stone white bridges . Her Bridge of Sighs . And standing there , I swear I felt something rise up out of my chest . Something that broke free and let go . Unconsciously , I took a step toward the edge of the water .', 'He asked me to help place him in his wheelchair so I could see him sitting upright . Carefully I slid him off the bed , yet stepping back noticed he was wincing .', '          the wheelchair . I could see his shoulders quivering against the pain . When the shaking finally subsided , he raised his head and whispered , " I \'m so afraid . "', "I knelt down before the wheelchair and took his hands in mine , first the good one and then the bad . On his fingers were little tattoos -- a small round dot in the crevice between one thumb and forefinger , two on a pinkie , six in all . I knew           whom shared a similar mark on their own hands . For the last year or so I 'd been wanting to ask him if we could do the same , but was always too afraid . I rubbed the little marks on his fingers .", 'Aless looked toward me , though his eyes could not see .', "Alessandro 's fingers slid from my wrist to my palm and pressed of their own will .", '" No , but I want to . "', '" I want to , " I repeated , " I will , when I get back to the States . "', '" You have to go now , no ? " he said .', 'In my mind I could see it already waiting at the station . Could see it pulling away , like that tiny white boat out in the waves . I looked at Alessandro , a mere foot or two between us . I lunged forward and embraced him .', '" Thank you , " he said , " for coming . "', '" You have to go           . "', '" Why three , " he asked . " Three dots ?

Stumbled toward the train station .', 'By M. S. Nieson', '" Have you really never been to a ball before , Leila ? But , my child , how too weird -- " cried the Sheridan girls .

Leila , pressing close to Meg , looking over Meg \'s shoulder , felt that even the little quivering colored flags strung across the ceiling were talking . She quite forgot to be shy ; she forgot how in the middle of dressing she had sat down on the bed with one shoe off and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring up her cousins and say she could n\'t go after all . And the rush of longing she had had to be sitting on the veranda of their forsaken upcountry home , listening to the baby owls crying " More pork " in the           sweet that it was hard to bear alone . She clutched her fan , and gazing at the gleaming , golden floor , the azaleas , the lanterns , the stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and the band in a corner , she thought breathlessly ; " How heavenly ; how simply heavenly !

Find her partners ; she \'s under my wing , " said Meg , going up to one girl after another .', 'Leila had learned to dance at boarding school . Every Saturday afternoon the boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission hall where Miss Eccles ( of London ) held her " select " classes . But the difference between that dusty-smelling hall -- with calico texts on the walls , the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with rabbit \'s ears thumping the cold piano , Miss Eccles poking the girls \' feet with her long white wand -- and this was so tremendous that Leila was sure if her partner did n\'t come and she had to listen to that marvelous music and to watch the others sliding , gliding over the golden floor , she would die at least , or faint , or lift her arms and           the stars .', '" Quite a good floor , is n\'t it ?

Her partner gave a little gasping laugh . " Oh , I say , " he protested .', 'At that moment the music stopped , and they went to sit on two chairs against the wall . Leila blissfully watched the other couples passing and disappearing through the swing doors .', "Laura passed and gave her the faintest little wink ; it made Leila wonder for a moment whether she was quite grown up after all . Certainly her partner did not say very much . He coughed , tucked his handkerchief away , pulled down his           But it did n't matter . Almost immediately the band started , and her second partner seemed to spring from the ceiling .", 'Her first ball !

Leila looked at his bald head , and she felt quite sorry for him .', '" Kind little lady , " said the fat man , and he pressed her a little closer .

No-o , " said the fat man , " long before that you \'ll be sitting up there on the stage , looking on , in your nice black velvet .

" And you \'ll smile away           to your daughter , and tell the elderly lady next to you how some dreadful man tried to kiss her at the club ball .

She would have to dance , out of politeness , until she could find Meg . Very stiffly she walked into the middle ; very haughtily she put her hand on his sleeve .

Born in the Druid Heights section of Baltimore , to stalwart parents who loved each other and worked multiple jobs so that he could go to Towson , Geoff had become the first college attendee in a family up from the Alabama cotton patch . Perm Law School followed fast . Chicago Business School . A stint in the Coast Guard . A pair of defective marriages . A lengthy bout with John Barleycorn , a diagnosis of early-onset diabetes , his children \'s disapproval of a much younger , white third wife , a union that was n\'t working out but maybe had a chance if he could just get the two of them set up in the right circumstances           . Geoff \'s work as a high-priced restructuring litigator was in Newark , forty miles away . ( A car and a driver were part of his deal . ) His wife , Hollister ( whom I \'d met only once ) , was clearly a ball buster and would be down the road in a heartbeat , if only due to the difference in their ages - fifty-five versus twenty-eight . Geoff needed , I felt , to do some serious tea-leaf reading and brow-furrowing and possibly take a stab at meditation and marriage counselling before he lashed himself to a $3.1-million , gaudy-as-hell , high-Victorian manor house , needing roof and pricey bathroom work , that was once owned by a whiskey baron and former New Jersey governor but where Geoff would spend most of his evenings alone , and where the neighbors would take fourteen years to ask him for cocktails , and then only do it once . In other words , he \'d turn suicidal there . ( Of course , I \'d have made my ninety thousand , but what larger good would \'ve           asked me to make the unwelcome call to the sellers \' lawyer . I made the call . I explained . The situation engendered a bit of abuse and minor epithet-swapping . Geoff swallowed hard on half the up-front money . And he and I sang down the day - a cool March sun-streamer with no humidity - by driving over to New Hope , having shad with shad roe and a good New Zealand Gewrztraminer ( he paid ) , and telling each other the rest of the stories of our lives .

But there 's no way . Complicated , runic , fee-simple restrictive covenants that the boro holds ( unique to New Jersey ) require every postage-stamp householder to agree to sell before the whole acreage can be transferred . Plus , many chalet owners are among Sea-Brite 's oldest year-rounders , who came as children ( before summers at the shore became a nightmare ) , never forgot           own a chalet ( or six ) and start making their retirement nut off another generations renters - off the very people they 'd once been themselves .

The house actually broadcasts a bland , styleless domiciliary arrogance , which says that this building has no front either because no one \'s welcome or else because everything faces the sea , that \'s the front , and since it \'s not your house why re you interested anyway ?

Surprisingly enough , big domestic disruptions followed . The kids chose sides . Several loyal employees actually quit in disgust when " things " came out in the open . Welding damn near ceased . Clare and Estelle were entirely civil ( " She was the easy part " ) . A sad divorce ensued . A marriage to the younger Bitsy , Bootsy , Betsy quickly followed - a life commenced that did n\'t feel right from the instant they got to Aruba . One turbulent year passed . The young wife grew restive . ( " Just like the goddam Eagles song , " Clare said . ) She cut off all her hair , threw her nice new clothes away , decided to go back to school , figured out she wanted to become an archeologist and study Mesoamerican something or other . Somehow she discovered that she was brilliant , got herself admitted           with the intention of morphing her and Clare \'s odd union into something rare , free-floating , and completely modern .', 'Enter , then , Sea-Brite , where Estelle vacationed as a child and always adored it . Nothing now was too good for her . Plus , in Clare \'s estimation ,           of them could die before the world fucked it up . I drove him past twenty houses two weeks ago . Some seemed " interesting and possible . " Most did n\'t . No. 61 , in fact , was the only one that truly caught his fancy , since the inside was already fitted out with a nursing home s worth of shining disabled apparatus , including ( despite all the levels ) a mahogany side-stair elevator for when the dark days of disambulation drew near . Clare told me that if he liked it he \'d buy it as is and give it to Estelle - who \'s currently holding her own , with few symptoms - as a one-year re-wedding present . It makes a pretty story .', 'Down Surf Road ( there are only six similar houses ) , a bearded young man in yellow rubber coveralls is scrubbing down the sides of a white fibre glass fishing boat on a trailer , using an extended hose brush .

From back up the road I hear the screech of an electric sabre saw whanging through           satisfying bops of hammers pounding nails in fest succession . These are my Hondurans . The cold seaside air here has both a fishy and a piney sniff to it . None of this , despite the steely , unpredictable , weather-prone November sky , makes for one bit of bad feeling in me . As I look up to see a squad of pigeons wheeling above and , far beyond , a jet contrail high , high , high , heading out to sea and Europe , I feel well placed here at my post , doing the thing I apparently do best , staying grounded , my duties conferring a pleasant , self-actualizing invisibility - the self as anthropologically perfect instrument , like the athlete who is said , if briefly , to " feel it " and become sleekly the task at hand .', '         ', '" Boy , oh , boy , " Clare says , and shakes his head in dismay over modernity .

It startles me , and immediately makes me stare at its apparent point of origin , the seat           visible . It 's the ex-marine in Clare that makes such spontaneous emissions completely natural , completely unremarkable ( by him ) , while letting anyone else know how intransigent a man he is and would be - in a love affair , in a business deal , in a divorce , in a war .

Clare , after all , has given me a giant earful . ( No doubt he does it to everyone . ) Now he \'s just leery about making an awkward , unwanted " connection " with me . But ditto . I only want his money , for him to have a house , and for us both to feel good about it .', '" Absolutely . "', '" I took a walk around here while I was waiting , " Clare is saying as he goes , but in a softer , more intimate voice , as if he did n\'t want the wrong people hearing this . I \'m following , my listing materials smushed in my windbreaker pocket . The Doolittles \' house is , I see , in need of upkeep . The side basement door is weathered and grayed , the veneer cracking at the bottom . A scimitar of glass has dropped out of a daylight basement window and shattered on the concrete footing . Something above us is whapping with a metal noise in the area of the soffits - a loose TV cable or a gutter strap is my guess - though when I look up I ca n\'t see anything . The house could definitely do with a new owner and some knowledgeable attention . The Doolittles , who are plastic surgeons , have been spending their discretionary           it .', '" O.K. , look at this down here , " Clare says , almost whispering , bending , hands on knees , to designate by his notice where he means me to look " See that ? " he says gravely .', '" See that ? " Clare says , breathing out a captured breath . He gets down on his knees beside me like a scientist and brings his face down to the curved concrete pillar , putting his index finger to the hard surface .', '" These piers are poured far away from here , Frank , " Clare says , conspiratorially . " Sometimes Canada . Sometimes upstate New York The Binghamton area , " He is employing his index finger to scratch at some transparent sealant that \'s been painted on the pier \'s exterior but looks just like the regular surface of concrete . " If you pour your forms too early in the spring , or if you pour them when the humidity \'s extremely high ,           over at me - we \'re very close here - and smiles a closed-mouth gotcha smile .', '" They crack . They crack right away , " Clare says darkly . I see that he has a pale sliver of a scar right along the border of his Brillo-pad hairline . A vicious war wound , possibly , or something discretionary from his second marriage . " And if your manufacturer is not too scrupulous he does n\'t notice . And if he \'s unscrupulous he notices and has the silicone sealer painted on and sells it to you anyway . And if your home builder or your general contractor is n\'t paying attention , or if he \'s been paid not to pay attention , or if his foreman happens to be Italian , then these piers get installed without anybody saying anything .

But because it \'s on the ocean the salt and the moisture work on it . And then , suddenly - though it is n\'t sudden , of course - Hurricane Frank blows up , a high tide comes in , the force of the water turns savage . And - boom - Bob \'s your uncle . " Clare turns his head to me , where we \'re crouched like spelunkers behind the musty , quicklime-smelling Doolittle house , which is built , I see , on much worse than shifting sand . It \'s built on shitty pilings . " These pilings , Frank . I mean ... " Clare sniffs a sniff of distaste and homeowner pity , while pressing his thin lips together . " I can see cracks , and this is just four to five inches showing . These people have real problems , unless you can find a sucker who \'ll buy it sight unseen , or get an inspector who needs a seeing-eye dog . "', '" It \'s a problem , O.K. , " I say . I \'m staring at the innocent-looking little curve of pier surface without , frankly , seeing anything amiss . The thought that Clare is full of shit , or that this is nothing more than a softening-up ploy for a lowball offer , naturally occurs to me , as does the idea that since I ca n\'t see the crack I do n\'t have to bear the responsibility that attaches to it . A few stalwart ants , I notice , are scuttering around the lime-dusty foundation , no doubt taking in the air before the long subterranean winter \'s commencement .', '" What can you do about a problem like that , Clare ? "           , stuffing the listing sheet deeper into my pocket , since it clearly wo n\'t be needed . I experienced a brief moment of panic when Clare revealed the cracked pier , as if this were my house and it was I who was in deep shit . Only now , a little airy-headed from standing up fast , I register pure exhilaration and a thrumming sense of good fortune and well-being that this is not my house , that my man was a board-certified U.Va. architect , not some fly-by-night shade-tree spec builder with a clipboard fat with plan-book blueprints , who was in cahoots with the cement trade , the Teamsters , the building inspectors , and City Hall . In other words , a typical New Jersey small businessman . I \'m fine . " These words - in a murmur - somehow escape my lips . " I \'m just fine .

" The titanium seeds in my prostate are obviously not as close to dormancy as my Mayo urologist , Dr. Psimos - he of the " I \'d Rather Be in Sturgis " T-shirt - irresponsibly predicted .

In the middle distance , a boatful of day fishermen is anchored , their short poles abristle off both sides . The small breeze seems to blow straight through my ears and brings a shiver that makes me understand that for late November I \'m dressed too lightly . Of course , I believed I \'d be inside by now .

" Clare says . He           . We are the invisibles - like their parents .', '" Vertigo , " Clare says again , and gives his large , overly helical ear a good stern grinding with the heel of his hand . He clearly likes being up here on the dune , as anyone would . It \'s approximately the view one would get from a " reimagined " floor three of the big-but-compromised Doolittle house behind us . Maybe his mind \'ll change now . Maybe cracked piers are n\'t so vexatious after all . Things change with new perspective .', '" Yeah , I count , " a blond boy answers . " I absolutely count .

" You sure could n\'t make such a worry a contingency in a buy-sell agreement :           property as worthless as tits on a rain barrel . " In realty terms , this kind of worry is way beside the point .', "Clare s problem , of course , is n't a philosophical problem . It just makes him feel better to think it is . His problem with his circumstances is itself circumstantial , the usual occasion for worry : he 's made some normal human mistakes , suffered some minor setbacks , taken some shots , and he just does n't want to luck up again           . It 's standard ; an all too usual form of buyer 's remorse - only Clare 's experiencing it prior to sale . If he would just take a plunge ( always the Realtor 's fondest wish for mankind ) , banish fear , let loose the reins , think that instead of having suffered error and loss he 's survived them and that today is the first day of his new life , then he 'd be fine and dandy . In other words , embrace in full the permanent period of life , live not as though he were going to die tomorrow but as though he might live .", 'Somewhere , as if out of the spheres , I hear what sounds very much like the " Marine Corps Hymn " played on an electric xylophone .

His snapped answer is aimed into an impossibly tiny ( and idiotic ) red Nokia exactly like the ones the prep-school girls have in their Tommy Hilfiger beach bags . " Right , " Clare snaps , putting his other hand to his ear like Rudy Vallee , lowering his chin in regimental attention . He steps off a few yards along the berm . Every single particle of his bearing announces , " O.K. , now , this is important . " " Yep , yep , yep .

Even the prep-school kids seem suddenly excellent , hopeful , and doing exactly what they should be . Two women speed-walkers in woollen long shorts and sweats go herky-jerky businesslike down the strand . I am frankly happy in this lost moment I wish that Clare could know it , too , since with just a glimpse , permitted by a kind but impersonal life force , many things ( if not all ) can briefly sit down in these proper , proportionate places , and I ( at least ) can hear myself breathing to myself , " It \'s enough . It \'s enough . It \'s enough . "', 'He punches off his little red Nokia and returns it to its holster without turning around . He is facing north now , up the shore toward Asbury , twenty miles off .

" " It was my wife , " he says , stepping back toward me . The lady power-walkers are receding into the distance           net post and are laughing . I hear one of their cell phones ringing , a gleeful rilling that says " Yes , yes , yes ! " " Estelle - well , you know her name .

The day fishermen \'s boat has moved farther south , down the beach . " When I \'m gone for very long , it \'s as if she thinks I \'m not coming back .

An overweight , gray pony-tailed gal was spread out on a bench reading a local women 's newspaper . I put the magazine down and left the store .", 'The following day . Clay and I set out for Smith - Wesson . We stopped at a diner where a man wore a tee shirt that said :', 'We walked down the hall to the shooting range . I held the pistol . I loaded it . I shot the gun . Clay advised me not to think about the target . Just get comfortable holding the gun . Always point it down-range . Never have your finger on the trigger until you are going to shoot . The intense effort to focus on nothing but shooting was singularly pleasurable . I signed up for the class on our way out .', 'Two weeks passed and it was the day to drive over to my eight-hour class . To quell my rising anxiety , I chose an old Edith Piaf CD for the trip over . e ne regrette rien . Maybe that raspy voice I listened to in my youth gave me courage .

You got that sonofabitch ! \' No . You are going to be vomiting . They do n\'t show you this on TV . YOU will not he joyful . Get yourself to a hospital and tell them to treat you for stress .

You see a guy leaving from a side door , carrying who knows what . He \'s leaving           . You can not pull a gun on him , no matter what he has taken . "', 'After that long Smith &; Wesson day , the shooting students knew a lot about the legalities and safety of handgun use : locked containers , trigger locks , guns well-hidden , firearms and alcohol do not mix . But except for a few basics , none of us learned how to shoot . Years ago I had spent many afternoons preparing for my driving test , and this was much           a permit , I was appalled at how easy it was to get a gun legally , and I still am .', '" Why do you need this type of permit ? " he would ask .', 'In a bit of a fog , I wandered into Town Hall , then realized it was the wrong place . So down the hill I went , to the Police Station . Gun permit forms were piled up in a big bin in the lobby . I picked one up and a kindly woman led me through the process of filling out the application . Then she helped me look up addresses for my two references . Jim had said the police just stash your references in your file . They dig them out only if you get yourself into trouble .', 'I was becoming apprehensive , waiting for my interview . When I handed in the application , the woman took a photograph of me , to be laminated onto the permit . She said , " You \'ll be hearing in about two weeks .

" Less than two weeks passed when my gun permit arrived in the mail .', 'The cop , drawing a map for us , said , " Good . Good . We need people like you , especially , you know , with all the New Yorkers coming around . I saw this great bumper sticker down at the Cape . If it \'s tourist season , why ca n\'t we shoot them ? "', 'Yesterday , driving over to Smith - Wesson with Clay , I called him my shooting buddy , then changed it to shooting teacher . " I \'m your shooting sensei , " he said with his Southern drawl . He sees shooting as a martial art with all the discipline , focus , and meditative activity such undertakings require . Later I looked up sensei .', 'We arrive at the range , register , show our gun permits , and buy ammunition . We heap all our stuff - his gun box , my backpack , his attach case , our big down jackets - on a plastic chair outside the Shop which sells Smith &; Wesson logoed mugs , key rings , clothes , and of course , guns . We suit up for shooting and go down to the nearly empty range . Clay is saying , " You \'ve got ta relax . It \'s not very hard to do well at this . Focus on each little step of getting the gun ready , gripping it , standing , and then when you \'ve done it all , just stand there and shoot . Do n\'t try too hard . " The gun I \'m           with a bull barrel and grips like a .45 . Clay calls it a paper punch , because it \'s a target shooting gun with which you make holes in paper . But it is a deadly weapon .', "The ammo comes in a small orange plastic box with five shells per row . You slide the box 's cover back , pop the row of shells onto the ledge of your cubby , load them into the magazine . Find a good stance . Then ,           magazine into the grip . Slide the upper button down to release the slide , and put your right hand around the grip , never putting your index finger on the trigger , that 's basic . Put your left hand around your right hand , covering it . Both thumbs should hang there together , parallel , not doing anything . You have this good firm grip , gripping harder with your left hand . Loosen up your body , wiggle it , shake out the tension . It is important for all these steps to feel natural . Meanwhile , you 're excited and nervous . You 're about to shoot .", 'While I am shooting , empty shells fly all over the place , hitting the shield over my glasses , bouncing off the tip of my cap , hitting me on the head . The nitroglycerin smell released into the air goes to my head . The shooting is not exactly hypnotic , but it is very satisfying .', "Now that I have my gun license , now that I have spent my long day at Smith &; Wesson , now that I have been able to talk about my shooting to men on the right and wrong sides of the law , now that I 've told friends and family about all this and heard their various reactions , now that I have had the sensation of shooting a pistol , now that I have joked about using my government issued gun permit at the airport - what now ? Am I really going to learn how to shoot ? Would I pack a pistol and go hiking in the woods ? Am I going to own a gun ?", 'By Karen Chase', 'She was in town , from Connecticut , for a few more days . She had been with him when he died . He \'d left me some money . I was to take one of his cats , too , she said , he said you \'d know which one . Could I come over to the house ? Did I know where it was ? She gave me the address , and I agreed to drop by later in the day . She said , " I do n\'t know what to do with the other cats ;           ; we had had a stupid quarrel over it once , but that had gotten straightened out . Still , I did n\'t bother going over there , the afternoon passed and I had dinner and watched something on HBO and by that time it seemed awful late . I did n\'t need a cat to take care of , anyway .', "For the two years we were friends I did everything that Brewster needed done , so much so that I got into the habit of knocking on his door when I got home from work in case there was some errand or muscle work he needed , so I could get it done before I settled in to watch the news and have dinner , so that I would n't be interrupted ; it was a practical matter . I would           stairs at the apartments , past mine on the second level , up to his on the third , knock and wait until he came to the door , say Hi , as if I were checking on him .", 'One month I took him to the eyeglasses place six times on lunch hours and hours           of glasses through which he could see . I never knew , still do n\'t know , whether the glasses were good and he was just crazy or whether the optometrists and opticians were the most incompetent fools God ever made . It was funny , watching them try to deal with him , condescending but forgiving him everything because he was old , him playing that for all it was worth . We \'d laugh afterward , but each time he would say , " I really ca n\'t see worth a damn , " no matter how many times they remade the glasses . " They just think I \'m a crazy old duck , " he would say .', "I still live in the apartment complex . He had been here for years - I never was clear on how many - when I moved in two years ago . I do n't want to go to his place . I do n't want to see it . When he was evicted from the apartments , he asked me to move in with him , to split the house he was moving to . I had sort of agreed ; at least we had talked about getting a place at one time , so he had reason to expect it , but when it really came up , I could n't get over the idea of moving in with a seventy-year-old man . He was way past caring about how strange such a roommate arrangement might seem . I was afraid of getting still more tangled up than I already was , of his growing dependency , of making my temporary abandonment of social life with people of my own age and station into           might not have meant that , but at the time the prospect felt like being pulled under water I had been just sort of pleasantly floating in , expecting sometime sooner or later to return to land . So I guess I was n't much of a friend to him , when it came down to it , or at least had misrepresented the friend I was .", "They had no reason to throw him out , but they said it was the cats . Brewster had nine cats , and two of them lived in the stove , an ordinary sort of eccentricity , as common as cornflakes , the kind of thing nobody gives a moment 's thought until for some other reason the light of the community shines on you and suddenly there 's a mob of good upstanding citizens all jabbering fiercely to each other           the cats were pretty good about it ; they would do their business outside under the shrubbery or on the tiny lawn around the apartments . Every night at ten o'clock , the old man 's door would swing open ten inches or so and the cats , or most of them , would step out single file - a big old Siamese , followed by a gray , two black ones , a fluffy calico , another that looked red , others . They 'd step along the walk and down the concrete stairway like ducks , and then scatter , and if they did n't all come back smartly at ten thirty , you would hear the old man whistling for the stragglers .", 'He was particularly sweet on the Siamese , whose name was Antibody , but he called it " A. B. , " or more often , " Abe . " It was about sixteen years old , and liked its comforts . The one I liked best was what they call a " snowshoe , " a cat that looked Siamese-y but with bright white paws and nose , like the " points " were reversed . This one , the one we argued about , Brewster called " Killer-T . " It was some kind of weird joke . He spent contented hours reading medical magazines at a branch library .           wander into the kitchen and jump onto the open door of the oven and walk into it , I stopped what we were doing - we were playing gin - and pointed and stuttered , " The cat , the cat , " but he just smiled and nodded and told me they lived in there , the twin black ones . All the cats , except for the one he called Red , had names out of the P.D.R. - the Physicians \' Desk Reference , which I soon discovered was probably Brewster \'s favorite book - and were christened after disease fighters , cells , and medicines : Leukocyte and Lymphocat , Amoxicillin and Streptomycin , and so on . The old man was a hypochondriac as well as a cat lover , and although it was an ironic hypochondria , he was n\'t joking . He did n\'t like doctors much , but when I took him to see them , he repeated what they said as if it were the revealed word of God . His refrigerator was crowded with carrots and brussels sprouts and broccoli           , glucosamine and other pills , as well as jars of olive oil , which looked like green lard .', 'I had taken to letting Snowshoe into my apartment , but it was when she started spending the night at my place that Brewster got upset and threatened getting me evicted . I told him that " Killer " was a stupid name for a cat that was as sweet and lamblike as it could be . He made fun of me for saying " lamblike " and said I did n\'t know what I was talking about . He said he was going to call the damn police on me if I ever did it again . Astonished , I told him the cat never wanted to leave , and I           if it did n\'t want to go . He said just remember what he \'d told me . I \'d be looking for a new apartment in the time it took to say " Jack Robinson . " " Jack Robinson , " I said . We were behaving like children .', 'By late August , Brewster and I had sort of patched things up - I gave in , is how that went . I liked playing cards , especially when my only likely alternative was an evening flipping through my forty-eight channels on the remote control and then going to bed tired but not sleepy .', "For Brewster , the old woman he had sometimes spent time with , a sarcastic British           , had died in the spring , so he was as alone as I was . After she died , he had broken into her apartment - the lock was n't much - and taken a weird collection of stuff . He had photographs of her and him , a square jar full of sand , a slab of polished green and white malachite stone , and her hair dryer , a big old one with the bonnet in a round carrier , all on the shelves in his living room with books and magazines and a Civil War pistol that did n't shoot .", "We were three floors up . We stepped out onto the walkway and looked down into           got downstairs we found the woman 's orange striped cat in the pool . She said that old Abe and a couple of the others had chased it in there and drowned it , that it was terrified of the water . There was blood in the pool , too , a stain holding together , apparently from the head or ear . I got the skimmer and pushed it in under the cat and lifted him out , swung him over onto the stone . When I looked around , Brewster stood behind me with his arms dull at his sides , his rugged hands quivering at the cuffs of his gray shirt . He was looking over my shoulder at the dead cat , inconsolable .", 'It just got worse . A few days later , the Siamese , old Abe , disappeared , so I took off work and we spent all day and most of the night out looking . I was afraid of finding Abe dead on the road that ran in front of the apartments , though the cats did n\'t go out there much . A couple of days passed . Brewster was certain that Mrs. Eller had done it . He claimed that he had heard Abe calling - every Siamese has a distinctive voice , he said - from somewhere on the first floor . I laughed , and he looked at me . " It just seems . unlikely , " I said . A week after that , Brewster got a letter from the management company \'s lawyers which informed him that as he had violated the           , and as those animals had become a nuisance to the other tenants , etc. , etc. , etc . They gave him two weeks .', 'All through the last few days of the packing I wanted to say something - some new and better way of phrasing " no " - but after that one time he never asked me again about moving in with him .', 'I looked around the bare living area . The remaining cats were all there in the front room , and it occurred to me that they were there because they were afraid of being left behind . " Hey , Brewster , " I said , " I \'m thinking about just staying           , tried to get myself to look at him . " I \'ll think about it , but I \'ll probably just stay . "', '" I could n\'t take her , " I said .', '" I \'ll see her over at your place , " I said , and then a strange look flashed across his face for a second , and he abandoned the idea .', 'The house looks inside much like Brewster \'s apartment always looked - comfortable , squared away - although that may be Susan \'s doing . There \'s a long counter , a serving bar between the kitchen and dining room , and arrayed on top are five or six of the fabric-covered boxes that Brewster made , along with a camera and his antique pistol . " Do you want that ? " Susan asks when she notices me notice it . " Take anything you want , really . " " No , but thanks , " I say .', "I look around , searching for Abe , to make sure I did see him , just now , and there he is , asleep , indifferent . I wonder if he is sad , if he knows that Brewster is n't ever coming back .", '" Surely , " she says , " anything you want . I \'m shipping a few things north , but most of it is going to go to the trash or the Salvation Army , so do n\'t be shy . It feels like throwing away his whole life .

" She looks teary , then slips into her thoughts , a vacant look , and shakes her head slowly side to side .', '" Do n\'t think I can do that , " she says . " Legally , I mean . "', '" This \'d be the one , " I say . " He called it \' Killer . \' " Involuntarily I laugh and Susan looks at me and laughs , too . I raise my free hand to my face and try to force a straight expression , but laugh again .', "It feels weird being there by myself so I collect the gray box in one hand and Killer in the other hand and walk out and put them in my car , then come back inside for the bags of catfood . The other cats follow to the door , standing by as I carry away the two heavy bags . I put the bags in the trunk , then get in the car and sit for a while looking at his house . It 's quiet . I ca n't leave , it 's as if something 's holding me there , I 'm starting to           n't left first . I wish she 'd come back . I wish , I wish , I wish .", 'Shrug it off . They \'re just cats , stepping around on the upholstery , sniffing at things , sidling between the seats , settling , jumping , finding spots , all eyes . I feel better now , though , and glance back up at the house , at the yellow door . " Okay ? " I ask , loud . Alone . Turn the key the engine starts the car rocks a little , ease into gear down the drive and into the street .

For another , you should never tell a story unless you \'re sure how it \'s going to end . At least that \'s what my sixth-grade teacher , Ms. Shabbas , says . And I \'m not sure at all . I \'m not sure that I even know the beginning . I \'m not sure if I \'m a minor character or the heroine . Heck , I \'m not even sure I \'ll be around to tell the end of it . But I do n\'t think anyone else is going to tell this story . Wait ! What was that noise ? I listen for the footsteps on the stairs , footsteps much heavier than those an elderly man should make . But it \'s quiet , just the usual spooky nighttime creaking of this old house . I do n\'t hear anyone coming now . If I do n\'t survive , maybe they \'ll all realize I should have been taken seriously and then warn the world !           n\'t it ? But that is one of the things I do well , melodrama . At least that is what Ms. Shabbas says . Her name is Maureen Shabbas . But Ms. Showbiz is what we all call her , because her main motive for living seems to be torturing our class with old Broadway show tunes . She starts every day by singing a few bars of one and then making it the theme for the day . It is so disgustingly awful that we all sort of like it . Imagine someone who loves to imitate Yul Brynner in The King and I , a woman with an Afro , no less , getting up and singing " Shall We Dance ? " in front of a classroom of appalled adolescents . Ms. Showbiz . And she has the nerve to call me melodramatic ! But I guess I am . Maybe this whole thing is a product of my overactiveimagination . If that turns out to be so , all I can say is who would n\'t have an overactive imagination if they \'d heard the           Dad ? Dad had the best stories . They were ones his aunties told him when he was growing up on the Mohawk Reserve of Akwesasne on the Canadian side . One of my favorites was the one about the skeleton monster . He was just a human being at first , a lazy , greedy uncle who hung around the longhouse and let everyone else hunt for him . One day , alone in the lodge , waiting for the others to come home with food , Lazy Uncle burned his finger really badly in the fire and stuck it into his mouth to cool it . " Oooh , " he said as he sucked the cooked flesh , " this tastes good ! " ( Is n\'t that gross ? I love it . At least , I used to love it . ) It tasted so good , in fact , that he ate all the flesh off his finger . " Ah , " he said , " this is an easy way to get food , but I am still hungry . " So           had eaten all his fingers . " Oooh , " he said , " that was good , but I am still hungry . " So he cooked his toes and ate them . He cooked his feet and ate them . He cooked his legs and ate them . He cooked his right arm and then his left . He kept on until he had cooked his whole body and eaten it , and all that was left was a skeleton . When he moved , his bones rubbed together : **35;0;TOOLONG . " Ah , " he said in a voice that was now just a dry whisper . " That was good , but I am still hungry . I hope that my relatives come home soon . " And when his relatives came home , one by one , they found that the lodge was dark except for the glow of the cooking fire . They could see a shadowy shape beckoning to them from the other side of the fire . They could hear a sound like this : **35;37;TOOLONG . " Come in ,           have been waiting for you . " One by one all of his relatives came into the lodge . Skeleton Man caught them and ate them , all but one . She was his niece , and she had been playing in her favorite spot down by the river that flowed through the gorge . She was late coming home because she had seen a rabbit that had fallen into the river . She had rescued it from drowning and warmed it in her arms until it was able to run away . When the little girl came to the lodge , she was surprised at how quiet it was . She should have heard people talking and laughing , but she did n\'t hear anything . Something was wrong . Slowly , carefully , she approached the door of the lodge . A strange sound came from the shadows within : **35;74;TOOLONG . Then a dry voice called out to her . " My niece , " Skeleton Man whispered . " Come into the lodge . I have been waiting for you . " That voice made her           she asked . " They are here . They are here inside , " Skeleton Man whispered . " Come in and be with them . " " No , " the girl said , " I will not come inside . " " Ah , " Skeleton Man replied in his dry , thin voice , " that is all right . I will come out for you . " Then Lazy Uncle , the Skeleton Man , walked out of the lodge . His dry bones rubbed together as he walked toward the little girl : **35;111;TOOLONG . The girl began to run , not sure where to go . Skeleton Man would have caught her and eaten her if it had n\'t been for that rabbit she \'d rescued from the river . It appeared on the path before her . " I will help you because you saved me , " said the rabbit . " Follow me . " Then the rabbit helped the little girl outwit Skeleton Man . It even showed her how to bring everyone Skeleton Man had eaten back to life           all the time . Before they vanished . Disappeared . Gone , just like that . I was on TV when they disappeared .

" Colonel Trevor Griffin , operations officer and acting commander of the 996th Information Warfare Wing of the Air Force Air Intelligence Agency , asked as he hurried through the doors . His excitement was obvious as he waited at the verge of impatience exchanging security badges with the guard , facing a sensor for a biometric face-identification scan , and entering a security code into a keypad to open the outer door . Griffin was a sort of caricature , like a kid wearing his dad \'s military uniform -- short in stature , beanfaced , with slightly protruding ears and narrow , dancing blue eyes . But the broad shoulders , thick neck , and massive forearms under his overcoat only hinted at the soldier hidden behind those giddy eyes . " In the boss \'s office , sir , " the command \'s Chief Master Sergeant Harold Bayless responded as he met the colonel on the other side of the security barrier . " I came in early to get caught up on           buzzed you and the boss as soon as I found out . " " Let me know when the boss gets in , " Griffin said as he removed his Air Force blue overcoat and handed it to the chief master sergeant . " Make sure he has an office , a car , and billeting set up . " " Yes , sir , " Bayless said . Physically , the two men could not have been more different : Bayless was husky and tall , with lots of thick , dark hair and humorless , penetrating dark eyes . Despite their height difference , Bayless had trouble keeping up with the quick full bird -- Bayless finally had to let Griffin hurry off ahead of him , and he retreated to his own office to make all the appropriate notifications on behalf of this most unexpected distinguished visitor . Despite his fast pace , Griffin was n\'t even breathing hard as he hurried past the stunned noncommissioned officer in charge and into his office . There , sitting on the sofa in the little casual seating area ,           Griffin exclaimed . He stood at attention and saluted . " I \'m sorry , sir , but I did n\'t know you \'d be here so soon . I \'m Trevor Griffin . Good to meet you , sir . " Patrick McLanahan got to his feet , stood at attention , and returned the colonel \'s salute . Griffin came over to him and extended his hand , and Patrick shook it . " Good to meet you , too , Colonel Griffin , " Patrick McLanahan responded . " For Christ \'s sake , General , please , sit down , " Griffin said , a little confused at McLanahan \'s formal bearing . " It \'s a pleasure to have you here , sir . Can I get you anything ? Coffee ? " " Coffee is good , thank you . Black , " Patrick said . " Me , too -- commando style . " Griffin buzzed his clerk , and moments later the man came in with two mugs of coffee . Griffin introduced his NCOIC , then dismissed him . " I           for quite some time -- in fact , I was only just recently notified that you \'d be joining us , " Griffin said . He stood aside so Patrick could take the commander \'s seat , but Patrick reseated himself on the sofa , so Griffin , a little confused , took his armchair at the head of the table . " We \'re thrilled to have you take command of the unit . " " Thank you . " Griffin waited until Patrick took a sip of coffee , then said with a smile , " I \'m Trevor -- or \' Tagger \' to my friends , sir . " " Sure , " Patrick said . " I \'m Patrick . " Griffin nodded happily and took a sip of coffee , still acting as excited as a kid about to go through the turnstiles at Disneyland . " I guess it \'s been a while since I \'ve reported in to a new unit . I \'m a little nervous . " " And I \'m not used to two-star generals showing up without a           a two-star , Tagger . " " It was either a mistake , or a temporary budgetary/billeting/ allotment thing , or somebody \'s sending you a pretty strong message , Patrick , " Griffin said , " because the Air Force does n\'t take away a general \'s stars , like you \'re some young captain that just got a DUI . If they did , guys like MacArthur and LeMay would \'ve been buck sergeants in no time . General officers either get promoted or they retire , either voluntarily or involuntarily -- they do n\'t get demoted . " He could n\'t help but stare , bug-eyed , at the ribbons on Patrick \'s chest , especially the Air Force Cross -- the highest award given to an Air Force officer besides the Medal of Honor -- and the Silver Star . " But whoever \'s testing you or pushing on you , " he went on , dragging his attention back to his new commanding officer , " it \'s their loss and my gain . But we did n\'t expect you for another month at least           meet everyone , " Patrick said . " My son is with his aunt in Sacramento . " " And your wife ? " " I \'m a widower , Trevor . " Griffin \'s face fell . " Oh , shit ... I \'m sorry , sir , " he said sincerely . He averted his eyes apologetically , embarrassed that he had n\'t known this extremely important piece of information . " I received your personnel file , but I only glossed over it -- as I said , I did n\'t expect you for a few weeks . " This uncomfortable pause gave Patrick a chance to look Trevor Griffin over . His compact frame only served to accentuate his powerful physique -- he looked as if he had been power-lifting most of his life , and perhaps still did . Griffin \'s short-sleeved casual uniform had few accoutrements -- command jump wings under a senior weapons director \'s badge -- but Patrick saw his Class A uniform hanging on a coatrack behind the door , and it appeared as if Griffin had every ribbon and award           : Patrick noticed a Combat Infantry Badge and even a yellow-and-black ranger tab . " That \'s okay , Trevor , " Patrick said . " I guess I \'ve thrown a monkey wrench into your office by coming here early like this . I \'m sorry . " " We both have to stop saying \' sorry \' to each other . " Patrick smiled and nodded ... Continues ... \n A Series of Unfortunate Events : The Reptile Room Movie Tie-in Edition Chapter One The stretch of road that leads out of the city , past Hazy Harbor and into the town of Tedia , is perhaps the most unpleasant in the world . It is called Lousy Lane . Lousy Lane runs through fields that are a sickly gray color , in which a handful of scraggly trees produce apples so sour that one only has to look at them to feel ill . Lousy Lane traverses the Grim River , a body of water that is nine-tenths mud and that contains extremely unnerving fish , and it encircles a horseradish factory , so the entire area smells bitter and strong . I am sorry to tell you that this story begins with the Baudelaire orphans traveling along this most displeasing road , and that from this moment on , the story only gets worse . Of all the people in the world who have miserable lives-and , as I \'m sure you know , there are quite a few-the Baudelaire youngsters take the cake , a phrase which here means that more horrible things have happened to           an enormous fire that destroyed their home and killed both their loving parents , which is enough sadness to last anyone a lifetime , but in the case of these three children it was only the bad beginning . After the fire , the siblings were sent to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf , a terrible and greedy man . The Baudelaire parents had left behind an enormous fortune , which would go to the children when Violet came of age , and Count Olaf was so obsessed with getting his filthy hands on the money that he hatched a devious plan that gives me nightmares to this day . He was caught just in time , but he escaped and vowed to get ahold of the Baudelaire fortune sometime in the future . Violet , Klaus , and Sunny still had nightmares about Count Olaf \'s shiny , shiny eyes , and about his one scraggly eyebrow , and most of all about the tattoo of an eye he had on his ankle . It seemed like that eye was watching the Baudelaire orphans wherever they           have opened this book in the hope of finding out that the children lived happily ever after , you might as well shut it and read something else . Because Violet , Klaus , and Sunny , sitting in a small , cramped car and staring out the windows at Lousy Lane , were heading toward even more misery and woe . The Grim River and the horseradish factory were only the first of a sequence of tragic and unpleasant episodes that bring a frown to my face and a tear to my eye whenever I think about them . The driver of the car was Mr. Poe , a family friend who worked at a bank and always had a cough . He was in charge of overseeing the orphans \' affairs , so it was he who decided that the children would be placed in the care of a distant relative in the country after all the unpleasantness with Count Olaf . " I \'m sorry if you \'re uncomfortable , " Mr. Poe said , coughing into a white handkerchief , " but this new car of           n\'t even fit any of your suitcases . In a week or so I \'ll drive back here and bring them to you . " " Thank you , " said Violet , who at fourteen was the oldest of the Baudelaire children . Anyone who knew Violet well could see that her mind was not really on what Mr. Poe was saying , because her long hair was tied up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes . Violet was an inventor , and when she was thinking up inventions she liked to tie her hair up this way . It helped her think clearly about the various gears , wires , and ropes involved in most of her creations . " After living so long in the city , " Mr. Poe continued , " I think you will find the countryside to be a pleasant change . Oh , here is the turn . We \'re almost there . " " Good , " Klaus said quietly . Klaus , like many people on car rides , was very bored , and he was           loved to read , and at approximately twelve years of age had read more books than many people read in their whole lives . Sometimes he read well into the night , and in the morning could be found fast asleep , with a book in his hand and his glasses still on . " I think you \'ll like Dr. Montgomery , too , " Mr. Poe said . " He has traveled a great deal , so he has plenty of stories to tell . I \'ve heard his house is filled with things he \'s brought from all the places he \'s been . " " Bax ! " Sunny shrieked . Sunny , the youngest of the Baudelaire orphans , often talked like this , as infants tend to do . In fact , besides biting things with her four very sharp teeth , speaking in fragments was how Sunny spent most of her time . It was often difficult to tell what she meant to say . At this moment she probably meant something along the lines of " I \'m nervous about meeting a           How exactly is Dr. Montgomery related to us ? " Klaus asked . " Dr. Montgomery is-let me see-your late father \'s cousin \'s wife \'s brother . I think that \'s right . He \'s a scientist of some sort , and receives a great deal of money from the government . " As a banker , Mr. Poe was always interested in money . " What should we call him ? " Klaus asked . " You should call him Dr. Montgomery , " Mr. Poe replied , " unless he tells you to call him Montgomery . Both his first and last names are Montgomery , so it does n\'t really make much difference . " " His name is Montgomery Montgomery ? " Klaus said , smiling . " Yes , and I \'m sure he \'s very sensitive about that , so do n\'t ridicule him , " Mr. Poe said , coughing again into his handkerchief . " \' Ridicule \' means \' tease . \' " Klaus sighed . " I know what \' ridicule \' means , " he said . He           to make fun of someone \'s name . Occasionally , people thought that because the orphans were unforunate , they were also dim-witted . \n Chapter One The baby was the White Bead Baby . . . and her cradle is called natsi\'lid eta cote , the rainbow cut short . -- Sandoval , Hastin Tlo\'tsi hee The Twins The Ute horseman had seen their stern faces in all seasons . Whether bathed in blazing sunshine or veiled in a lace of softly falling snow , they were always the same . Massive . Silent . Awaiting the End of Days . On this day , Julius Santos had taken no notice of the towering sandstone monoliths . The rider was blissfully beguiled by those sweet things a spring morning brings . On the mossy stream bank , startled willows trembling with excitement at the arrival of an unexpected breeze . A flood of melted snow crystals rippling over an avenue strewn with slippery cobblestones . The crisp whisper of a magpie \'s wing , a startled darting of rainbow-dappled fishes . He was distracted by these pleasures . Any thought of trouble was far from him . But the giants were infinitely patient . Relentlessly , they pulled at the corner of his eye . Finally -- unable to resist -- Julius Santos           by a three-hundred-yard gap , the towering brothers seemed isolated in stony loneliness . But it was all a matter of how one looked at them . The Ute knew of a special place -- a unique , elevated point of view . From the Crag , it was possible to see the Twin War Gods as the ancients had seen them - standing near enough to exchange whispers . On horseback , the sacred overlook was barely an hour away . It would be necessary to cross GhostWolf Mesa , a knobby formation dotted with kiva and pit-house ruins . A dozen winters had passed since he hadventured near that silent , sinister place where old bones moldered under lichen-encrusted rubble . But there was no other way to approach the Crag . A narrow , precipitous causeway of crumbling sandstone connected the mesa rim to that upraised , wedge-shaped platform where the Old Ones had built a splendid temple to honor the Goddess of the Moon . During his last visit , Santos had stood on the very tip of the stone triangle , contemplating the gigantic sons           the Twins , something outlandish had happened . He had found himself leaning heavily on one leg . . . then the other -- as if a trillion tons of sandstone pitched and swayed under his feet . The tartled pilgrim had been overwhelmed by the illusion that he was on the deck of an enormous , storm-tossed ship . It seemed the illusory vessel was under full sail , toward some dark , alien harbor . But that had been years ago . He sat in the saddle , squinting at the distant mesa -- that dark , haunted space that must be crossed to approach the sacred platform . In the Ute \'s lurid imagination , the lumpy sandstone formation was a massive hand reaching up from Lower World -- with all fingers folded except one . That long , crooked digit pointed suggestively toward the Twins . And on this morning , it beckoned to the lone horseman . To ward off this enticement , Santos closed his eyes . In doing so , he encountered the inner darkness . And looked too deeply . The old           standing on the very tip of the soaring bow . Santos gazes over interlocked waves of space and time . A splendid illusion grips his mind . Just ahead -- separated by the merest slice of sky --the towering giants stand shoulder to shoulder , knee-deep in petrified talusdunes . They are anchored to the depths of a ghostly sea , waiting fortheir mother \'s pale face to appear between them . These are the slayers of monsters . Ready to take on sinew and muscle over bones of stone . And -- as in the Beginning of Days -- slay those unspeakable monstersthat feed on human flesh . Santos \'s peculiar fantasy was interrupted by a sudden stamping of the horse \'s hoof ; a heavy shudder rippled through the animal \'s frame . The rider took a deep breath , and turned his face away from the Twins . He assured himself that the vision was nothing to be concerned about . It was a mental deception -- a mystical mirage . The Ute turned his mount south . Toward home . This was a sensible decision .           . You are needed . Today you are needed . The long finger beckoned . Come . Come quickly . Santos pretended not to hear the call . But he turned his horse toward the mesa . Though he was not a traditional Ute , Julius Santos did accept those particular elements of his culture that he considered helpful . This included sage advice on maintaining mental balance . And so -- to the extent that he was able -- he did not think bad thoughts . Not that a healthy man could possibly submerge his soul in gloom on such a fine day as this . The breeze was crisp as a new dollar bill and refreshingly cool against his face , the morning sun a warm smile on his back . He had a good horse between his knees . Moreover , he was feeling uncommonly young for his years . The moderately vain fellow considered himself a fine figure of a man . And believing so , he was . Santos was long and lean ; his spine straight as a young aspen . He sat easily           seemed grafted to his mount . Having ascended to the crest of the mesa , his spirit was likewise lifted . This was not really a bad place . There were purple and yellow blossoms blooming in splashes of sunlight ; patches of melting snow hiding in the shadows of fragrant juniper . The rider directed his mount to the rim of the sandstone cliff . Snuffy was a steady beast who would step over a prairie rattler without so much as a shudder . She approached the edge of the precipice. \n CONSTELLATIONS Summer 1979 One summer many years ago , the Rubins and the Berkowitzes were out on the porch of the house they rented on the Jersey Shore in Allenhurst . It was a moonless night and stars were rising out from beyond the fold of the horizon . Two constellations kept on growing , almost like trees . Anthony Rubin watched the ocean . Each time another star popped over the horizon , he readjusted his idea of just what the shapes resembled . First he saw something that looked like a big panther . Then the shape turned into a box kite . Claudia Berkowitz lit a cigarette . She turned to Anthony \'s father and said , " Michael , you were a Boy Scout . Should n\'t you know the constellations ? " " He was too busy chasing Girl Scouts , " said Jess Rubin , Anthony \'s mother . Michael stood up and said , " Well , I can at least tell you what I learned from my great-uncle . He sold scrap metal . We used to visit him in Binghamton . " " Michael , you \'re drunk , "           and said , " Wait , I want to hear this . " " These are the Yiddish constellations , " Michael continued . " Somebody stop him , " said Claudia \'s husband , Douglas , but no one did . Anthony \'s father raised his hand . He pointed up to a bright zigzag of four stars . " Right there , " he said . " We can see the shiny belt of the Yenta , Miriam . " He pointed lower , to a cluster of stars that looked like a falling teapot . " And below Miriam , down on the horizon . That \'s Ira Nusbaum , the Swindler . Good thing that bandit \'s 40,000 light-years away . " He moved his hand across the sky and then picked out another random cluster . He said , " And here , to the north , we can see Maury , the Disappointment . This constellation was named after my third cousin , Maury Rosenthal . You \'ll always find it near the luminous Sophie Schatzberg , also known as the Great Kvetch .           . I think I \'m seeing Howie Grossman , the Great Schlemiel . " " That \'s very good , " Michael said . " Do we all know the myth of Howie ? " " Michael , enough , " said Jess . Anthony saw that his mother \'s eyes were incandescing with silent anger . He wondered whether she was offended . She \'d been raised Orthodox and had gone to a yeshiva as a girl . But she \'d stopped going after sixth grade . She had renounced all that yeshiva had tried to teach her , not to mention her parents \' orthodoxy . When asked , his mother always claimed to be an atheist , and so he could not fathom why the Yiddish constellations made her angry . " Poor Howie dropped the Torah during his own bar mitzvah , " Michael continued . " Such a schlemiel , " Claudia said , and raised her cigarette to her lips . " To keep him out of temple on High Holidays , God gave Howie his own place in the night sky . "           at Claudia and rose . She crossed the porch and descended the wooden stairs , down to the sand . Anthony \'s father followed after her . When he caught up with her they stood talking on the beach for a few seconds . Then Jess walked off and headed down the shoreline . Anthony knew where she was going . In recent weeks she \'d spent half of her time out on the jetty . She sat alone , watching the ocean . She sometimes sat so far out that she got drenched by the spray of waves . Anthony saw that his father was returning , a web of stars hanging directly above his head as he walked back . When he stepped onto the porch , he said , " She \'s fine . She \'s just going to the jetty . " He grabbed his drink and went inside to wait for her in their room . Later that night , Anthony and Jay Berkowitz were out wandering the Asbury Park boardwalk . It was just one beach away from Allenhurst , and the boys often           their closest down-the-shore friends , Bradley Kalish and Andy Sullivan . They all played Skee-Ball for a while , then walked the boards , acting like jerks , as they often did . Andy Sullivan was a studlong white-blond hair and blue eyes . Having him with them seemed to give the foursome license to talk to any pretty girls they saw . Not that they knew what to do when girls would actually respond . They were all thirteen , except Jay , who was eleven . At some point they returned to Allenhurst , went down to the beach , and midget-wrestled . They had seen tag-team midget-wrestling on television . Now they had given themselves names . Jay was Wizard Eyes . Bradley was Laughing Man . Anthony was Puckhead and Andy was Dr. Death . They \'d be announcers while they wrestled and always staged impossible situations . They would announce things such as , " Wizard Eyes , in a brilliant move , has ripped Dr. Death \'s arm off . " Andy would then have to wrestle with one arm behind his back .           She \'d just come off the nearest jetty and was walking back toward the house . He saw the stars in the sky above her . In some strange way his mother seemed like a constellation . He was about to run off after her , ask her why she got upset about the myth of Howie Grossman . Then Andy decked him . Jay jumped on top . He yelled , " And Puckhead is now crushed by a double dogpile ! " Bradley dove in and yelled , " But Laughing Man ... now mutilates Dr. Death and Wizard Eyes ! " Anthony squirmed out from the pileup , rolled , and looked again for his mother . He tried to find her in the darkness , but she was gone . During that summer they all became junior lifeguards . They got paid five dollars an hour . It was Andy \'s idea . His older brother , Shane , was the Allenhurst Beach lifeguard . Shane started out as a junior lifeguardat least , he claimed to have . Anthony could n\'t remember there ever having           past . As junior lifeguards they did n\'t do much lifeguarding . From time to time , Shane would take one of them up on watch . Mostly he took Anthony \'s sister , Dani , who was fifteen and just starting to fill out her bikini . She got more lifeguarding instruction from Shane than anyone , though she was n\'t an official junior lifeguard . She would n\'t take part in the main junior lifeguard dutycleaning the beach . It was their job to get up at seven every morning and sweep the beach for whatever garbage the tide had brought in the night before . They \'d get old sneakers , plastic bags , strange cans , occasionally a T-shirt . They also found lots of nonjunkpieces of coral , dead starfish , shells , and that amazing ocean phenomenon known as sea glass . They would find rounded , opaque glass in colors ranging from dark brown to green to lavender . Anthony always thought it miraculous that broken glass , pollution , could be transformed into these gems that lined the shore of Allenhurst Beach           tar balls . It seemed another amazing ocean phenomenon , but not something they really wanted to keep . The balls were sticky and gross , though they looked hard , almost like marbles , when they washed up in the tide line . All week long Anthony , Jay , Bradley , and Andy collected the balls with shovels . They gathered hundreds of balls each day , while never knowing what they were or where they came from . One morning in July , they woke to find the beach covered with syringes . It made the news hundreds of plastic little syringes without needles . Apparently , they \'d been illegally dumped at sea . The syringes were reported from Sandy Hook all the way to Manasquan . People were frightened of the syringes , which came in heavy for a week or so . Barely anyone would show up on the beach . Each day the junior lifeguards collected bagsful . At first they had to turn them over to the Environmental Police . Then it became a kind of mission . From seven to eight           life depended on it . Despite the fear most people had , he knew the empty syringes were quite harmless . He always trusted the magic of the ocean to make things safe . One night the four boys were playing Skee-Ball at the arcade on the Asbury Park boardwalk . To his own stupefaction and even mild discomfort , Anthony found that he could n\'t miss . He barely tried , it seemed , yet almost every ball he rolled up the ramp jumped gently and arced right into the small bull\'s-eye , worth fifty points . During one game he scored a rare , perfect four hundred . The machine spit out a very long strip of win tickets . He turned uneasily to Bradley , who was playing in the lane next to him . " Hey , check this out , " Anthony said . " A perfect game . " Bradley rolled his ball and got a thirty . He said , " No way , " and turned to Anthony . He eyed the win tickets , which hung all the way to the           this out . Rubin just scored a perfect game . " Anthony glanced around for Jay . The last he \'d looked , Jay was playing three lanes away . He said , " Where \'s Jay ? " " Beats me , " said Bradley . " Maybe the wizard boy went to do some math . " Andy said , " Jesus , check out all those tickets . " Anthony grabbed them and stuffed the tickets into his pocket . He turned to Bradley and said , " I \'ll be right back . " He started searching the arcade . He traversed three rows of Skee-Ball lanes and wove his way through all the rake-a-prize machines . He walked around the corner by the fun house , looked across the room toward the squirt-gun balloon clown game . He had the inexplicable sense that he \'d find something , and he did . He saw his father standing next to Claudia . She was leaning over the railing , her big butt staring Anthony in the face . His father \'s hand was resting on her           the mouth of a plastic clown . A red balloon was inflating out of the clown \'s head . One balloon popped . It was n\'t Claudia \'s . A little freckly-faced boy on the end had beaten her . Anthony sprinted out of the arcade before they turned . He found Jay wandering by the railing . He ran up wildly and said , " I saw them . " Jay said , " Me too . " " It was n\'t anything , " said Anthony . " They \'re in there playing that stupid clown game . " Jay nodded . Anthony could not tell whether Jay was denying or confirming the assessment . Jay said , " Let \'s go down to the beach before they see us . " They were n\'t Asbury Park junior lifeguards , but it was bright from all the boardwalk lights and easy to find syringes . They gathered them out of habit , dropping them into an empty popcorn box they pulled out of a trash can . When they hit Allenhurst Beach they kept on walking . They           far as the next town , Deal , then something happened . As if some magical wind were blowing , the ocean sky grew clear and dark , and filled with stars . " Holy shit , " Jay said . " They \'re even brighter than that night your father did the Yiddish constellations . " " There \'s Sophie , the Kvetch , " said Anthony , and pointed . Jay said , " That \'s actually part of Cepheus , the King . " " How do you know that ? " Anthony asked . " I bought a star chart . I \'ve been learning . " " You bought a star chart ? " Jay said , " Yeah . They have them on sale at the Shop Rite . My mother bought them for my brother and me . You should get one , or else you could steal Stuart \'s . He \'d never notice . " It turned out Stuart , who was eight , had already lost his star chart . The next day Anthony bought a star chart of his           the beach at night and learned whatever summer constellations they could find . Sometimes they could n\'t match a cluster to the chart , but Jay explained that there were many more stars than people would ever name . Jay said he \'d read long ago in Ranger Rick that there were more stars in the universe than grains of sand on the whole earth . When Anthony thought of deserts , this seemed impossible . Most nights in Allenhurst they were lucky if five constellations were visible . One night when Anthony got up to use the bathroom , he could see part of a constellation out the window . Framed by the windowpane , it looked just like a map . He moved closer , to see it all , and quickly realized it was Scorpio . Then he heard breathing from below . When he looked down he saw his father and his mother . Out on the porch his dad was kissing her neck and unbuttoning her baggy flannel shirt . He kept on watching , thinking maybe he was dreaming . It almost did n\'t           kneeled and let his chin rest on the windowsill . There was a glow from the other porch lights , and an ocean wind that carried their breaths and sighs up to the window . He saw his mother push his father \'s head back . He saw her slide the flannel shirt off her shoulders , then draw his face into her bosom . Her assertiveness amazed him . He kept wondering if somehow it were Claudia in disguise . But she was too tall and too agile , too lithe and sprightly in her movements to be Claudia . He saw his father kissing her breasts while his mother laughed and caressed his head . They both seemed happy , or else they were both drunk . The next morning , she seemed calmer than she had for all that summer . She did n\'t go out to the jetty . She read and listened to the radio on the porch . At noon she asked Anthony and Dani if they wanted to go for burgers at the Windmill , their favorite restaurant . They all piled into           was Dani who finally asked the question . They were eating on the top deck of the converted windmill , the lowest blade of the wooden rotor angling off to the right of Dani \'s head . She said , " So Mom , what \'s going on ? " Their mother looked up from her burger . " What do you mean ? " she asked . " She means you \'ve been kind of a nervous wreck all summer , " Anthony said . She put her burger down and said , " I had a scare . There was a chance that I had cancer of the cervix . " " And you found out it is n\'t anything ? " Anthony asked her . Their mother nodded . She said , " Last night . " " Everything \'s fine then ? " She said , " Everything is fine for the time being . " " You must have been so scared , " said Anthony . " It would have been okay to tell us , " Dani said . " I did n\'t           sip of her Diet Coke . " I always knew it was n\'t cancer . Still I was trying to get ready , just in case . " During the second week of August , the fecal coliform count got so high that all the beaches closed . Apparently , there was some sort of flesh-eating bacteria in the water . Shane Sullivan claimed that the bacteria came from raw sewage that had been dumped into the ocean . He also claimed that it caused human skin to molt and come off like a crab shell . The beaches stayed closed for six days . Anthony , Jay , Bradley , and Andy midget-wrestled and hung around the Asbury Park arcade . One rainy afternoon the four boys stood around the prize counter . They discussed prize options and what they planned to cash in all their win tickets for come Labor Day . Andy and Bradley both wanted the Muhammed Ali boxing gloves . Jay , who had barely any tickets , said he would probably go for the plastic back scratcher . After much deliberation , Anthony found           was a ceramic winged horse that was actually a coin bank . When he pointed the horse out , Jay said , " That \'s Pegasus , from mythology , just like the constellation . " They had seen Pegasus several times while star-watching that summer . Somehow this incidental correlation settled things . Anthony nodded and said , " Yeah , that \'s what I \'m going for . " That was also the week Bradley started them listening to Bruce Springsteen . He had just purchased a small boom box . He had four Bruce tapes and claimed that Bruce once dated his older sister . He started toting the boom box everywhere , playing all songs as loud as possible . One day while blasting the album Born To Run , Bradley suddenly stopped walking . He turned the volume down and looked at his friends dramatically . Then he said , " We are walking through Bruce \'s songs . " Jay and Anthony immediately got their parents to buy them Born To Run on cassette . They started listening to it religiously , and soon           Anthony found that Born To Run evoked a sadness , that certain songs were almost cinematic . Each time they listened to " Thunder Road , " all of the lyrics would unfold again inside him . He \'d always see a screen door slam . Then he would picture some wondrous girl named Mary , her dress waving as she danced across the floor of their house in Allenhurst . Toward the end of that week of the closed beaches , they even had one Bruce-related miracle . They met two Teaneck girls , Denise and Jackie . The girls approached while Bradley was blasting " Rosalita " on his boom box . They started singing along and saying things like , " Totally awesome song ! " Both went for Andy , of course , but he played soccer . Just a day after they met the girls , Andy left the shore in order to go to soccer camp in Maryland . This made things easier and soon they were all hanging out together on the boards . Denise and Jackie were best friends . Jackie was           and a gaze that always caused Anthony to wonder what she was thinking . Meanwhile Denise seemed the quintessential Jersey girl . She had thick black hair and plump breasts and would call out " Jinx ! " whenever she and another person spoke the same word at the same time . Then she would punch the person \'s arm until the person named five movie stars or beer brands or whatever Denise asked for . Likewise Anthony always had to say " safety " if he burped , otherwise Denise would say " slugs " and then start punching . She had three brothers , which explained her sort of tomboy roughhouse nature . She even liked to midget-wrestle . Both she and Jackie got their own names , the Big Babe and Psycho Kitty . One afternoon Anthony wound up alone with Jackie on the boardwalk . He had a crush on her by then . Jackie was eating cotton candy . They were both leaning against a railing , talking and watching small children ride the Asbury Park carousel . He got his guts up and placed           hand away , but also did not respond to his bold gesture . They continued chatting as Jackie ate her cotton candy , her captured hand still clasping the metal railing . Finally Jackie pulled her hand back . She held out the purple cotton candy and said , " Want some ? " He took a bite . She said , " You \'re Jewish , right ? " He nodded . " Then why the heck is your name Anthony ? I \'ve never met a Jew named Anthony in my life . " " I had this cousin , " he said . " Anthony Spignatelli . He was half Jewish , half Italian . He died two months before I was born . Until then my parents planned to name me Eric , or else Jill . " " How did he die ? " " It was a mystery . " " They have to know . " " They say they did n\'t . " He took her hand again . For a few seconds Jackie stared as if assessing the situation . Anthony           know you , " she said , and pulled her hand away . Allenhurst Beach reopened on a Sunday in mid-August . By then Anthony , Jay , and Bradley were getting bored with being junior lifeguards . They \'d make one garbage pass in the morning , then they would run off to find Denise and Jackie . The girls belonged to The Breakwater Club in Deal . They had a freshwater pool and a snack bar , unlike Allenhurst . They had a shuffleboard court , and Anthony loved shuffleboard . Because of Denise , they would always do laps in the swimming pool . Denise was big on self-improvement and was always pointing out the benefits of their various activities . Swimming laps helped both your muscle strength and cardiovascular capacity . She applied this logic to other things . For instance , midget-wrestling was good for learning how to defend yourself . Having to say " safety " after you burped taught you to think fast , or not burp . Playing shuffleboard honed your hand eye coordination . Weaving through people while jogging on the           of thinking to be contagious , though Jay did not . Once while star-watching , Anthony said , " It \'s teaching us to see better . " Jay said , " You think I really care how well I see ? " One afternoon they were all getting ice-cream cones and milkshakes . The nicest thing about The Breakwater was the charge account . Denise and Jackie charged everything to their parents . When Jackie \'s younger sister , Lizzy , got her cone , she took one lick and the ice cream fell . Anthony happened to be standing right beside her . Without thinking , he reached out with his left hand and caught the ice cream . Denise said , " Wow , you \'re like Mr. Lightningfast Reflex . " He placed the scoop back on Lizzy \'s cone . An hour later they went body-surfing in the ocean , having conveniently forgotten that one week before the water was filled with flesh-eating bacteria . Anthony tended to get cold fast . After five minutes he was shivering uncontrollably . He caught a wave and           they always put it . The wave \'s force slammed him against the sand , twisted him here and there and then pulled back . He rose and trudged out of the water . He could feel sand inside his bathing suit . So he walked over to the tidal pool by the jetty , and there he crouched in the shallow water to get the sand out . He saw a blue-claw crab move past his feet and tried to catch it . He saw the starfish that always magically appeared in the tidal pools . He felt a tap on his left shoulder , turned around , and there was Jackie . She said , " I followed you . " Anthony said , " I see that . " She stared in that sexy way that always made him want to know what she was thinking . So then he said it . He said , " Jackie , what are you thinking ? " She said , " Guess . " He said , " You want to look for crabs ? " Jackie said ,           , sending a crab scuttling in Anthony \'s direction . It disappeared and then Jackie was beside him . " I want to kiss you , " she said . " That was so cool when you saved my sister \'s ice cream . " " You want to kiss me because I saved an ice cream ? " She never answered . They started kissing as they stood in the tidal pool . He \'d never kissed anyone , though clearly Jackie had . Her touch was practiced , tender and delicate . She kept on pressing the tip of her tongue to his , then pulling back and saying , " You taste good . " They kissed in the tidal pool for about five minutes . He was just starting to press his tongue in far enough to touch her fillings . Then Denise , Bradley , and Jay ambushed them . They did n\'t see their three friends until they were running at them through the shallow water . " Break it up ! " Denise yelled . She jumped on Jackie . Soon they were           went for Denise . They pinned her down and made her name five Democratic presidents . That day they also invented a new move they called " the starfish . " To do the move required a tidal pool and abundant starfish . During a pin , the winner quickly grabbed a starfish and rammed it into the loser \'s face . Just before Labor Day weekend , Anthony \'s mother got arrested . It was a weekday . Anthony \'s father and Douglas Berkowitz were each at home that night in Livingston , which was an hour \'s drive from Allenhurst without traffic . Sometimes they stayed there on weekday nights instead of braving the Parkway after work . Both Jess and Claudia got tanked at a bar called Tides , which was in Belmar . On the way home , Jess was pulled over in Asbury . She was arrested for drunk driving and locked up in an Asbury Park jail cell . All four children were there when Claudia returned in a kind of frenzy . She said the officers acted like rough jerks and had left           Jess Rubin , she had walked back because she figured she \'d get pulled over if she drove . Michael arrived an hour later , after receiving his wife \'s phone call from the jail house . He explained the situation to his children . Then he and Claudia went out . Anthony did n\'t know what to feel . He kept on thinking that his mother was somehow part of a Bruce Springsteen song . She was behind bars in the Asbury Park jail house . She \'d had a cancer scare and would n\'t laugh at Yiddish constellations . Maybe it was n\'t as mythical as " Jungleland , " but it still seemed too confusing to be reality . He also knew that his mother would freak out when she got home . The children sat around that evening playing Scrabble . They watched The Sound of Music on TV . They played Monopoly , the beach wayusing sea glass in place of the plastic houses and hotels . They had lost most of the parts long ago , one night in Livingston when Dani got mad           . Three hours later , Anthony \'s father returned with Claudia . He said that bail would not be posted until the morning . Anthony asked if this meant his mom would spend the whole night in a jail cell . His father said , " Unfortunately , yes . " Claudia told them not to worry . Dani yelled , " Why ! It \'s your fault that she \'s in there ! " " It \'s no one \'s fault , " said their father , and made Dani apologize to Claudia . Still there was something completely off about the way Claudia was acting . Anthony sensed that she was secretly quite thrilled with his mother \'s fate . He could n\'t read his dad as easily , but he seemed calmer than he should have been . They left the room , sat in the kitchen , and drank vodka . Later that evening , Anthony saw them leaving . He was out on the porch with Jay . They had their star charts . It was the first starry sky they \'d had in weeks           right onto the sand below him . Before he thought very hard , he called out , " Going to see the Yiddish constellations ? " His father stopped and looked up . He said , " Anthony ? " He said , " Hi . I \'m out here watching stars with Jay . " " I \'m taking a little walk with Claudia , " said his father . " Just down the beach , to calm our nerves . Then we have to go get the other car . " He said , " Okay , " and understood for the first time that they were guilty . He watched them go and turned to Jay . He said , " Our parents are definitely screwing . " Jay said , " I know , " and shined a flashlight on his star chart . He turned it off and then looked up at the sky . " It took you this long to figure it all out ? " " My mom \'s in jail , " Anthony said . " It \'s like she \'s           , " She is locked up , " and shined his flashlight on the chart again . He shut the light off and then pointed . " Right there \'s Pegasus , " he said . " Do you still plan to get that bank ? " Anthony fell asleep that night before his father returned with Claudia . He tried to slough the whole thing off as a bad dream . At about six he heard a car pull up . He heard the front door opening and closing . Soon he could hear his parents \' voices . When he went down , they were sitting in the kitchen . His mother \'s elbows rested on the table and her forehead was pressed into her hands . She looked up and said , " Honey ? " Anthony stepped into the kitchen and said , " Hi . Are you okay ? " " Fine , " she said . " It was a very comfortable jail cell . " " We \'re talking , " said his father . He said , " I have to clean           . He woke up Jay and they went out to do their Allenhurst junior lifeguard beach sweep . That morning Bradley did n\'t show up . For a few minutes they waited by the lifeguard chair . Then Jay suggested they get to it before a garbage tide floated in . The found the usual plastic bags and beer cans . They stamped down seafoam in the places where it looked gross . They found a tennis ball in the tidal pool by the jetty . Anthony picked it up and noticed dozens of starfish lying placidly beneath the shallow water . He said , " Hey , look . They \'re making a constellation . " Jay said , " It \'s Miriam , the Kvetch . " " You mean Sophie . " He said , " Whatever . " Jay reached down into the water and grabbed a starfish . " Do n\'t even think it , " Anthony said . Jay said , " Think what ? " and was all over him in a second . They midget-wrestled . Jay kicked wildly . Anthony got           a starfish and pressed it to Jay \'s face . Jay yelled , " Okay ! I think I \'m lying on twenty starfish ! I might kill them ! " He pushed Jay \'s face under the water . For one strange instant he truly felt like drowning him . Somehow Jay managed to kick him in the groin . Jay squirmed away , brought his head up , and screamed , " You psycho ! " Anthony said , " What \'s your problem ? I just dunked you . " Jay coughed some water , then looked up and yelled , " You psycho with a totally psycho mother ! " " I \'ll fucking kill you ! " Anthony yelled , and lunged down at him . Jay rolled away in the shallow water . He grabbed his garbage bag , got up , and darted out of the tidal pool . He yelled , " You \'ll never fucking catch me , you psycho idiot ! " " I \'m sorry ! " Anthony yelled , suddenly realizing he was a psycho idiot . Jay           " He turned and ran down the beach with the green garbage bag . With his free hand he gave Anthony the finger . He held it up over his shoulder while he ran . Around nine , when Anthony got back , he learned his family would be leaving the Jersey Shore that afternoon . His father had already begun packing . He talked to Dani , who said Mom had a nervous breakdown while making pancakes . She was now sitting out on the jetty . Anthony went outside and found his father cleaning out the car . He said , " It \'s Labor Day . We ca n\'t stay here three more days ? " His father turned and said , " You know how your mother gets . " " But I ca n\'t go , " Anthony said . " I met ... a girlfriend . I also have n\'t cashed in my Skee-Ball win tickets . " " You have the day , " his father said . " We leave for Livingston at five . " Even though Jackie was n\'t really           In the course of just that morning , he jogged up to The Breakwater Club three times . He felt a panic but reminded himself of how he was improving his heart and lungs . After the third time he ran home and called Bradley , who said that Jackie must have gone yachting with her family . He yelled , " Since when does she have a yacht ! " Bradley said , " Hey , take it easy . I \'m just joking . " He packed his suitcase and made a final trip up to The Breakwater . He left a note with one of the club \'s cabana boys . The note explained that he unexpectedly had to leave , but that he hoped they would talk soon . He gave his phone number and home address in Livingston . He signed his name and at the bottom wrote : Please call ! In his last hour at the Jersey Shore , Anthony went alone to the Asbury Park boardwalk . He \'d counted out all of his win tickets and had tied them with rubber           same morning , he knew Jay might have lent him the forty-seven tickets he still needed . But by then Jay had disappeared with his mom and brother . They had all gone to see a drive-in movie . At the arcade , he told the man he had four hundred fifty-three tickets . He asked for the winged-horse bank , which cost five hundred . The man suggested he take a frog bank , which cost less . He said , " It \'s ugly . Ca n\'t you just give me the winged horse ? " The man said , " No . " " But I \'ve been saving for it all summer . " " We \'re not a Burger King , " the man said . " You ca n\'t always have it your way . " In the end , he wound up handing all his tickets to a long-haired boy who passed by on the boardwalk . He looked to be eight or nine and held a hockey stick , which was why Anthony had noticed him in the first place . He           Do you play Skee-Ball ? " The boy nodded . " Then take these , " Anthony said . " I do n\'t have time to cash them in . " The boy said , " How come you do n\'t just keep them for next summer ? " He said , " Just take them , " and handed him the bag . The boy said , " Thanks . " He said , " For forty-seven more tickets , you can get the winged-horse bank which is Pegasus , from mythology . He even has a constellation . You \'d need a star chart . " The boy just nodded , then Anthony took off . He could see Allenhurst Beach ahead of him . He smelled the tangy smell of ocean , which made him sad . He jogged with high steps , for no reason the way he sometimes did with Jay when they were imitating football . Two girls made fun of him as he passed , but he did n\'t care that he looked ridiculous . He knew that running this way improved his           coming back . \n I was eighteen or nineteen years old , working days at the Lovable Underwear Company , when I came to know the poet Ed Sanders . Ed , who twenty years later would win an American Book Award for his poetry , was then the ringleader of the notorious band The Fugs , and he also ran the Peace Eye bookstore , which at that time was on Avenue A. Ed had a degree in classical languages , and could read fluently in their own Greek and Latin those ancient poets that I could only understand through the gauze of translation . I had tried to teach myself Greek from the two volumes of A Reading Course in Homeric Greek that I had robbed from a divinity student a few years before , and I had taken Latin in high school ; but it was beyond me to truly delve the beauties and powers of the poetry of those tongues , as Ed could . He had even studied Egyptian hieroglyphics . We shared , he in his erudite way and I in my unlettered fashion , a love for those ancient fragments that were the wisps of the           the first and truest expression of all that since had been said . And we both had dirty minds , given as much to the gutter as to the gods . The Lower East Side was a different place back then . It was still a neighborhood . East Thirteenth Street was still known as the Street of Silence , a name I would bestow on another Mafia stronghold , Sullivan Street , in my novel Cut Numbers . The joints were still joints . We drank a lot in those joints . Ed was a great guy . He was about ten years older than I , and was the first real poet to whom I showed my poetry . " Hell , man , " he told me , " you \'re a fucking poet . " As I doubt he ever realized he was my first mentor , so I doubt he ever realized what a shove forward , what a turning point , this was for me . That poem , which bore the title " Still/Life , " and which I later invoked in my           follow . Still/Life A blunt shock to find your life in episodes on a Mochican vase ... &; the cool white tile ... emergency room , 3 AM \n Mr. Bones knew that Willy was n\'t long for this world . The cough had been inside him for over six months , and by now there was n\'t a chance in hell that he would ever get rid of it . Slowly and inexorably , without once taking a turn for the better , the thing had assumed a life of its own , advancing from a faint , phlegm-filled rattle in the lungs on February third to the wheezy sputum-jigs and gobby convulsions of high summer . All that was bad enough , but in the past two weeks a new tonality had crept into the bronchial musicsomething tight and flinty and percussiveand the attacks came so often now as to be almost constant . Every time one of them started , Mr. Bones half expected Willy \'s body to explode from the rockets of pressure bursting against his rib cage . He figured that blood would be the next step , and when that fatal moment finally occurred on Saturday afternoon , it was as if all the angels in heaven had opened their mouths and started to sing . Mr. Bones saw it happen with           road between Washington and Baltimore as Willy hawked up a few miserable clots of red matter into his handkerchief , and right then and there he knew that every ounce of hope was gone . The smell of death had settled upon Willy G. Christmas , and as surely as the sun was a lamp in the clouds that went off and on every day , the end was drawing near . What was a poor dog to do ? Mr. Bones had been with Willy since his earliest days as a pup , and by now it was next to impossible for him to imagine a world that did not have his master in it . Every thought , every memory , every particle of the earth and air was saturated with Willy \'s presence . Habits die hard , and no doubt there \'s some truth to the adage about old dogs and new tricks , but it was more than just love or devotion that caused Mr. Bones to dread what was coming . It was pure ontological terror . Subtract Willy from the world , and           exist . Such was the quandary Mr. Bones faced that August morning as he shuffled through the streets of Baltimore with his ailing master . A dog alone was no better than a dead dog , and once Willy breathed his last , he \'d have nothing to look forward to but his own imminent demise . Willy had been cautioning him about this for many days now , and Mr. Bones knew the drill by heart : how to avoid the dogcatchers and constables , the paddy wagons and unmarked cars , the hypocrites from the so-called humane societies . No matter how sweetly they talked to you , the word shelter meant trouble . It would begin with nets and tranquilizer guns , devolve into a nightmare of cages and fluorescent lights , and end with a lethal injection or a dose of poison gas . If Mr. Bones had belonged to some recognizable breed , he might have stood a chance in the daily beauty contests for prospective owners , but Willy \'s sidekick was a hodgepodge of genetic strainspart collie , part Labrador , part spaniel           were burrs protruding from his ragged coat , bad smells emanating from his mouth , and a perpetual bloodshot sadness lurking in his eyes . No one was going to want to rescue him . As the homeless bard was fond of putting it , the outcome was written in stone . Unless Mr. Bones found another master in one quick hurry , he was a pooch primed for oblivion . " And if the stun guns do n\'t get you , " Willy continued , clinging to a lamppost that foggy morning in Baltimore to prevent himself from falling , " there \'s a thousand other things that will . I \'m warning you , kemo sabe . You get yourself some new gig , or your days are numbered . Just look around this dreary burg . There \'s a Chinese restaurant on every block , and if you think mouths wo n\'t water when you come strolling by , then you do n\'t know squat about Oriental cuisine . They prize the taste of dog , friend . The chefs round up strays and slaughter them in           dogs a week . They might pass them off as ducks and pigs on the menu , but the in-crowd knows what \'s what , the gourmets are n\'t fooled for a second . Unless you want to wind up in a platter of moo goo gai pan , you \'ll think twice before you wag your tail in front of one of those Chink beaneries . Do you catch my drift , Mr. Bones ? Know thine enemyand then keep a wide berth . " Mr. Bones understood . He always understood what Willy said to him . This had been the case for as long as he could remember , and by now his grasp of Ingloosh was as good as any other immigrant who had spent seven years on American soil . It was his second language , of course , and quite different from the one his mother had taught him , but even though his pronunciation left something to be desired , he had thoroughly mastered the ins and outs of its syntax and , grammar . None of this should be seen as strange           . Most dogs acquire a good working knowledge of two-legged speech , but in Mr. Bones \'s case there was the advantage of being blessed with a master who did not treat him as an inferior . They had been boon companions from the start , and when you added in the fact that Mr. Bones was not just Willy \'s best friend but his only friend , and then further considered that Willy was a man in love with the sound of his own voice , a genuine , dyed-in-the-wool logomaniac who scarcely stopped talking from the instant he opened his eyes in the morning until he passed out drunk at night , it made perfect sense that Mr. Bones should have felt so at home in the native lingo . When all was said and done , the only surprise was that he had n\'t learned to talk better himself . It was n\'t for lack of earnest effort , but biology was against him , and what with the configuration of muzzle , teeth , and tongue that fate had saddled him with , the best he           and yowls , a mooning , muddled sort of discourse . He was painfully aware of how far from fluency these noises fell , but Willy always let him have his say , and in the end that was all that mattered . Mr. Bones was free to put in his two cents , and whenever he did so his master would give him his full attention , and to look at Willy \'s face as he watched his friend struggle to make like a member of the human tribe , you would have sworn that he was hanging on every word . That gloomy Sunday in Baltimore , however , Mr. Bones kept his mouth shut . They were down to their last days together , perhaps even their last hours , and this was no time to indulge in long speeches and loopy contortions , no time for the old shenanigans . Certain situations called for tact and discipline , and in their present dire straits it would be far better to hold his tongue and behave like a good , loyal dog . He let Willy snap           n\'t whine about not having eaten in the past thirty-six hours ; he did n\'t sniff the air for female scents ; he did n\'t stop to pee on every lamppost and fire hydrant . He simply ambled along beside Willy , following his master as they searched the empty avenues for 316 Calvert Street . Mr. Bones had nothing against Baltimore per se . It smelled no worse than any other city they \'d camped in over the years , but even though he understood the purpose of the trip , it grieved him to think that a man could choose to spend his last moments on earth in a place he \'d never been to before . A dog would never commit such a blunder . He would make his peace with the world and then see to it that he gave up the ghost on familiar ground . But Willy still had two things to accomplish before he died , and with characteristic stubbornness he \'d gotten it into his head that there was only one person who could help him . The name of that person           last known to be living in Baltimore , they had come to Baltimore to find her . All well and good , but unless Willy \'s plan did what it was supposed to do , Mr. Bones would be marooned in this city of crab cakes and marble steps , and what was he going to do then ? A phone call would have done the job in half a minute , but Willy had a philosophical aversion to using the telephone for important business . He would rather walk for days on end than pick up one of those contraptions and talk to someone he could n\'t see . So here they were two hundred miles later , wandering around the streets of Baltimore without a map , looking for an address that might or might not exist . Of the two things Willy still hoped to accomplish before he died , neither one took precedence over the other . Each was all-important to him , and since time had grown too short to think of tackling them separately , he had come up with what he referred to           both birds with one stone . The first has already been discussed in the previous paragraphs : to find new digs for his furry companion . The second was to wrap up his own affairs and make sure that his manuscripts were left in good hands . At that moment , his life \'s work was crammed into a rental locker at the Greyhound bus terminal on Fayette Street , two and a half blocks north of where he and Mr. Bones were standing . The key was in his pocket , and unless he found someone worthy enough to entrust with that key , every word he had ever written would be destroyed , disposed of as so much unclaimed baggage . In the twenty-three years since he \'d taken on the surname of Christmas , Willy had filled the pages of seventy-four notebooks with his writings . These included poems , stories , essays , diary entries , epigrams , autobiographical musings , and the first eighteen hundred lines of an epic-in-progress , Vagabond Days . The majority of these works had been composed at the kitchen table           her death four years ago he \'d been forced to write in the open air , often battling the elements in public parks and dusty alleyways as he struggled to get his thoughts down on paper . In his secret I heart of hearts , Willy had no delusions about himself . He knew that he was a troubled soul and not fit for this world , but he also knew that much good work was buried in those notebooks , and on that score at least he could hold his head high . Maybe if he had been more scrupulous about taking his medication , or maybe if his body had been a bit stronger , or maybe if he had n\'t been so fond of malts and spirits and the hubbub of bars , he might have done even more good work . That was perfectly possible , but it was too late to dwell on regrets and errors now . Willy had written the last sentence he would ever write , and there were no more than a few ticks left in the clock . The words           himself . If the words vanished , it would be as if he had never lived . That was where Bea Swanson entered the picture . Willy knew it was a stab in the dark , but if and when he managed to find her , he was convinced that she would move heaven and earth to help him . Once upon a time , back when the world was still young , Mrs. Swanson had been his high school English teacher , and if not for her it was doubtful that he ever would have found the courage to think of himself as a writer . He was still William Gurevitch in those days , a scrawny sixteen-year-old boy with a passion for books and beebop jazz , and she had taken him under her wing and lavished his early work with praise that was so excessive , so far out of proportion to its true merit , that he began to think of himself as the next great hope of American literature . Whether she was right or wrong to do so is not the question , for           and Mrs. Swanson had recognized his talent , she \'d seen the spark in his fledgling soul , and no one can ever amount to anything in this life without someone else to believe in him . That \'s a proven fact , and while the rest of the junior class at Midwood High saw Mrs. Swanson as a squat , fortyish woman with blubbery arms that bounced and wiggled whenever she wrote on the blackboard , Willy thought she was beautiful , an angel who had come down from heaven and taken on a human form . By the time school started again in the fall , however , Mrs. Swanson was gone . Her husband had been offered a new job in Baltimore , and since Mrs. Swanson was not only a teacher but a wife , what choice did she have but to leave Brooklyn and go where Mr. Swanson went ? It was a tough blow for Willy to absorb , but it could have been worse , for even though his mentor was far away , she did not forget him . Over the next           with her young friend , continuing to read and comment on the manuscripts he sent her , to remember his birthday with gifts of old Charlie Parker records , and to suggest little magazines where he could begin submitting his work . The gushing , rhapsodic letter of recommendation she wrote for him in his senior year helped clinch a full scholarship for Willy at Columbia . Mrs. Swanson was his muse , his protector , and good-luck charm all rolled into one , and at that point in Willy \'s life , the sky was definitely the limit . But then came the schizo flip-out of 1968 , the mad fandango of truth or consequences on a high-voltage tension wire . They shut him up in a hospital , and after six months of shock treatment and psychopharmacological therapy , he was never quite the same again . Willy had joined the ranks of the walking wounded , and even though he continued to churn out his poems and stories , to go on writing in both sickness and in health , he rarely got around to answering Mrs.           Willy was embarrassed to stay in touch with her . Perhaps he was distracted , pre-occupied with other business . Perhaps he had lost faith in the U.S. Postal Service and no longer trusted the mail carriers not to snoop inside the letters they delivered . One way or the other , his once voluminous exchanges with Mrs. Swanson dwindled to almost nothing . For a year or two , they consisted of the odd , desultory postcard , then the store-bought Christmas greeting , and then , by 1976 , they had stopped altogether . Since that time , not one syllable of communication had passed between them . Mr. Bones knew all this , and that was precisely what worried him . Seventeen years had gone by . Gerald Ford had been president back then , for Chrissakes , and he himself would not be whelped for another decade . Who was Willy trying to kid ? Think of all the things that can happen in that time . Think of the changes that can occur in seventeen hours or seventeen minuteslet alone in seventeen years . At           another address . The old girl would be pushing seventy by now , and if she was n\'t senile or living in a trailer park in Florida , there was a better than even chance that she was dead . Willy had admitted as much when they hit the streets of Baltimore that morning , but what the fuck , he \'d said , it was their one and only shot , and since life was a gamble anyway , why not go for broke ? Ah , Willy . He had told so many stories , had talked in so many different voices , had spoken out of so many sides of his mouth at once , that Mr. Bones had no idea what to believe anymore . What was true , what was false ? It was difficult to know when dealing with a character as complex and fanciful as Willy G. Christmas . Mr. Bones could vouch for the things he \'d seen with his own eyes , the events he \'d experienced in his own flesh , but he and Willy had been together for only           were more or less up for grabs . If Mr. Bones had n\'t spent his puppyhood living under the same roof with Willy \'s mother , the whole story would have been shrouded in darkness , but by listening to Mrs. Gurevitch and measuring her statements against her son \'s , Mr. Bones had managed to stitch together a reasonably coherent portrait of what Willy \'s world had looked like before he came into it . A thousand details were lacking . A thousand others were muddled in confusion , but Mr. Bones had a sense of the drift , a feeling for what its shape both was and was n\'t . It was n\'t rich , for example , and it was n\'t cheerful , and more often than not the air in the apartment had been tinged with sourness and desperation . Considering what the family had been through before it landed in America , it was probably a miracle that David Gurevitch and Ida Perlmutter managed to produce a son in the first place . Of the seven children born to Willy \'s grandparents in Warsaw and           two to survive the war . They alone did not have numbers tattooed on their forearms , they alone were granted the luck to escape . But that did n\'t mean they had an easy time of it , and . Mr. Bones had heard enough stories to make his fur tingle . There were the ten days they spent hiding in an attic crawl space in Warsaw . There was the monthlong walk from Paris to the Free Zone in the south , sleeping in haylofts and stealing eggs to stay alive . There was the refugee internment camp in Mende , the money spent on bribes for safe conducts , the four months of bureaucratic hell in Marseille as they waited for their Spanish transit visas . Then came the long coma of immobility in Lisbon , the stillborn son Ida delivered in 1944 , the two years of looking out at the Atlantic as the war dragged on and their money ebbed away . By the time Willy \'s parents arrived in Brooklyn in 1946 , it was n\'t a new life they were starting so much           . Willy \'s father , once a clever young lawyer in Poland , begged a job from a distant cousin and spent the next thirteen years riding the Seventh Avenue IRT to a button-manufacturing firm on West Twenty-eighth Street . For the first year , Willy \'s mother supplemented their income by giving piano lessons to young Jewish brats in the apartment , but that ended one morning in November of 1947 when Willy poked his little face out from between her legs and unexpectedly refused to stop breathing . He grew up American , a Brooklyn boy who played stickball in the streets , read Mad magazine under the covers at night , and listened to Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper . Neither one of his parents could fathom such things , but that was just as well as far as Willy was concerned , since his great goal in life at that stage was to convince himself that his mother and father were not his real parents . He found them alien , wholly embarrassing creatures , a pair of sore thumbs with their Polish accents and           about it he understood that his only hope of survival lay in resisting them at every turn . When his father dropped dead from a heart attack at forty-nine , Willy \'s sorrow was mitigated by a secret sense of relief . Already at twelve , just barely on the brink of adolescence , he had formulated his lifelong philosophy of embracing trouble wherever he could find it . The more wretched your life was , the closer you were to the truth , to the gritty nub of existence , and what could be more terrible than losing your old man six weeks after your twelfth birthday ? It marked you as a tragic figure , disqualified you from the rat race of vain hopes and sentimental illusions , bestowed on you an aura of legitimate suffering . But the fact was that Willy did n\'t suffer much . His father had always been a riddle to him , a man prone to weeklong silences and sudden outbursts of rage , and more than once he had slapped down Willy for the smallest , most trifling infraction . No           that bag of explosives . It did n\'t take any effort at all : Or so reckoned the good Herr Doktor Bones . Ignore his opinion it you will , but who else are you prepared to trust ? After listening to these stories for the past seven years , had he not earned the right to be called the world \'s leading authority on the subject ? That left Willy alone with his mother . She was hardly anyone \'s idea of a good time , but at least she kept her hands to herself and showed him considerable amounts of affection , enough warmth of heart to counterbalance the periods when she nagged him and harangued him and got on his nerves . By and large , Willy tried to be a good son . At those rare moments when he was able to stop thinking about himself , he even made a conscious effort to be nice to her . If they had their differences , they were less a result of personal animosity than of starkly opposing world views . From hard-won experience , Mrs. Gurevitch           and she lived her life accordingly , doing everything in her power to stay clear of harm \'s way . Willy also knew that the world was out to get him , but unlike his mother he had no qualms about fighting back . The difference was not that one was a pessimist and the other an optimist , it was that one \'s pessimism had led to an ethos of fear , and the other \'s pessimism had led to a noisy , fractious disdain for Everything-That-Was . One shrank , the other flailed . One toed the line , the other crossed it out . Much of the time they were at loggerheads , and because Willy found it so easy to shock his mother , he rarely wasted an opportunity to provoke an argument . If only she \'d had the wit to back off a little , he probably would n\'t have been so insistent about making his points . Her antagonism inspired him , pushed him into ever more extreme positions , and by the time he was ready to leave the house , and           in his chosen role : as malcontent , as rebel , as outlaw poet prowling the gutters of a ruined world . Lord knows how many drugs that boy ingested in the two and a half years he spent on Morningside Heights . Name an illegal substance , and Willy either smoked it or snorted it or shot it into his veins . It \'s one thing to walk around pretending you \'re the second coming of Franois Villon , but feed an unstable young man enough toxic confections to fill a dump site in the Jersey Meadowlands , and his body chemistry is bound to be altered . Sooner or later , Willy might have cracked up anyway , but who would argue that the psychedelic free-for-all of his student days did n\'t accelerate the process ? When his roommate walked in on him one afternoon in the middle of his junior year and found Willy buck naked on the floorchanting names from the Manhattan phone book and eating a bowl of his own excrementthe academic career of Mr. Bones \'s future master came to an abrupt and permanent           returned to his mother \'s apartment on Glenwood Avenue . It was n\'t the ideal place for him to live , perhaps , but where else could a burnout like poor Willy go ? For the first six months , not much good came of the arrangement . Other than Willy \'s switch from drugs to alcohol , things were essentially the same as they had been . The same tensions , the same conflicts , the same misunderstandings . Then , out of the blue , in late December 1969 , Willy had the vision that changed everything , the mystical encounter with blessedness that turned him inside out and set his life on an entirely different course . It was two-thirty in the morning . His mother had gone to bed several hours before , and Willy was parked on the living room sofa with a pack of Luckies and a bottle of bourbon , watching television out of the corner of one eye . Television was a new habit for him , a by-product of his recent stay in the hospital . He was n\'t particularly interested           having the hum and glow of the tube in the background and found comfort in the gray-blue shadows it cast on the walls . The Late Late Show was on just then ( something to do with gigantic grasshoppers devouring the citizens of Sacramento , California ) , but most of the airtime had been given over to chintzy exhortations on behalf of miracle breakthrough products : knives that never went dull , lightbulbs that never burned out , secret-formula lotions that removed the curse of baldness . Yak yak yak , Willy muttered to himself , it \'s the same old suds and blather . Just as he was about to stand up and turn off the television , however , a new commercial came on , and there was Santa Claus popping out of someone \'s fireplace in what looked like a suburban living room in Massapequa , Long Island . Given that Christmas was just around the corner , Willy had grown used to commercials that featured actors dressed up as Santa Claus . But this one was better than mosta roly-poly guy with rosy cheeks and           beginning of the spiel , fully expecting to hear something about rug shampoos or burglar alarms , when all of a sudden Santa uttered the words that would change his destiny . " William Gurevitch , " Santa said . " Yes , William Gurevitch of Brooklyn , New York , I \'m talking to you . " Willy had drunk only half a bottle that night , and it had been eight months since his last full-blown hallucination . Nobody was going to trick him into swallowing this garbage . He knew the difference between reality and make-believe , and if Santa Claus was talking to him from his mother \'s television set , that could only mean he was a lot drunker than he supposed . " Fuck you , mister , " Willy said , and without giving the matter another thought , he clicked off the machine . Unfortunately , he was n\'t able to leave things as they were . Because he was curious , or because he wanted to make sure he was n\'t having another breakdown , Willy decided it would be all           peek , a last little peek . It was n\'t going to hurt anyone , was it ? Better to learn the truth now than to walk around with that sack of Yuletide shit preying on his mind for the next forty years . And lo and behold , there he was again . There was Santa bloody Claus , wagging his finger at Willy and shaking his head with a sad , disappointed look in his eyes . When he opened his mouth and started to talk ( picking up precisely where he had left off ten seconds earlier ) , Willy did n\'t know whether he should burst out laughing or jump through the window . It was happening , folks . What could not happen was happening , and right then and there Willy knew that nothing in the world would ever look the same to him again . " That was n\'t nice , William , " Santa said . " I \'m here to help you , but we \'re never going to get anywhere if you do n\'t give me a chance to talk           question seemed to call for a response , but Willy hesitated . Listening to this clown was bad enough . Did he really want to make things worse by talking back to him ? " William ! " Santa said . His voice was stern and reproachful , and it contained the power of a personality that was not to be trifled with . If Willy was ever going to squirm out of this nightmare , his only hope would be to play along . " Yeah , boss , " he mumbled , " I read you loud and clear . " The fat man smiled . Then , very slowly , the camera moved in on him for a close-up . For the next several seconds Santa stood there stroking his beard , apparently lost in thought . " Do you know who I am ? " he finally said . " I know who you look like , " Willy said , " but that does n\'t mean I know who you are . At first I thought you were some asshole actor . Then I thought           I do n\'t have a clue . " " The thing I look like is the thing I am . " " Sure , pal , and I \'m Haile Selassie \'s brother-in-law . " " Santa Claus , William . A.k.a . Saint Nick . Father Christmas himself . The only force for good left in the world . " " Santa , huh ? And you would n\'t happen to spell that S-A-N-T-A , would you ? " " Yes , I would . That \'s exactly how I \'d spell it . " " That \'s what I figured . Now rearrange the letters a little bit , and what do you have ? S-A-T-A-N , that \'s what . You \'re the goddamn devil , grandpa , and the only place you exist is in my mind . " Notice how Willy struggled against the apparition , how determined he was to thwart its charms . He was n\'t some pea-brained psycho who let figments and specters push him around . He wanted no part of this one , and the disgust he felt , the           of the encounter , was precisely what convinced Mr. Bones that it was true , that Willy had experienced an authentic vision and was not making the story up . To hear him tell it , the situation was a scandal , an insult to his intelligence , and merely having to look at that bovine lump of clichs brought his blood to a boil . Let someone else make with the ho-ho stuff . Christmas was a fraud , a season for quick bucks and ringing cash registers , and as the symbol of that season , as the very essence of the whole consumerist shebang , Santa was the biggest fake of them all . But this Santa was no fake , and he was no devil in disguise . He was the true Father Christmas , the one and only Lord of the Elves and Spirits , and the message he \'d come to preach was one of goodness , generosity , and self-sacrifice . This unlikeliest of fictions , this contradiction of everything Willy stood for , this absurd display of hokum in the red jacket           Madison Avenue gloryhad sprung forth from the depths of Television Land to debunk the certitudes of Willy \'s skepticism and put his soul back together again . It was as simple as that . If anyone was a fraud , Santa said , it was Willy , and then he let him have it in no uncertain terms , lecturing the frightened and bewildered boy for the better part of an hour . He called him a sham , a poseur , and a no-talent hack . Then he upped the ante and called him a zero , a douche bag , a dunderhead , and little by little he broke down the wall of Willy \'s defenses and made him see the light . Willy was on the floor by then , weeping his eyes out as he begged for mercy and promised to mend his ways . Christmas was real , he learned , and there would be no truth or happiness for him until he began to embrace its spirit . That would be his mission in life from now on : to embody the message of           nothing from the world and give it only love in return . In other words , Willy decided to turn himself into a saint . ( Continues ... ) \n Chapter One I saw a lot of fires when I was a cop in Detroit . I was supposed to help secure the scene and then get the hell out of the way , but sometimes I \'d stick around and watch the firefighters doing their work . I saw some real battles , but when they were done , the building would always be standing . That was the thing that got to me . The windows would be blown out , and maybe there \'d be a big hole in the roof , but the building would still be there . Years later , I watched a Lake Superior storm taking down a boathouse . When the storm let up , there was nothing left but a concrete slab covered with sand . It was n\'t surprising . Anyone who lives up here knows that water is stronger than fire . Water wins that one going away . But at least water cleans up after itself . It does the job all the way . When water destroys , it makes everything look new . It can even be beautiful . Fire does n\'t do that .           only half destroyed . It is charred and brittle . It is obscene . There is nothing so ugly in all the world as what a fire leaves behind , covered in ashes and smoke and a smell you \'ll think about every day for the rest of your life . That \'s why I had to start rebuilding the cabin . Maybe I was fooling myself , but it was something I had to do . Even though the days were getting shorter . Even though the pine trees were bending in the cold October wind . No man in his right mind would have started rebuilding then . So of course I did . I had already taken away most of the old wood , those logs that would have lasted another three hundred years if they had n\'t burned . I had hauled them away along with the pipes burned black and the bed frames twisted by the heat . There was nothing now but the stone foundation , stripped of the wooden floor , and the chimney , the last thing my father had made with           the snow would come , and it would cover the black stains on the ground , and the chimney would stand alone in the cold silence like a grave marker . I was n\'t going to let that happen . The rebuilding did n\'t start well . The man who said he \'d be there on Monday with my white pine logs rolled up on Wednesday morning , acting like he had nothing to apologize for . He had one of those long flatbeds with a crane on it , with enough lifting power to set every last log down as gently as a teacup . But it took him all morning to clear the truck , and he damn near knocked over the chimney in the process . Then he stood around for a while , trying to tell me about his own cabin down in Traverse City . " The cabins I passed on the way in , " he finally said . " You built those ? " " My father did . " " Looks like you had a big one here , " he said           the clearing . " What happened ? Did it burn down ? " " It did . " " Hell of a thing , " he said . " You got ta be careful with those wood stoves . " " I ca n\'t argue with that . " " Looks like you learned the hard way . " I let a few seconds tick by . " It was n\'t a wood stove , " I finally said . " Somebody burned it down . " " You \'re shittin \' me . " " This gentleman and I , we had a little disagreement . " It took a moment for that one to sink in . " Are you shittin \' me , man ? You got ta be shittin \' me . " " You do n\'t have to believe it . " " I suppose you \'re gon na rebuild this all by yourself , too . " " I \'m gon na try . " " Seriously , where \'s all your help at ? " " If I need help , I \'ll           he said . " You \'re not thinking of starting this now , are you ? " " I \'d have to be crazy , you mean . " " Is what I \'m saying , yeah . Unless you \'re just shittin \' me some more . " " Well , I appreciate your concern , " I said . " And I appreciate you bringing up my logs . You were only two days late . Have a good trip back home . " He was still shaking his head as he drove away . I listened to the distant sound of his truck as he rumbled onto the main road and headed south . When he was gone , there was nothing left to hear but a steady wind coming off the lake . " Well , Pops , " I said to the wind , " let \'s see if I remember how to do this . " This was the cabin he had built in the summers of 1980 and 1981 . I helped him for a few weeks in that second year . I           officer in Detroit , and this was my last attempt to make peace with him . The days were hot . I remember that . And as I helped him peel and scribe the logs , it brought back yet another summer , back in 1968 , the first time I had ever been up here in Paradise , Michigan . I was only seventeen then , with one more year of school ahead of me before heading off to single-A ball in Sarasota . He wanted me to go to college , but I had my own ideas . Thirteen years later , he finished this cabin , his biggest and best . His masterpiece . Six months after that he was dead . The cabin may have burned to the ground , but at least we had those summers . Twenty years later , on a cold October day , I started all over again . I cut the sill logs first , the logs that would run along the bottom of each wall , then secured them to the foundation with j bolts . I cut a           just as he had taught me . When it rained , the water would collect in the groove and drip away instead of running down the foundation . Then I cut the grooves for the floor joists . I put rough plywood down for the time being-I \'d put the nice hardwood floorboards down when the outside was finished . That was the first day . When the light was gone , I went down to the Glasgow Inn for dinner . My friend Jackie owns the place . If you ever find yourself in Paradise , just go to the one blinking light in the center of town , then go north another hundred yards or so . It \'ll be there on the right . When you step into the place , you wo n\'t see a typical American bar-there are no mirrors to stare into while you drink , no smoky dark corners to nurse a bad mood in . The chairs are comfortable , there \'s a fire going in the hearth every night , regardless of the weather , and there \'s a man there           caddie . If you ask him the right way , Jackie will even risk his liquor license and give you a cold Canadian beer . I take that last part back . Those Canadian beers are just for me . I felt like hell the next morning . My hands were sore , my arms were sore , my legs were sore , and my back was sore . Aside from that I was fine . I had my coffee and looked up at the dark clouds . Rain was the last thing I needed , because today was the day I \'d start building the walls . I scribed each log the way my father had done . I did most of the heavy cutting with the chain saw , stopping every half hour to sharpen it . I used an ax to cut the notches , keeping both hands together as I swung it , like a baseball bat . That much he did n\'t have to teach me . You ca n\'t be accurate with your hands apart . Of course , cutting the scarf just right           liked to say , this is where you separated the men from the boys . The idea is to cut it so perfectly that one log will rest on top of the other with no daylight in between . If you do it right , you do n\'t need any chinking . If you do n\'t do it right , then God help you . You \'ve got no business building a cabin in the first place . The first log I tried cutting that morning , I did n\'t get right . The second log was worse . The third log you could have put in a carnival and charged people five dollars a head to come laugh at it . The wind picked up . It looked like rain was coming . I kept working . I was halfway through the fourth log when the hornets attacked me . The nest was hanging from one of the birch trees . They had already been smoked out the night of the fire , the nest partially caved in by the spray of the fire hoses . They were trying           had run out of time . Now half-crazed by the cold weather , most of them near the end of their natural lives , they saw me moving around below them , rattling around with my chain saw . They decided to go down fighting . I slapped two off the back of my neck , another off my arm . " Crazy fucking things ! Get away from me ! " The next one caught me right on the cheek and that was it for me . The day was already going bad enough . I had my extension ladder there , figuring I \'d need it eventually , so I braced it up against the birch tree and climbed up with my ax . I was just about to swing at the branch . I was going to take the whole thing down with one good whack , and then I was going to soak the nest with gasoline and set it on fire . Knowing me , I would have emptied the can , a full two gallons of gasoline , and then I would have thrown           All the leaves on the ground would have gone up at once and I \'d be running around with my pants on fire and both eyebrows singed right off my face . I stopped myself just in time . I took a deep breath and climbed back down the ladder . I dropped the ax . It was n\'t worth it . Watching the nest burn , sending the rest of those hornets to hell . They \'d all be dead in another week , anyway . It was a lesson I had taken most of my life to learn . Sometimes you have to let things go . The rain came . The dark clouds stayed in the sky . I went back to work . I had come back up here in 1987 . My marriage was over and I was off the police force , with a dead partner in the ground and a bullet in my chest . I came up here intending to sell off the land and the six cabins my father had built , but I did n\'t do it . Somehow the           cold and unforgiving , even in the heart of summer . There was a terrible beauty to the place , and I could be alone up here in a part of the world where being alone was the rule and not the exception . I moved into the first cabin , the cabin I had helped him build myself , back when I was seventeen years old . I stayed up here and lived day to day and never thought I \'d have to face my past again . That did n\'t work . It never does . Hours after I called it a day , I could still feel the buzz of the chain saw in my hands . There was a deep ache in my shoulder , right where they had taken the other two bullets out . " What was it this time ? " Jackie said . He slid a cold Canadian my way . He was talking about my face , of course . There was a nice little swollen knot under my eye . Whenever something goes wrong , I end up wearing it           . " How \'s the cabin going ? " " It \'s a little slow . " He nodded his head . He did n\'t say a word about how late it was in the season or how much of a fool I was . Jackie understood why I needed to do this . " You know who could help you , " he said . I knew . I took a long pull off the bottle and then set it back down on the bar . " I \'ve got to get some sleep , " I said . Then I left . I was just as sore the next morning , but somehow everything felt different . It was all coming back to me , the way you let the chain saw and the ax do the work , the way you work with the grain of the log instead of fighting against it . The logs started fitting together the way they were supposed to . I had the walls two logs high by lunchtime . Of course , that meant it was getting harder and harder           to start using the ramps soon , and eventually I \'d have to set up some kind of skyline . That would slow me down . Hell , maybe Jackie was right . There was one man who could really help me . But I \'d be damned if I was going to go ask him . My father bad bought all the land on both sides of this old logging road , nearly a hundred acres in all . He built the six cabins and lived in each one of them off and on over the years , renting out the others to tourists in the summer , hunters in the fall , and snow-mobilers in the winter . When I came up here and moved into the first cabin , I kept renting out the rest of them . It was a good way to stay busy without having to go anywhere . A few years after I moved in , somebody bought the couple of acres between my father \'s land and the main road . I was a little worried about what the new owner might           triple-decker summer home , with every tree knocked down so they could maybe get a view of the lake . But it did n\'t happen that way . It was one man , and I watched him build his own cabin by hand . If my father had been around to see it , he would have approved of this man \'s work . I got to know him eventually . You do n\'t live on the same road up here with one other person without running into each other . I \'d plow the road for him . He \'d give me some of the venison from his hunts . He did n\'t drink , so we never did that together , but we did share an adventure or two . I even played in goal one night for his hockey team . The fact that he was an Ojibwa Indian never got in the way of our friendship . Until one day he had to make a choice . I did n\'t hear his truck pull up . With the chain saw roaring away , I would n\'t           at the road and saw his truck parked there . Vinnie Red Sky LeBlanc was standing next to it , watching me . He was wearing his denim jacket with the fur around the collar . I had no idea how long he \'d been there . I shut the chain saw down and wiped my forehead with my sleeve . " You \'re gon na go deaf , " he said . " Where \'s your ear protection ? " " I left them around here someplace . Just ca n\'t find them . " He shook his head at that , then walked right past me to the stacks of logs . Like many Bay Mills Ojibwa , you had to look twice to see the Indian in him . There was a little extra width to his high cheekbones , and a certain calmness in his eyes when he looked at you . You always got the feeling he was thinking carefully about what to say before he said it . " White pine , " he said . " Of course . " " Where \'d           City . " " I thought I saw a truck going by , " he said . " That was what , Wednesday ? " " He was supposed to be here Monday . " " Couple of these logs I would n\'t use on a doghouse , " he said . " Like this one right here . " " I know . I was gon na put that one aside . " He slipped his hands under the log and lifted it . He was maybe three inches shorter than me , and thirty pounds lighter , but I would n\'t have wanted to fight the man , on the ice or off . He carried the log a few steps and tossed it in the brush . " That \'ll be your waste pile , " he said . " I see another one right down here . " " You do n\'t have to do that , Vinnie . I know which ones are bad . " He went over to the cabin , knelt down , and ran his hand along one of the logs           he said , " and yet this one right here seems to be part of your wall already . " " When did you become the county inspector ? " I said . " I did n\'t see it in the newspaper . " Continues ... \n Chapter One " CHESSIE - oh , Chess , you \'ll never guess what they \'re saying in the post office . " Francesca Lloyd frowned slightly , but her attention did n\'t waver from her computer screen as her younger sister burst into the room . " Jen , I \'ve told you a hundred times , you \'re not supposed to come to this part of the house , and especially not during working hours . " " Oh , nuts . " Jenny perched on a corner of the big desk , pushing aside some of the neat piles of paper to make room for herself . " I simply had to see you . Anyway , The Ogre wo n\'t be back from London for hours yet , " she added airily . " I checked that his car was n\'t there before I came round . " Chessie \'s lips tightened . " Please do n\'t call him that . It \'s neither kind nor fair . " " Well , nor is he . " Jenny pulled a face . " Besides , you may not need this job for much longer .           Mrs Cummings telling the post mistress that she \'s had instructions to open Wenmore Court again . And that means that Alastair \'s coming back at last . " Chessie \'s fingers stilled momentarily on the keyboard . For a moment her heart leapt , painfully - almost brutally . She kept her voice even . " Well , that \'s good news for the village . The house has been closed up for far too long . But it wo n\'t make much difference to us . " " Oh , Chess , do n\'t be silly . " Jenny gave an impatient sigh . " It makes all the difference in the world . After all , you and Alastair were practically engaged . " " No . " Chessie turned on her . " We were not . And you \'ve got to stop saying that . " " Well , you would have been if his beastly father had n\'t sent him to business school in the States , " Jenny retorted . " Everyone knows that . You were crazy about each other . "           typing again . " And a hell of a lot has happened since then . Nothing \'s the same . " " Do you really think that would make any difference to Alastair ? " Jenny demanded scornfully . " I think it might . " It still hurt to remember how the weekly letters had dwindled to one a month , and then petered out altogether before the end of their first year apart . Since then , her only contact had been a brief note of condolence following her father \'s death . And if Alastair had known that Neville Lloyd had died , then he almost certainly knew the circumstances of his death , she thought , wincing . " God , you can be a real drag sometimes , " Jenny accused . " I thought you \'d be thrilled . I ran all the way home to tell you . " " Jen , we should n\'t make assumptions . " Chessie tried to speak gently . " After all , it \'s been three years and a lot of water under the bridge .           and I. " There \'d been a time when she \'d rejoiced in those three words , she thought sadly . When they \'d had meaning - even a future ... She squared her shoulders . " And now I \'ve got to get on . Please do n\'t let Mr Hunter come back and catch you here again . " " Oh , all right . " Jenny slid mutinously off the desk . " But how great it would be if Alastair asked you to marry him . Imagine being able to tell The Ogre what to do with his rotten job . " Chessie stifled a sigh . " It is not a rotten job , " she returned levelly . " It \'s good , and well paid . It keeps food in our mouths , and a roof over our heads . And it allows us to go on living in our old home . " " As servants , " Jenny said with intense bitterness . " Big deal . " And she went out , slamming the door behind her . Chessie sat           It was disturbing that even after all this time , Jenny had not been able to come to terms with the admittedly devastating change in their circumstances . She could not seem to cope with the fact that Silvertrees House no longer belonged to them - or that the only part of it they were entitled to occupy was the former house-keeper \'s flat . " Yet , why not ? " Chessie asked herself , wryly . " After all , that \'s what I am - the housekeeper . " " I do n\'t want , or need , a lot of staff , " Miles Hunter had told her at that first , fraught interview . " I require the house to be run efficiently , and without fuss , plus secretarial support . " " Meaning what , precisely ? " Chessie looked impassively back at her potential employer , trying to weigh him up . It was n\'t easy . His clothes , casually elegant , were at odds with the harshly etched lines of his face , accentuated by the scar that ran from           The cool drawl gave nothing away , either . " I use a very old portable typewriter , Miss Lloyd . I always have , but my publishers now require my manuscripts on computerised disks . I presume you can handle that ? " She nodded wordlessly . " Good . On the domestic side it will be up to you what additional assistance you require . I imagine you \'ll need a daily help at least . But I insist on peace and quiet while I \'m writing . I also value my privacy . " He paused . " I \'m aware this may be difficult for you . After all , you \'ve lived at Silvertrees all your life , and you \'re used to having the free run of the place . That , I \'m afraid , ca n\'t happen any more . " " No , " Chessie said . " I - I can see that . " There was another brief silence . " Of course , " he said , " you may not wish to take the job on ,           problems for both of us . " The blue eyes were vivid against the deep tan of his thin face . " So , how about it , Miss Lloyd ? Are you prepared to sacrifice your pride , and accept my offer ? " She ignored the note of faint mockery in his voice . " I ca n\'t afford pride , Mr Hunter . Not with a young sister to support , and educate . I \'d be more than grateful for the job , and the accommodation . " She paused . " And we \'ll try not to impinge on your seclusion . " " Do n\'t just try , Miss Lloyd . Succeed . " He drew the file on the desk in front of him towards him , signalling the interview was ending . As she rose he added , " I \'ll get my lawyers to draw up the necessary lease , and contract of employment . " " Is that really necessary ? " There was dismay in her voice . " It sounds a bit daunting . Could n\'t we have           mouth seemed to twist harshly , or was it just the scar that gave that impression ? " I \'ve never been a gentleman , Miss Lloyd , " he remarked . " And appearances are against you , too . I think it better to put things on a businesslike footing from day one - do n\'t you ? " And that , Chessie thought drearily , had been that . She was allowed to occupy the former housekeeper \'s flat , with Jenny , for a peppercorn rent , as long as she continued to work for Miles Hunter . At the time , desperate as she had been , bleak with guilt and grief over her father , it had seemed a lifeline . Too good a proposition to turn down . Now , with hindsight , she wondered if she should have refused . Taken Jenny and herself far away from old memories - old associations . But that would have meant finding a new school for Jenny just before an important exam year , and she \'d been loth to create any more disruption in           seemed worth it . Jenny had done well , and was expected to go on to university in due course . She \'d get a student loan , but it would still mean all kinds of extra expenditure . So Chessie seemed contracted to several more years of transferring Miles Hunter \'s starkly exciting thrillers onto the computer , and keeping his home running like the clockwork he demanded . It had not , she reflected , been the easiest of rides . As she \'d suspected at that first meeting , he was n\'t the easiest person in the world to work for . He expected consistently high standards , and could be icily sarcastic and unpleasant if these were not met , as several of the daily helps who \'d come and gone could vouchsafe . But while Chessie had adhered strictly to her own territory outside working hours , Jenny had not always been so scrupulous . ( Continues ... ) \n Chapter One Susan had a hard time believing it had come to this . If someone had told her a week ago that she would be seriously considering hiring a private investigator , she would have laughed . People came to her for help . She was the sensible , self-reliant one who always handled whatever problem came her way . At least , she had been . She drove past the White Knight Investigations \' offices every day on her way to work . When You Need Help , Call On A White Knight , the sign said . The promise implicit in that motto never failed to conjure up the romantic image of a tall , stalwart warrior in silver armor charging on his sturdy steed to help some hapless heroine . A nice fantasy . But the key word here was fantasy . Even if the King Arthur legends could be believed and men with high ideals had rescued damsels in distress in the sixth century , she knew perfectly well that damsels unlucky or foolish enough to get themselves into distressful situations in the twenty-first century had better be ready to rescue themselves . Yet           she approached the White Knight offices this morning . She wanted to believe , because she was in a mess . And she gladly would have traded all the idealistic heroes in history on white horses for the help of one fat , balding modern-day cynic driving a VW Bug - as long as he was a competent and intelligent investigator . Their number was on the sign . Maybe she \'d call for an appointment . Then again , maybe not . She \'d gotten herself into a situation that was as embarrassing as hell for herself to accept , much less explain to someone else . An unexpected light in the office window had Susan turning the steering wheel of her SUV . The offices were always dark at this hour . That light beamed down on her like a special invitation , a message that someone waited for her up there , someone who would listen and would be willing to help . She maneuvered her vehicle into the parking lot and switched off the engine . She sat behind the wheel for a moment as the           did n\'t lead their lives by attributing the guiding hand of fate to an unexpected office light . Still , as long as she was here , it probably would n\'t hurt to go up . The front door to the office-building complex was open , a bakery shop on the first floor already filling the foyer with the warm aromas of yeast and rising dough . Normally such smells would have been welcome . But today she could n\'t get away from them quickly enough . She dashed for the elevator and punched the button for the top floor where the White Knight offices were located . The elevator made its journey with an efficient swoosh of gears . When the doors opened , she stepped out on a lovely curved landing . A floor-to-ceiling picture window overlooked the small city of Silver Valley , jewel-like in the early morning light . As tempted as she was to linger over the dazzling scene , she knew that if she did n\'t continue with this sudden impulse , her common sense was going to kick in and have her retreating           from the street was spilling out from the reception area of the White Knight offices . Her footsteps made no sound on the thick carpet as she made her way toward it . She halted in the shadows just outside the open door and peered inside . Her eyes swept over the oak desk , the thick gold carpet , the tasteful assortment of art hanging on the pastel walls , the impressive expanse of windows . But it was the man facing those windows who claimed her real attention . He was at least six-three , with shoulders and arms like a logger \'s . His full bark-brown hair was cleanly cut at the nape of his neck . A dark green sweater stretched over his muscled back . Tailored black slacks hugged his long legs . One of his huge hands hung casually by his side . The other was holding something in front of him that she could n\'t see . The solid strength of his body and the calm , innate confidence in his stance put Susan immediately in mind of the sturdy cedar that had           . That cedar had borne the weight of her treehouse , weathered the worst of winter \'s storms and soaked up the tears shed by her young self . Her heart filled with sudden hope . Maybe , just maybe , the impulse that had brought her here would n\'t prove to be so crazy , after all . David savored his coffee as he watched the traffic beneath his window . Mornings were always his favorite part of the day ; he enjoyed watching the world wake up and get busy , especially in this part of the world . Western Washington would n\'t push open its coffin lid of clouds to let in any real sun until summer . He did n\'t mind enduring the months of overcast skies ahead . The rain was a familiar companion , and he had learned that there was comfort in the familiar . A man could handle anything when he knew what to expect . A long , difficult case now hinged on an interview he would conduct with his client \'s runaway daughter in a few hours . Getting the           what he had to show her to help him . But his approach also had to be right . He had come in early so as to plan what he would say to her . He checked his watch . Barely eight . He had another full hour before the office officially opened and anyone else arrived . Plenty of time to - " Excuse me . " David spun around so sharply at the sound of the unexpected voice behind him that coffee splashed out of his cup . He found himself suddenly face-to-face with large , luminous eyes the color of summer clover . She stood in the doorway , a slim silhouette in a dark business suit with matching , low-heeled pumps . Across her forehead was a curve of shiny , golden-brown bangs . The rest of her hair fell in one long , thick braid to the gentle swell of her right breast . Her cosmetic-free face reflected the pink , creamy glow of youth . She did n\'t look a day over twenty-one . " I \'m sorry I startled you , " she           David like the melody of a forgotten song . She took a tentative step into the room . " If you have some paper towels , I can try to soak up that stain on the carpet . " " No , " he said in a tone that was far too abrupt and gruff and had nothing whatsoever to do with her offer to help and everything to do with the unwelcome surprise of her . His thoughts must have shown on his face , because her open , expectant expression quickly faded . " I \'ve obviously come at a bad time , " she said , and turned to leave . " No , " he heard himself barking again in that same uncivil tone . He took a deep breath . This was foolish . He was a professional . She was a client . " Come in , " he said , carefully modulating both his manner and tone . " The clerk will see to the carpet when he arrives . I \'m David Knight . " He set his coffee cup on the           was determined that this woman would see him as he really was - a cool , cordial investigator , in control of himself . She did not immediately take his hand but instead studied his face . There was a question in her eyes . But whatever she wanted to know , she seemed hesitant to ask . When she finally stepped forward and slipped her hand into his , he was taken aback by the warmth and strength of her clasp . " I \'m Susan Carter . " Her name did n\'t ring a bell . Not that all of the firm \'s clients were known to him . But he was surprised that no one had mentioned her over the dinner table the night before . His brothers seldom passed up an opportunity to talk about an attractive woman . Could she be a special client taken on by his mom or dad ? " Is something wrong , Mr. Knight ? " David realized that while silently asking himself these questions , he \'d been unconsciously gripping her hand . He released his hold and retraced           telephone . Did n\'t matter whose client she was . What mattered was that he arrange for her to be taken care of so he could get on with what he had to do . " Who \'s handling your case , Ms. Carter ? I \'ll call and let them know you \'re here . " " There \'s no one to call . This is my first visit . " ( Continues ... ) \n The Heroes \' Walk Looking back now , I can see that I spent my seventh-grade year in a state of depression , imprisoned behind the red-brick , black-iron walls of All Souls Preparatory . All Souls is a private , mostly Catholic school in Bethel , New Jersey , about twenty miles east of Princeton . Back when I was a student , All Souls had two prominent statues on the campus . Franklin D. Roosevelt stood outside the Student Center , which was a little strange since the real President Roosevelt could n\'t stand . Yet there he was , with one hand on a cane and the other hand raised in a friendly wave . John F. Kennedy , the first Catholic president , stood outside Kennedy Hall . He was pointing energetically into the air , as if he were speaking . On the last day of school that year , I was sitting in class in Kennedy Hall and looking through the window at FDR . Across the road , the Lowery Library was nearing the end of a major renovation . As part of this , Father Thomas , the headmaster of the           and Kennedy were to be moved to join a new statue of General Henry M. " Hollerin \' Hank " Lowery in an impressive new entranceway to the library . The entrance would consist of the three statues , a brass informational plaque about each one , and a slab withthe words the heroes \' walk carved into it . That was why Father Leonard , my history teacher , was spending one last class period droning on about World War II and the heroic efforts of General Henry M. Lowery to alert America to the dangers of Adolf Hitler and Nazism . Father Leonard was the twin brother of the headmaster , Father Thomas . They had both attended All Souls Preparatory some thirty years before ; now the paths of their lives had circled around and brought them both back to their beloved alma mater . I hated All Souls Preparatory . I hated the uniforms ; I hated the snobbery ; I hated the tradition . I was an outcast there , and I associated only with other outcasts . One of them , sitting immediately to           Leonard pointed to him warily and said , " Mr. Chander , I trust this comment is pertinent . " " Oh yes , Father . It is most pertinent . " " Fine . Then you may proceed . " " I read that General Lowery was not really opposed to the Nazis . In fact , he thought the Nazis would win the war easily , and he advised President Roosevelt to make a deal with Hitler as soon as he could . " Father Leonard looked pained . " I do n\'t think those are facts , Pinak . But if you would care to do some independent study in that area , I will give you extra credit for your research . " " I do n\'t need any more credit , Father . I already have an average far above one hundred . I just wanted to perhaps start a discussion . " " No . We need not discuss rumors and half-truths and falsehoods . The historical record is perfectly clear about what the General wrote and said at the time . " Pinak           Leonard always looked uncomfortable when talking about the late General Lowery . Fathers Leonard and Thomas both believed , faithfully , in the legend of Lowery as a fierce Hitler-hater and Nazi-fighter . In return for that faith , the Lowery family had established a million-dollar trust fund for All Souls Preparatory . All Souls had been General Lowery \'s prep school , back when it was all boys and they all lived there . Then it was his son \'s and his grandson \'s prep school , and now it was his great-grandson \'s prep school . That great-grandson , Henry M. Lowery IV , was seated in front of me and to the left . Hank Lowery was what is known there as a " legacy . " I , on the other hand , was what is known there as a " scholarship . " Worse than that , I was an " employee scholarship . " My mother worked as Father Thomas \'s secretary , and , thanks to that , I was allowed to attend the school tuition-free . My mother had worked the same           All Souls and then gone on to Princeton , where she earned a degree in history . My future prospects , however , were not so bright . Unlike Pinak , who was an academic star , I barely scraped by with C \'s . The only other kid I really associated with was Manetti . I knew him from sixth grade back at Garden State Middle School . He was an employee scholarship , too . His father was in charge of buildings and construction at All Souls , which meant that Manetti actually had it worse than me . At least my parent was hidden away in an office . His was very visible--always walking around on campus in an orange hard hat , or driving around noisily in one of his company trucks . I was watching one of those Manetti Construction trucks unload equipment when the girl in front of me turned and handed me a note . There was no name on the note , so I set it on the corner of my desk , temporarily ignoring it until I heard a sharp ,           , erupted face of Hank Lowery IV . He pointed a stubby finger at the note . I obediently picked it up , opened it , and read this printed message : You \'re dead . I looked back at Lowery , puzzled . He clenched his jaw and then shook his large head from left to right . He pointed first to the note and then to Pinak . When I finally understood his message , I passed the note over . As Pinak opened the note and read those two words , his dark Indian complexion turned pale with fear . Shortly after that exchange , Father Leonard \'s lifeless lecture , and the school day , and the school year , all came to an end with the ringing of the bell . As we did every day , Pinak , Manetti , and I walked together to the Administration Building . Manetti and I had to wait for our employee parents to finish work ; Pinak simply had nothing better to do . He asked his mother to pick him up later so that he could           probably regretted that arrangement . Even before we got out of the classroom , some kid muttered to Pinak , " Lowery \'s gon na kick your ass outside . " From the Hardcover edition . Continues ... \n 1 How Angel Peterson Got His Name He is as old as me and that means he has had a life , has raised children and made a career and succeeded and maybe failed a few times and can look back on things , on old memories . Carl Peterson--that \'s the name his mother and father gave him , but from the age of thirteen and for the rest of his life not a soul , not his wife or children or any friend has ever known him by that name . He is always called Angel . Angel Peterson , and I was there when he got his name . We lived in northwestern Minnesota , up near the Canadian border and not far from the eastern border of North Dakota . The area is mostly cleared now and almost all farmland , but in the late forties and early fifties it was thickly forested and covered with small lakes and was perhaps the best hunting and fishing country in the world , absolutely crawling with fish and game . My friends and I spent most of our time in the woods , hunting , fishing or           town lives as well . Because the area was so remote , many farms still did not have electricity , nearly none had phones and the rare ones that did were on party lines , with all users on the same line so that anybody could listen in to anybody else ( called rubbernecking . ) Individual phones were identified by the rings : two longs and a short ring would be one farm , two shorts and a long another farm and so forth . You would call somebody on a separate line by hand cranking a ringer on the side of your phone for the operator--one very long ring--and when she came on ( it was always a woman ) you would ask her to place your call , as in " Alice , I would like to talkto the Sunveldt farm over by Middle River , " and the operator would ring them for you . Anybody on your own party line you would call by simply cranking their ring ( my grandmother was a short , a long and a short ) . In town we           did n\'t always work , and that was about it . There was--this is important--no television . There were just two channels in the major cities on the East and West Coasts . Almost nobody in town had a set . A TV set at that time was a huge buzzing , hissing black-and-white monster that had the added benefit of being dangerous . The coating on the inside of the picture tube required no less than forty-two thousand volts to operate , an amount that could easily kill fifteen or twenty horses . When television finally did come to the small towns up in Minnesota many a cat was turned into something close to a six-hundred-watt lightbulb by sticking his nose back in the power supply area of a console television set , trying to investigate the little crackling sounds and blue glow that came out of the ventilation holes . On his twelfth birthday , my pal Wayne Halverson licked the end of his finger and stuck it near the ventilation panel on his family \'s new RCA set . ( Even though there was no television station           it for a conversation piece and a place to put their bowling trophies , but my grandmother said the Halversons had always put on airs ever since Dewey , who was Wayne \'s great-great-grandfather , was kicked in the head by a workhorse and found that he could do accounting . ) Wayne never actually touched the top of the main rectifier tube and so did n\'t get the full jolt , which would have cooked him on the spot , but it arced over to his finger and a lesser charge , say enough to light two or three single-family dwellings for a week or so , slammed him back into the wall and left him unconscious for several minutes . He later claimed that the incident was what made him the only one in our group who could actually talk to girls . Radio was king and every Sunday night we would go to the Texaco station where Archie Swenson worked and listen to Gunsmoke on the radio . Matt Dillon ( played by William Conrad in the radio version ) would say things like " I \'m           chancy kind of job and makes a man watchful and a little bit lonely but somebody has to do it . " Archie let us buy bottles of Coca-Cola for a nickel and bags of peanuts to put in the Cokes for another nickel and sit and listen to the radio as long as we did n\'t bother him at work and most especially if we did n\'t bother him if any older high school girls came by for gas or just to flirt with him . We were all twelve and thirteen and in Archie \'s world not quite human . Archie was very , very cool . He was sixteen and had a perfect ducktail haircut and worked at the Texaco station full-time because he \'d dropped out of school . He wore Levi \'s pulled so low that if he had n\'t worn a T-shirt tucked in you would have seen the crack in his butt . He smoked and kept a pack of cigarettes rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt and as boys we worshiped him , and also , much more important for the           For the times , it was a very hot car . It was a \' 39 Ford sedan with an original V-8 engine and even though it was well over ten years old , with years of rough use during the Second World War , when small-town cars had to double as trucks and sometimes even tractors , even so it was a fast car . But more , Archie had " done things " to the car to make it faster . We were too ignorant to know how , but we were sure he had chopped this or enlarged that or channeled here and ported there to make it more powerful , and V-8 Fords were known for their speed . Some could do well over eighty miles an hour . We had read about some hot rods that would do a hundred miles an hour but dizzying speeds like that were usually only achieved on racetracks . Archie \'s car was also cool because he had a knob on the steering wheel that was made of clear Plexiglas and had a picture of a partially nude woman           understood about those long-ago times before the stage is finally set for Angel . First , that part of northern Minnesota is completely and unbelievably flat . During successive ice ages , it was scoured flat by glaciers bulldozing their way south . When the glaciers melted , the land became an enormous inland freshwater sea called Lake Agassiz , which later receded to form the Great Lakes . The land is so flat that if you cut down the trees and paved the area , you could probably roll a bowling ball from northern Minnesota to Montana without half trying . Second , without television the only news , outside newspapers , came once a week at the theater matinee , when we would watch something called newsreels , short black-and-white film clips of the week \'s events . And so in mid-January of 1954 , when the Minnesota winter had settled its icy hand on the north country , it came to pass that four of us , all thirteen years old , went to a Saturday matinee showing of a really interesting and informative film about how           experiments ) had caused a species of common ant to mutate and grow to be huge , forty-foot-tall monsters . The radiation also made the ants develop an overwhelming need to eat human flesh . The movie was called Them ! and we all agreed it was well worth the fifteen cents \' admission and the extra dime for popcorn and another nickel for a box of Dots . \n Must Love Dragons By Stephanie Rowe Warner Forever Stephanie Rowe Theresa Nichols was going to starve to death and no one cared . She did n\'t know which was ticking her off more , the fact that she had n\'t had her no-carb pretzel fix in a week , or the fact that Quincy LaValle had apparently forgotten her yet again , like everyone else in her life . Her stomach growled and a sharp pain ground through her gut . Who needs to eat ? Certainly not an eleven-foot winged dragon under house arrest , hidden away because people in New York City would freak out at the sight of a real dragon . No need to be spotted by someone who could start the next world war with shrieks of invasions , Martians , and other such panic-inducing nonsense . Because of the close-mindedness of humans , she \'d been stuck behind closed doors for two hundred years , and quite frankly , it was getting old . Especially when she was withering away , alone and forgotten and starving to death . Since she \'d been put under Quincy \'s neglectful care , she \'d lost           , dammit , and dragons had needs ! Food , violence , destruction , incineration . None of which she was allowed to indulge in Quincy \'s house . Heaven forbid she burn anything up or turn his neighbors into crispy critters . Being deprived of food was making it that much harder to resist all her otherdragon desires . She groaned and leaned her head against the fridge , willing away her insatiable craving to blow up his kitchen . Keep it together , Theresa . You can handle this . She let out a deep breath that was a little too smoky for comfort , then marched over to the phone and punched the speed dial . Again . And again , his answering machine came on . " Quincy ! It \'s Theresa . I have n\'t eaten in two days and I \'m starving . I know you do n\'t care about me or the Goblet , but your brother \'s now the Assistant Guardian , in case you forgot . He \'ll kick your butt if he comes home from his honeymoon to find that           die of starvation while you were obsessing about some stupid math equation that no one but you cares about . And the Council will skewer you if you screw up Guardianship . Literally . " She paused to take a breath , forcing herself not to shudder at the thought of the Council , the ruthless governing body in charge of the Guardians and the Goblet . Guardians who screwed up were seriously toast , even Interim Guardians . " And if you do n\'t get home with food in thirty minutes , I \'m burning down your house and moving in with Becca . " She slammed down the phone and glared at the Goblet of Eternal Youth , which was currently masquerading as an espresso machine . " Mona ! This is all your fault . " The espresso machine said nothing . Of course it would n\'t . In two hundred years , Mona had never so much as hinted at being sorry for turning Theresa permanently into dragon form . Yeah , yeah , so Theresa was the one who \'d actually drunk from the Goblet           \'s duty to warn her that a sip while in dragon form would keep her that way forever ? Apparently not . Theresa yanked open the freezer and stared at the contents . Empty . She supposed she could eat some more ice cubes . She \'d at least be hydrated when she died of starvation . Bonus . Or maybe she could eat some chairs . Nothing wrong with fiber , right ? Now that Justine , her best friend , roomie , and personal servant for the last two hundred years , was off on her honeymoon , it was all too apparent what kind of a life Theresa had : none . No job . No social life . No friends . And most important , no way to get food . She slammed the door shut as her stomach rumbled again and a burning sensation clawed at her belly . She \'d bet a box of Vic \'s Pretzels that her body was beginning to eat itself . Would n\'t that be a fun way to die ? No ! A dragon should die a violent           . Dammit ! She slammed her tail against the fridge , too hungry to bother checking to see if she \'d left a dent . She was n\'t even allowed to order delivery because she was guarding Mona , and it was a big no-no to have strangers parading up to the door when the Goblet of Eternal Youth was hiding out . You never knew if the skinny little delivery boy might be packing a sword in his stay-hot pizza bag . Plus , how was she supposed to explain her appearance when she answered the door ? No , you \'re not really seeing an emaciated eleven-foot dragon with gold eyes . It \'s the scent from the pizza causing your hallucinations . Yeah , right . She stalked over to the window of Quincy \'s house and stared at the darkened suburb . If she were in her own condo , she could probably get Xavier the doorman to get her some food , but no , their condo was still a shambles after Justine and Derek had gotten a little trigger happy with Becca \'s machine           calling Becca , Satan \'s favorite Rivka and right-hand badass , but finally dismissed it . The Rivka had more important things to do than bring carryout to a dragon , and Theresa had too much pride to beg . She closed her eyes and dug her claws into the windowsill . You are not hungry . You are not lonely . You are a goddess . The shattering of the wood jerked her back to the present , and she jerked her claws away from the window . Even the house was n\'t built for helping a dragon through the throes of misery . There was only one thing that would help her now . One man . If Zeke was n\'t online , heaven help her and the neighborhood she was hiding out in . She grabbed her computer and IM \'d Zeke , the only man she \'d had cybersex with in the last six months . Six months of monogamy for Theresa Nichols , former Queen of the Sluts . Astounding , was n\'t it ? Just proved how good a cyberlover Zeke was . For           all other outlets was quite the feat . Thank God for Zeke . " Zeke ? You there ? " she typed . His reply was instant . " Yep . You ? " Tension eased from her body at his immediate response and she smiled , imagining what his voice must sound like . Deep . Manly . He probably had thick whiskers that would make a woman tremble with longing . Zeke was definitely a badass . She could sense the undercurrent of violence in him . She loved bad boys . What dragon would n\'t ? Whoever she dated had to be able to deal with a girl who liked to burn things up and ate six pizzas for an afternoon snack . " I bought a new piece of lingerie off the Internet yesterday . Want me to describe it ? " Silence . She frowned at his hesitation , and an anxiety spark shot out of her nose and sizzled on the keyboard . " Zeke ? Do n\'t leave me hanging . Not tonight . " He finally typed an answer . " Listen           upright in Quincy \'s microfiber recliner , slamming the footrest back to the floor with an ominous thud . " I ca n\'t meet you ! " She scowled as a wave of longing washed over her , smashing her claws onto the keyboard as she typed her response . " I \'m still in isolation at the FBI containment center , remember ? They have n\'t figured out how to keep my contagious disease from infecting everyone who comes within ten feet of me . " She felt a little guilty about the lie , but it was n\'t as if she could tell him she was a dragon . Besides , being locked up in an FBI containment facility was sort of dramatic and cool , and way better than her real life . " I think you \'re avoiding me . " She grinned at his perceptiveness , imagining his brows furrowed in aggravation as he typed . " Tell that to the dude with the machine gun guarding my door . " " Give me his number and I \'ll call him up . " Some           " He wo n\'t get close enough to talk to me . Afraid I \'ll infect him . " " Is n\'t that convenient ? " Her tail switched at his thinly veiled sarcasm and she accidentally dropped a puff of ash onto Quincy \'s hand-woven carpet from India . She \'d been fending off Zeke \'s requests to meet for months , but something felt different tonight . Or maybe her perception of reality was being distorted by the fact that her stomach was beginning to eat her brain . " No , it \'s not convenient . I \'d love to meet you in person and engage in some real flesh-to-flesh activities . " Understatement of the year . Cybersex was better than nothing , but it was no substitute for having a man wrapped around her . She \'d even had Justine buy her some of the aftershave Zeke said he wore , and she sprayed it around whenever they had cybersex . The woodsy , masculine scent was nearly enough to give her an orgasm on its own , let alone when Zeke was working his           sleep , she sprayed it on her pillow and pretended he was there , hugging her pillow to her chest . Not that she \'d admit that to anyone . Dragons did n\'t need nighttime comfort , and she was no exception . She was just sexually deprived and she loved to bask in the scent of the man of her fantasies . And if she liked it when he talked about his favorite movies and places he \'d like to take her on their first date , it was only because she was so desperately lonely for any kind of a real life , even if it was vicariously through Zeke . Not because she liked him or anything . Because that would be incredibly stupid , given her permanently scaly state . " Seriously , T , I do n\'t care about your infectious disease . I can buy a biohazard suit anywhere . We need to meet . " Theresa \'s heart started to pound and her hind claws curled into the floor . Zeke was her one contact with the outside world . He was the           wild and daring cybersex and late-night gossip sessions were the only outlet that kept her sane , since violence , gorging on food , and incineration were n\'t options . She took a deep breath and tried to focus . She had to reel him in before he ruined everything , before he demanded what she could n\'t give . " What \'s the point in meeting if you \'re wearing a biohazard suit ? We would n\'t be able to have sex . " His reply was quick , as if he \'d anticipated her answer . " I want to know what you look like . " She scowled . She was an eleven-foot winged dragon with bluish-green scales and golden eyes . Would that do it for him ? Doubted it . " Sorry . No pictures , remember ? " It had been so long since she \'d been in human form , she was n\'t sure she \'d even recognize herself . Silence . At his hesitation , Theresa shoved the computer off her lap and jumped to her feet , pacing past the beautiful           to burn up . Heat roiled through her , struggled to escape . A spark slipped out of her nose and landed on the hardwood floor . Crap ! She stomped it out , then spun back to face her computer when she heard it beep . She was afraid to read Zeke \'s reply . After a moment she lifted her chin , straightened her tail , and marched back over to read what he \'d written . " I think maybe it \'s time to change the rules . " She growled at the screen . There could be no rule-changing ! Face-to-face meetings were not happening ! " T ? You still there ? I \'m serious . Things need to change . I ca n\'t keep this up . " How dare he ruin the only decent thing in her life by demanding something she could n\'t give , no matter how much she might want to ? She would n\'t let him . Not tonight . " The scientists are here to run more tests on me . Got ta run . " She hesitated           body . " Then she disconnected before he could reply . She slammed the lid closed on her laptop and stomped across the room , ignoring the pictures rattling on the walls . Well , would n\'t that be fine and dandy ? Not only was she starving to death , but she would die alone and sexually frustrated because Zeke was about to bail on her . Forget it . Things had gone too far . A girl had her limits . She smashed her hip into the kitchen door and shoved it open , ignoring the trickle of sparks that dropped on the tile . Quincy would just have to get over a few burn marks . He \'d be lucky if she did n\'t burn down his house by accident . She narrowed her eyes at the espresso machine . " I have to eat , which means it \'s time for a highly illegal field trip . And you \'re coming with me , since I ca n\'t leave you behind unprotected . " She picked up the espresso machine and tried to tuck it under           who was n\'t exactly in top flying shape . " I do n\'t suppose you could turn into something smaller and easier to carry ? " The espresso machine did n\'t so much as flicker . " What if I take you on a flying tour of the New York City skyline so you can see this city that you \'ve been living in for the last five years ? " Mona immediately changed into an ankle bracelet . Theresa grinned , all too familiar with the desperation Mona would be feeling at being locked in her inanimate cell for so long . " That \'s my girl . Maybe we can be friends after all . " At least there was something in this world that was more desperate than she was . Forty-five minutes later , Theresa was perched on the roof of the Vic \'s Pretzels that was down the street from the condo she used to live in . She was wearing her favorite come-hither outfit : a leather miniskirt , a black lace bra under a transparent white top , the topaz earrings she \'d           what if dragons do n\'t have ears ? The scales located on the side of her head worked just fine ) , a new diamond stud in the piercing at the end of her tail , and , of course , her new ankle bracelet . She might not have any breasts or even a waist to do the outfit justice , and her blue scales were n\'t exactly sexy , but one should never underestimate the effect that sexy clothes can have on a woman \'s mood . Or a dragon \'s . She took a deep breath and inhaled the amazing scent of fresh dough rising , letting it soak into her lungs . Vic \'s No-Carb Pretzels were her reason for living , definitely worth taking a forbidden trip out into the night air . The sounds of the humans working the ovens drifted up to her , and she took a moment to sort out their scents . There were at least three of them , two male and one female . Probably one person manning the kitchens and two customers getting their late-night pretzel fix           Someone would notice three piles of human ash . She growled , realizing that food would have to suffice to appease her needs . If she could get the people outside for a few minutes ... She eyed the roof and found what she was looking for . Did n\'t anyone have the foresight to protect their vents from dragons anymore ? She glided over to the vent ( yes , she might weigh several tons , but that did n\'t mean she had to stop practicing the double-jointed-hips walk that had brought men to their knees two hundred years ago ) and pressed her face up to it . " Hope you all are wearing your gas masks . " Was n\'t this going to be fun ? She had n\'t tortured humans in forever . She grinned , rolled some smoke around in her chest for a moment , then expelled a huge black cloud into the vent . Then , for kicks , she did it again . The sound of coughing and the scent of human alarm drifted up to her , and Theresa flopped down           . It was n\'t actual destruction , but it soaked into her pores and eased the desperation off her needs . It took less than three minutes for the humans to vacate the premises . Once they were hacking away out front , she sat up , shook off the soothing effects of the assault , and coasted down to the back door . She tugged on it , found it locked , then grinned with delight and yanked it free , along with the doorframe . She tossed the still-locked unit into the alley and scooted inside the kitchen of Vic \'s Pretzels . Three feet inside the door , she was hit by the intense aroma of baking dough and melted butter and fell flat on her face . Holy mother of pearl . She groaned and rolled onto her back , drinking in the heavenly odors . Cinnamon . Fresh bread . Melted frosting for the dessert pretzels . Her claws curved against her chest and she closed her eyes , inhaling deeply as euphoria slackened her muscles , slowed her heart rate . She would never           clang caught her attention , and she shook her head , trying to clear it . This was n\'t a safe environment . She should n\'t be sprawled on the floor . She tried to uncurl her claws , but she was too relaxed , too overcome by lassitude . ( Continues ... ) by Stephanie Rowe \n Trials can have moments of truth subtle , unexpected , even magical . Like the sudden stillness of songbirds or animal tracks filling with water or a name called from a dream . All at once a meaning comes to light , if you \'re paying attention . If you \'re not so taken up in the action you miss it , a revelation that flares and blows out . I was incidental to the action in Stillwell v. The Western Pacific Railroad . As the court-appointed conservator for Dale Stillwell , my only job was to approve a settlement between the company and the injured brakeman and his wife . Ten minutes into Stillwell \'s testimony , the adjuster for the Western Pacific \'s captive insurer had seen the writing on the wall . The robber barons were going to get hammered again . It was settlement time . Given Stillwell \'s impairments , the judge and lawyers wanted a conservator to bless the negotiations . As a piece of legal work the Stillwell case made no particular impression , but I \'ll see the facts of the accident as long as I live . I probably would           the Colfax Center for Rehabilitation , where June Stillwell was warehoused in Denver with other hopeless patients . December 25 , 1993 . Triple overtime at the Western Pacific switching yard in Laramie , Wyoming , for the unsentimental few who \'d service locomotives on Christmas Day . June Mooney might as well sign up . Her daughter was spending the day with June \'s ex . Her father was snowed in seven hours away in Lander . Dale Stillwell showed up too . A loner , that was no surprise . Christmas was just another day . June was the only female engineer at the Laramie yard . She put Stillwell on the lead of the three-engine string she was hostling in to be serviced . Dale Stillwell was quiet , good-looking in an offbeat way . Wiry , tough , aloof , he \'d worked June \'s trains once or twice , rarely talking , always moving , quick as a cat . June liked to know what made folks tick . She \'d wondered about his hidden depths . From the cab of the trailing locomotive June           by . Her task was to nose the string through the maze of track and on into the roundhouse . The yard was backed up with cars going nowhere on Christmas . Stillwell stood outside atop the lead engine , checking switches and hand-signaling go-aheads back to June . The yardmaster in the diesel tower radioed permission for June to come inbound . There should n\'t have been any other power out there any other locomotives , cranked and manned . June \'s engine started down a line that curved , then converged with a cutoff spur , the two lines merging to form a curving Y , a gantlet . Neither knew it but an outbound coal train was standing on the cutoff , fouling her tracks , the brakeman working the switch instead of protecting his power . Stillwell scampered down the front steps and hung off a grab iron to check what lay ahead . From back where the curve began , back in the cab and behind the string , and through the plumes of snow , June could n\'t have seen a thing . I           terror , a weightless feeling . Stillwell \'d trotted up the lead engine \'s hull like a sailor and dropped down the right side for a look . Bent and leaning , one bulky glove hooked on the angle iron , balanced on the ball of a boot . Lulling sounds of rolling wheels and wind-rushed snow . No sky or ground , as the locomotive burrowed into the storm . Straining through the spray at the shadow taking shape ahead like a rockfall blocking the road . June kept the engines coming though he had n\'t waved her on . The cowcatchers closed with six inches to spare . Stillwell raced up the rungs but missed one , cracked a knee , lost his hold on the frozen metal . He slipped between the locomotives as they nearly touched , rolled like a rag in a wringer , dropping when they parted , with two collapsed lungs and eleven snapped bones and a penetrating head wound from a bolt that had jammed his skull like a geartooth . June said she never saw the standing power until she passed           her to stop , she had a man on the ground . June Mooney was the ace switch engineer of the Laramie yard , envied for her gentle throttle . A " Casey Jones , " in railroad lingo , she could close on a coupling at a quarter mile an hour , so smooth that water would n\'t tremble in a cup . But the switchman is the engineer \'s eyes , clearing the track and signaling forward . Nothing \'s worse in a yard than a curve where a hand signal ca n\'t be seen . A radio would have helped , or a relay crew , but they had n\'t been assigned . June was running her string without a go-ahead from Stillwell , but the yardmaster should n\'t have let the outbound power leave . They should have kept the gantlet clear . There were no clearance markers . In zero visibility , how was she to know a locomotive would have to be cleared inside the curve ? She did know . She " sixth-sensed what was going down before it did . Everything ,           screaming . Something kept the power on , " she later typed in her journal , " like I froze up too , paralyzed by fate . " Guilt is a dangerous motivator . Sometimes it leads to breakthroughs . More often it takes you places you \'ve got no business going . While Stillwell was hospitalized , first in Cheyenne for six weeks of drug-induced coma , then down to the brain-injury unit in Boulder , through months of hysteria when he was strapped down , and finally the faltering baby steps of therapy , June was there every day , feeding him , reading , singing , whispering prayerfully , unfolding his balled hands . A year into his recovery she married Dale Stillwell in the Boulder hospital chapel . They got an apartment near the brain-injury unit once Stillwell was discharged to outpatient care . They filed suit in Boulder , kept it out of federal court when the Western Pacific tried to remove , and in Boulder my town it came to trial . Four days into the plaintiff \'s case Dale Stillwell took the stand           house counsel for the WP , and surely for its adjuster , the moment of truth had arrived : halting answers to simple questions that built into a pressured , panicked rush of scenes of snow and steel , agitation , then incoherence that flew apart in convulsive stammers and shuddering tears of frustration and shame , and then the moment . The agonized silence that hung in the courtroom when he gave up trying to speak . Their moment of truth , not mine . I was called in afterward , and I caught sight of a very different man . \n Prologue Eight months after the Battle of Endor The Empire \'s orbiting repair yard at N\'zoth , code-named Black 15 , was of standard Imperial design , with nine great shipways arrayed in a square . On the morning of the retreat from N\'zoth , all nine slips were occupied by Imperial warships . Under most circumstances , nine Star Destroyers together would have been an intimidating sight to any who might come under their guns . But on the morning of the retreat from N\'zoth , only one of the nine was ready for space . That was the sorry assessment of Jian Paret , commander of the Imperial garrison at N\'zoth , as he looked out on the yards from his command center . The orders he had received hours ago were still playing before his eyes : You are ordered to evacuate the planetary garrison to the last man , at best possible speed , using any and all ships that are spaceworthy . Destroy the repair yard and any and all remaining assets before withdrawing from the system . Paret \'s assessment was shared by Nil Spaar , master of the Yevethan underground , as           the first commando team . The orders he had given hours ago were still ringing in his ears : Notify all teams that an Imperial evacuation has been ordered . Execute the primary plan without delay . It is our day for retribution . Our blood is in those vessels , and they will be ours . May each of us honor the name of the Yevetha today . " Nine ships . Nine prizes . The most badly damaged , Redoubtable , had taken terrible punishment in the retreat from Endor . The others ranged from old medium cruisers being upgraded and recommissioned , to the EX-F , a weapons and propulsion test bet built on a Dreadnaught hull . The key to them all was the massive Star Destroyer Intimidator , moored at one of the open slips . Spaceworthy but completely unblooded , it hat been sent to Black 15 from the Core for finish work , to free up a super-class shipway at the commands home shipbuilding yard . There was more than enough room aboard it for the garrison , and more than enough firepower           Paret transferred his command to the bridge of the Intimidator within an hour of receiving his orders . But Intimidator could not leave the yard as quickly as Paret would have liked . He had only one-third of a standard crew aboard , a single watch--too few hands to quickly ready a ship of that size to fly free . Moreover , nine of every ten workers on Black 15 were Yevetha . Paret despised the gaudy-faced skeletons . He would have liked to seal the ship in the interest of security , or to draft additional work details in the interest of speed . But either act would prematurely alert the Yevetha that the occupation force was leaving N\'zoth , threatening the withdrawal from the surface . All Paret would do was call a surprise departure drill and wait out its lengthy checks and countdowns , letting the normal work details continue until the troop transports and the governor \'s shuttle had lifted off and were en route . Then , and only then , could his crew close the hatches , cut the moorings , and turn its           \'s dilemma . He knew all that Paret knew , and much more . For more than five years he had worked to position allies of the underground throughout the conscript workforce . Nothing of importance happened without Nil Spaar \'s swiftly hearing of it . And he had taken the information he had collected and woven it into an elegant scheme . He had put an end to the rash of minor " mistakes " and " accidents , " demanding that those who worked for the Empire show diligence and strive for excellence--while learning everything they could about the ships and their operation . He had seen to it that the Yevetha made themselves indispensable to the Black Fleet \'s yard bosses and earned the trust of its commanders . It was that trust which had allowed the work slowdown in the months since the Battle of Endor to go on unquestioned . It was that trust which had given his Yevetha the run of both the yard and the ships moored in the slips . And it was the patient and calculating exploitation of that trust which           this moment . He knew that he no longer need fear the Harridan , the Victory-class Star Destroyer that had been protecting the yard and patrolling the system . The Harridan had been ordered to the front three weeks ago , joining the Imperial force fighting a losing rear-guard action at Notak . He knew that Paret could not seal the Intimidator against his men , even by ordering a battle-stations lockdown . More than a dozen external hatches in Sections 17 and 21 had been rigged by Yevetha technicians to report that they were secured when they were not , and to report that they were closed when they were not . He knew that even if Intimidator got free of the slip in which it was moored , it would not have a chance to escape or turn its guns on the abandoned vessels . The packages of explosives concealed inside Intimidator \'s hull would break it open like an egg the moment its shields went up and blocked the signal that was safing the bombs . As the work shuttle neared the receiving dock , Nil Spaar           be done had been done , and there was a joyful inevitability about the fighting to come . He had no doubt what the outcome would be . Nil Spaar and the first commando team entered Intimidator through the hatches in Section 17 , while his second , Dar Bille , and the backup team entered through Section 21 . There was no talking . None was necessary . Every member of both teams knew the layout of the ship as well as any Imperial crewman . They moved through it like ghosts , down corridors closed or cleared by friends on work devils , through crawlways and up access ladders that appeared on no construction blueprint . In minutes they had reached the bridge--without ever being challenged , or drawing a weapon , or firing a shot . But they entered the bridge with weapons drawn , knowing exactly which stations would be occupied , where the guard suction was , who could sound a shipwide alarm . Nil Spaar shouted out no warnings , made no theatrical announcement , demanded no surrender . He simply walked briskly across           , and burned the officer \'s face away . As he did , the rest of the team fanned out behind him , each to his own assigned target . Six of Intimidator \'s bridge crew were struck down in the first seconds , sitting at their stations , because of the power that rested at their fingertips . The others , including Commander Paret , quickly ended up facedown on the floor , hands bound behind them . Taking the ship was not difficult . Timing the raid to avoid retribution had always been the challenge . " Signal from the governor \'s shuttle , " called out a Yevetha commando , slipping into the seat at the communications station . " The transports are leaving the surface . No trouble reported . " Nil Spaar nodded approvingly . Acknowledge the signal . Advise the crew that we \'re moving out to pick up the garrison . Notify the yard that Intimidator is leaving . " Like a cluster of insects returning to the hive , the flea of Imperial transports rose from N\'zoth toward the great dagger-shaped Star           were crammed into the insect fleet--soldiers and bureaucrats , technicians and families . " Open all hangars , " said Nil Spaar . Their destination in sight , the transports slowed and began to align themselves on approach vectors . " Activate all autotargeting batteries , " said Nil Spaar . There was a collective gasp from the prisoners on the bridge , who were watching the same display screens as the Yevethan commandos who now occupied their stations . " You \'re all cowards , " Commander Paret called out to the invaders , his voice bitter with contempt and anger . A real soldier would never do this . There \'s no honor in killing the defenseless . " Nil Spaar ignored him . " Lock on targets . " " You vicious , pathetic fool . You \'ve already won . How can you justify this ? " " Fire , " said Nil Spaar . The deck plates barely vibrated as the gun batteries erupted and the approaching transports disappeared in balls of fire and fragments . It did not take long . None escaped .           and panicked inquiries from all over the ship . There had been many witnesses to the carnage . Nil Spaar turned away from the tracking display and crossed the bridge to where Commander Paret lay on the decking . Grabbing the Imperial officer by the hair , he dragged Paret out of line and rolled him over roughly with his booted foot . Seizing the front of Paret \'s tunic with one hand , Nil Spaar lifted him half off the deck . For a long moment he loomed over the officer , looking like a tall , vengeful demon with his colt , black , widely set eyes , the white slash down his nasal ridge , and the deep scarlet-splashed ridges that furrowed his cheeks and chin . Then , hissing , the Yevethan made a fist with his free hand and cocked it back . A sharp , curving dewclaw emerged from the swelling at his wrist . " You are vermin , " Nil Spaar said coldly , and slashed the claw across the Imperial captain \'s throat . Nil Spaar held on through the commander           the floor . Turning , he looked down into the pit at the commando who had taken over the communications station . " Tell the crew that they are the prisoners of the Yevethan Protectorate and His Glory the viceroy , " said Nil Spaar , wiping his claw on the trouser leg of his victim . " Tell them that beginning today , their lives depend on their being useful to us . And then I wish to speak to the viceroy , and tell him of our triumph . " \n The Dream Thief By Shana Abe Random House Shana Abe Darkfrith , Northern England 1768 In the dream , she was always blind . That \'s what would come first , the utter darkness , settling over her like a soft , soft blanket . But it was n\'t a hopeless or desperate kind of blindness . In fact , it always seemed absolutely normal . Because the dream was never about what she could see , but all about what she could hear . " Lia . " " Yes , " she would answer . It was a man speaking to her in the dream . A man \'s voice , one she knew as well as she knew the flow of water over the rocks of her favorite streambed , dark and familiar and smooth . " Lia , " he would say , an imperative . " I \'m here . " " Come to me . " And she would , because in the dream there was nothing she wanted more than to obey that voice . It was her only ambition . " Tell me about today , " the man invited ,           The wheat is hip-high . The Dartmoor ruby has a buyer in Brussels . He wants the emeralds as well . " " Good . " And , oh , how it pleased her , that one single word . How it shimmered through her like warm , sunlit honey , filling her with sweetness . " Where is the marquess ? " the man asked . " Kimber is in the drawing room , awaiting you . " That part was wrong . Even in the dream Lia knew it was wrong , because Kimberwas n\'t the Marquess of Langford yet . Their father was . Kimber was just a boy . But the man never noticed . " And tonight , my heart ? " the man asked , his voice stroking . " Tonight is the Havington dinner party . The viscountess will wear sapphires and silk . " She did not know anyone named Havington . She did not know how she knew about the sapphires , or the silk . But she knew that it was all true . " Which sapphires ? " "           gold , the center stone round , twenty-nine carats , with a spray of opals all around . A bracelet of thirty-five stones : twenty sapphires , fifteen opals . An anklet of eleven sapphires , twenty-one opals " " Very good . That \'s enough . " In the dream , she expanded with that sweetness once more . " What time will the viscountess be removing her jewelry , Lia ? " " Twelve thirty-seven . Eleven minutes after the last guest leaves . The necklace is heavy , " she added . " And you \'re going to have to kill the second footman . He sees you on the way out . " The man said nothing . His presence broke the darkness around her like a prism of pure , humming joy . Like a song . Like a reverie . " Lia . " " Yes ? " " Twelve-thirty is n\'t late . Wait for me in bed . " " Yes , Zane , " she would always answer . And then she \'d wake . *** She was n\'t ready .           though they had waited the requisite fifteen days and sixteen nights for that one perfect June dusk without sun or moon or even stars . The sky above them was smoke and purple-blue , framed by the black cathedral of oaks and willows that made a rough enclosure around their circle of five . Her face was still visible , pale , elfin-sharp , very clear to him even through the fading light . Lia did n\'t share the famous beauty of their sisters , Audrey \'s regal walk or Joan \'s silver-bell laugh . Fourteen years old , both earnest and shy , the essence of Lady Amalia Langford was all contradictions : elbows and a bumpy grace , wheat-gold hair and almond dark eyes , and a face that appeared close to ordinary until she smiled . Even then , she was n\'t beautiful . She was , he considered , trying to be fair . . . arresting . In fact , despite her powerful bloodlines , Lia did n\'t look like anyone else in the tribe . She was all corners and angles , always too           . He \'d been back from Eton only a few days . Kim would have thought that by now his youngest sister would have grown into her heritage , but to him she still seemed like a changeling stuffed into someone else \'s shawl and lacy pink gown . She felt his stare . From her seat on the forest floor her head turned . She met his lookher braids fraying loose from their pins , her cheek smooth with the last glow of twilight , no capthen glanced quickly away . The corners of her lips pulled back into a faint , unhappy line . That was how Kim knew she was n\'t going to finish the ritual . She returned to watching the pair of wrens in the scrolled metal cage near her feet . They fluttered from bar to bar , breathing in small , impassioned notes . It was the only noise that broke the forest silence . There were no crickets sawing . There were no mice or badgers or moles rummaging through the fallen leaves . This was Darkfrith , after all . One           Kim caught the flicker of emotion that crossed Lia \'s face , so fleet he doubted any of the others noticed . But he was the eldest . He \'d had the most experience reading hearts . That flicker had been pain , and sympathy . She \'d always longed for a pet . Hell . She \'d be useless tonight after all . Something dark scored the sky above their heads , something serpentine . None of them bothered to look up . The highest fingers of the oaks shivered in its wake . " Daughter of the tribe , " Kim intoned , going on with it anyway . By God , the carriage ride alone back home had taken over a week ; he was n\'t going to let her off easily . " What dare you offer us ? " But his sister was distracted again . This time her head cocked , her chin lifted , as if she could hear something the others could not . " Lia , " muttered Rhys , the third oldest , from across the circle . " Pay           , daughter of the tribe , " said Lia , her chin lowering obediently , " bring unto you . . . bring unto . . . " The wrens flipped back and forth and back in their prison . " . . . this dire offering , " hissed Joan , prompting . " This dire offering . " " What is the offering ? " Kim asked in his gravest voice , because it was ritual , and because he \'d been practicing that voice for some while . Lia lifted her hand to the cage . The birds pressed back against the far side . " Heart and feathers , " she said , but turned her head againand then broke the circle by climbing to her feet . " Li-a , " said Audrey , exasperated . " Does n\'t anyone hear that ? " " No , " answered Rhys . " And neither do you . Sit down , so we can finish this . It took me a bloody fortnight to catch those wrens . " " Wait , " she said .           It \'s not " Kim began , but then he stopped , because , actually , he heard it too . Not just a carriage , a post chaise , rattling down the graveled drive from the distant manor house . He sent his sister a new , keener glance . " You heard that from here ? It \'s at least a mile away . " Audrey had come to her feet as well , brushing out her skirts . " Who \'s expected ? " " No one . " Rhys shrugged . " Just Zane , and he \'s leaving . " All three sisters swiveled to face him , and in that instant they looked remarkably alike . " What ? " he said , scowling . " Zane ? " echoed Joan . " Zane \'s here ? " " Not any longer . Apparently . " " Why did n\'t you tell us ? " " I beg your pardon . I did n\'t realize I was employed as your majordomo . " Lia dropped her shawl . It slipped to the ground with           brown leaves and dirt . " Hold up . " Kim caught her arm before her third step . " You ca n\'t leave . We \'ve only just begun . " She glanced up at him but it was darker now , so he could n\'t quite read her face . But he was irritated to have come so far for naught ; he tightened his grip and gave her a shake . " Oh , let her be , " said Joan . " She \'s too young for this anyway . We all knew it . " " I did it younger than she , " Kim countered . " Yes , and you had something to prove , did n\'t you ? " This from Audrey , his twin . " Eldest son , future Alpha of the tribe . You wanted to impress us . " She lifted a shoulder , nonchalant . " Do n\'t poker up . I would have done the same if I were you . It was clever to think up a ritual . " Rhys sighed . " Might           \'s gone . They \'re right , you know , she \'s just too young . She \'s always too young . And she has n\'t shown any of the Gifts , anyway . " Beneath his hand , Lia twitched . But Audrey had reminded him of who he was , and who he was someday going to be , and so Kim said , " You know what this means , Amalia . You wo n\'t be one of us , truly one of us , until the ritual is complete . Your Gifts wo n\'t come . Or if they do , they wo n\'t be as good . " " Yes , " she said flatly . " I know . " She shook free of his grip , turned to the birdcage , and snapped open the door . There came a flurry of peeps and rustling ; when she straightened again , there was a dark lump in her fist . " To the drkon , " Amalia said , and broke the wren \'s neck . Her fingers opened . The little bird           angel fan across the tassels . " You have to do both , " managed Rhys , into the sudden hush . Without a word , Lia stuck her hand into the cage and retrieved the other wren . Another rush of invisible wind sliced over them , clattering the leaves . She flung the second bird up after it , where it flapped and fluttered and skimmed off in a drunken line , vanishing into the night . Lia shot a look at Kimber , chin tilted . " I suppose I \'ll only ever be half as good as you , after all , " his little sister said , and with her skirts in her hands she pelted down the path that led back to Chasen Manor . Changeling , Kim thought , watching her go . Definitely . *** Once , years ago , Lia had asked her mother if she heard the song . " The supper chime ? " Rue Langford had asked , tucking her daughter into bed . " No , Mama . The other song . The quiet one . "           father ? " " No . The other song . " And Mama had gazed down at her with her lovely brown eyes , her head tilted , a smile on her lips . She and Papa were hosting a fte that evening for the members of the council and their wives . Her skirts were ivory and cream ; she smelled of flowers and soap and the silvery dust of hair powder . She wore pearls that thrummed with a low , gentle melody , simple , like a hymn . Lia reached out and ran her fingers over the bracelet . " I \'m afraid I do n\'t know what song you mean , beloved . " " That one . . . " Audrey was already out of the nursery , but Joan was in the bed against the other wall , sulking because she was n\'t yet old enough to attend the fte . " She says she hears a song all the time , " said Joan in a very bored , grown-up voice . Mama \'s look sharpened . " What sort of song           . . like the wind in a meadow . Like the ocean . " Rue \'s expression relaxed . " Oh . Yes , I hear that sometimes too . " " You do ? " " I do . Nature plays a wonderful symphony for us . " " No , not nature . It \'s a song . " Rue placed the back of her fingers upon her daughter \'s forehead . Her skin felt very cool . " Can you hum it ? " " No . " " Does it bother you ? Does it hurt your head ? " " No . . . " " It \'s not even real , " said Joan loudly in her bored voice . " If it was real , we \'d all hear it . We can hear everything . " " It is real to your sister , " answered Mama , firm , and looked back at Lia . " You must tell me if it ever starts to fret you . Come to me , and I \'ll fix it . " Lia sat           was powerful , the most powerful female of the tribe , but Lia had no idea her mother \'s Gifts were that strong . " How , Mama ? " " Why , I \'ll love it away , just like this , " said Rue , laughing as she caught Lia by the shoulders and pressed rose-petal kisses all over her cheeks . That was how Amalia knew that her mother did n\'t believe her either . When the dreams began to surface a few years after that , Lia did n\'t bother to tell anyone . The song , for all its persistence , held a certain sadness and distance that made it seem almost innocent . But there was nothing of innocence in the blind dreams . In them she was another person . . . older . Enigmatic . She woke from them flushed and panting , guilty and excited and miserable at once . She would n\'t share those feelings with anyone , not even her mother . At first they were fragments , just voices and sentences that seemed strung together without reason .           she said made no sense . She could hear the man \'s voice , but it was as though he was far away from her , talking through a rainstorm . She caught only snatches of words . Yet the dreams had grown clearer . And clearer . And with them , a rising sense of danger , a warning that pushed down on her chest and prickled the hair on her arms . Nothing truly terrible ever happened in the blind dreams . At the same time , she knew that somehow they meant everything terrible . She spoke of stealing and killing and the loss of her parents as if reciting a list for the village market . It was not pretend . But in that humming , welcome dark , Lia felt nothing wrong at all . A few months past , in the gray morning hours of her fourteenth birthday , the dream had revealed for the first time who the man was . Zane . Zane the Other , Zane the criminal . Zane , former apprentice of the Smoke Thief herself , now the           real world , the world beyond Darkfrith. < Continues ... by Shana Abe Excerpted by permission . \n Things You Should Know A Collection of Stories The Chinese Lesson I am walking , holding a small screen , watching the green dot move like the blip of a plane , the blink of a ship \'s radar .

" You \'re not from around here are you ? " " Not originally , " I say . " But we \'re over on Maple now . " " Tierney , " the man says . " John Tierney . " " Harris , " I say . " Geordie Harris . " " Welcome to the neighborhood . Welcome to town . " He           stopped traveling . " I was hoping to hell that was a toy -- a remote control , " he says . " I was hoping to have some fun . Are you driving a car or floating a boat somewhere around here ? " " It \'s a chip , " I say , cutting him off . " A global positioning screen . I \'m looking for my mother-in-law . " There is a scratching sound from inside a nearby privet , and the unmistakable scent of dog shit rises like smoke . " Good boy , " Tierney says . " He does n\'t like to do his business in public . Ca n\'t blame him -- if they had me shitting outside , I \'d hide in the bushes too . " Tierney -- I hear it like tyranny . Tyrant , teaser , taunting me about my tracking system , my lost mother-in-law . " It \'s not a game , " I say , looking down at the blinking green dot . A yellow Lab pushes out of the bushes and Tierney clips the           , boy , " Tierney says , slapping the side of his leg . " Good luck , " he calls , pulling the dog down the road . The cell phone clipped to my belt rings . " Who was that ? " Susan asks . " Was that someone you know ? " " It was a stranger , a total stranger , looking for a playmate . " I glance down at the screen . " She does n\'t seem to be moving now . " " Is your antenna up ? " Susan asks . There is a pause . I hear her talking to Kate . " See Daddy . See Daddy across the street , wave to Daddy . Kate \'s waving , " she tells me . I stare across the road at the black Volvo idling by the curb . With my free hand I wave back . " That \'s Daddy , " Susan says , handing Kate the phone . " What are you doing , Daddy ? " Kate asks . Her intonation , her annoyance , oddly accusatory           . " " Me too , " Kate giggles . " Give the phone to Mommy . " " I do n\'t think so , " Kate says . " Bye , Kate . " " What \'s new ? " Kate says -- it \'s her latest phrase . " Bye-bye , " I say , hanging up on her . I step off the sidewalk and dart between the houses , through the grass alley that separates one man \'s yard from another \'s . A sneak , a thief , a prowling trespasser , I pull my flashlight out of my jacket and flick it on . The narrow Ever Ready beam catches patios and planters and picnic tables by surprise . I am afraid to call out , to attract attention . Ahead of me there is a basketball court , a slide , a sandbox , and there she is , sailing through my beam like an apparition . Her black hair blowing , her hands smoothly clutching the chain-link ropes of the swing as though they were reins . I catch her in mid-flight           light on her there and gone . " I \'m flying , " she says , sailing through the night . I step in close so that she has to stop swinging . " Did you have a pleasant flight , Mrs. Ha ? " " It was nice . " " Was there a movie ? " She eases herself off the swing and looks at me like I \'m crazy . She looks down at the tracking device . " It \'s no game , " Mrs. Ha says , putting her arm through mine . I lead her back through the woods . " What \'s for dinner , Georgie ? " she says . And I hear the invisible echo of Susan \'s voice correcting -- it \'s not Georgie , it \'s Geordie . " What would you like , Mrs. Ha ? " In the distance , a fat man presses against a sliding glass door , looking out at us , his breath fogging the pane . Susan is at the computer , drawing . She is making a map , a grid           go on in the future -- coordinates . She is an architect , everything is line , everything is order . Our house is G4 . The blue light of the screen pours over her , pressing the flat planes of her face flatter still -- illuminating . She hovers in an eerie blue glow . " I called Ken , " I say . Ken is the one who had the chip put in . He is Susan \'s brother . When Mrs. Ha was sedated for a colonoscopy , Ken had the chip implanted at the bottom of her neck , above her shoulder blades . The chip company specialist came and stood by while a plastic surgeon inserted it just under the skin . Before they let her go home , they tested it by wheeling her gurney all over the hospital while Ken sat in the waiting room tracking her on the small screen . " Why ? " " I called him about her memory . I was wondering if we should increase her medication . " Ken is a psychopharmacologist , a specialist in           stoner and now he is a shrink . He has no affect , no emotions . " And ? " she says . " He asked if she seemed agitated . " " She seems perfectly happy , " Susan says . " I know , " I say , not telling Susan what I told Ken -- Susan is the one who \'s agitated . " Does she know where she is ? " Ken had asked . There had been a pause , a moment where I wondered if he was asking about Susan or his mother . " I \'m not always sure , " I \'d said , failing to differentiate . Things You Should Know \n Through the darkness the man moved from tree to tree , working his way toward the large house . The nineteenth-century estate , forty miles south of Hamburg , Germany , spanned one hundred and twelve acres of beautiful rolling forest and farmland and was designed after the Grand Trianon at Versailles in France . It had been commissioned by Heinrich Hagenmiller in 1872 to win further favor with William I of Prussia , the newly crowned German emperor . Portions of it had been sold off over the years as it became too expensive to maintain so much land . The man walking silently through the woods had already studied hundreds of photographs of the property and its owner . Some of the photos were snapped from satellites orbiting the earth thousands of miles up , but most were taken by the surveillance team that had been in place for the last week . The assassin had arrived from America only this afternoon and wanted to see with his own eyes what he was up against . Photographs were a good start , but they were no substitute for being there in person . The collar of his           ward off the bite of the cold fall evening . The temperature had dropped twenty degrees since sunset . For the second time since leaving the cottage , he stopped dead in his tracks and listened . He thought he had heard something behind him . The narrow path he trod was covered with a fresh bed of golden pine needles . It was a cloudy night , and with the thick canopy above , very little light reached the place where he stood . He moved to the path \'s edge and slowly looked back . Without his night-vision scope , he could see no more than ten feet . Mitch Rapp had been trying not to use the scope . He wanted to make sure he could find his way down the path without it , but something was telling him he was n\'t alone . Rapp extracted a 9-mm Glock automatic from his pocket and quietly screwed a suppresser onto the end of it . Then he grabbed a four-inch tubular pocket scope , flipped the operating switch on , and held it up to his right           a strange green light . Rapp scanned the area , checking not only the path but his flanks . The pocket scope penetrated the dark shadows that his eyes could not . He paid particular attention to the base of the trees that bordered the path . He was looking for the telltale shoe of someone who was seeking to conceal himself . After five minutes of patiently waiting , Rapp began to wonder if it was n\'t a deer or some other creature that had made the noise . After five more minutes , he reluctantly gave in to the conclusion that he had heard an animal of the four-legged variety rather than two- . Rapp put the pocket scope away but decided to keep his gun out . He had not made it to the ripe old age of thirty-two by being careless and sloppy . Like any true professional , he knew when the time was right to take chances and when to cut and run . Rapp continued down the path for another quarter of a mile . He could see the lights of the house           way through the underbrush . Silently , he maneuvered through the thickets , bending branches out of his way and ducking under others . As he approached the edge of the forest , he heard the snap of a twig under his foot and quickly moved to his left , placing a tree directly between himself and the house . A kennel of hunting dogs , not more than a hundred yards away , erupted in alarm . Rapp silently swore at himself and remained perfectly still . This was why he needed to check things out on his own . Amazingly , no one had told him that there were dogs . The canines grew louder , their barks turning to howls , and then a door opened . A deep voice yelled in German for the beasts to be quiet . The man repeated himself two more times , and finally the dogs settled . Rapp slid an eye out from behind the tree and looked at the kennel . The hunting dogs were wired , pacing back and forth . They would be a problem . Not           were still naturally keen . He stood at the edge of the forest listening and watching , taking everything in . He did n\'t like what he saw . There was a lot of open space between the forest and the house . There were some gardens that he could weave his way through , but it would be hard to stay silent on the paths of crushed rock . The dogs would make approaching from the south very difficult . Surveillance cameras covered the other avenues , and there was twice the open space to traverse . The only good news was that there were no pressure pads , microwave beams , or motion sensors to deal with . Officially , Mitch Rapp had nothing to do with the U.S. government . Unofficially , he had been working for the CIA since graduating from Syracuse University more than a decade ago . Rapp had been selected to join a highly secretive counterterrorism group known as the Orion Team . The CIA had honed Rapp \'s raw athleticism and intelligence into a lethal efficiency . The few people he allowed           entrepreneur who had started a small computer consulting business that required frequent travel . To keep things legitimate , Rapp often did conduct business while abroad , but not on this trip . He had been sent to kill a man . A man who had already been warned twice . Rapp studied the area for almost thirty minutes . When he had seen enough , he started back , but not down the path . If someone was in the woods , there was no sense in walking right into a trap . Rapp quietly picked his way through the underbrush for several hundred yards to the south . He stopped three times and checked his compass to make sure he was headed in the right direction . From the intelligence summary , he knew there was another footpath due south of the one he had come in on . Both paths entered the estate from a narrow dirt road and ran roughly parallel to each other . Rapp almost missed the second footpath . It appeared less frequented than the first one and was overgrown . From there           . When he reached it , he knelt down and extracted his pocket scope . For several minutes he scanned the road and listened . When he was sure no one else was about , he began walking south . Rapp had been doing this for almost ten years , and he was ready to get out . In fact , this probably would be his last job . He had met the right woman the previous spring , and it was time to settle down . The CIA did not want to let him go , but that was tough . He had already given enough . Ten years of doing what he did for a living was a lifetime . He was lucky to be getting out in one piece and with a marginally sound mind . A little more than a mile down the road , Rapp came upon a small cottage . The shades were drawn , and smoke drifted from the chimney . He approached the door , knocked twice , paused for a second , and then knocked three more times . It opened           man saw that it was Rapp , he opened the door all the way . Mitch stepped into the sparsely furnished room and began to unbutton his leather jacket . The man who had let him in locked the door behind him . The cottage had knotty pine walls that had been painted white and three-inch plank floorboards that were covered with shiny green paint . Brightly colored oval throw rugs were scattered about the floor , and the furniture was old and solid . The walls were adorned with local folk art and some old black-and-white photographs . Under normal circumstances it would be a great place to spend a cozy fall weekend reading a good book by the fire and taking long walks through the forest . At the kitchen table a woman sat wearing headphones . On the table in front of her was about a quarter of a million dollars in high-tech surveillance equipment . All of the gear was contained in two beat-up black Samsonite suitcases . If anyone were to stop by the cottage , the cases could be closed and moved off the           and woman before . He knew them only as Tom and Jane Hoffman . They were in their mid-forties , and as far as Rapp could tell , they were married . The Hoffmans had stopped in two countries before arriving in Frankfurt . Their tickets had been purchased under assumed names with matching credit cards and passports provided by their contact . They were also given their standard fee of ten thousand dollars for a week \'s work , paid up-front in cash . They were told someone would be joining them and , as always , not to ask any questions . All of their equipment was waiting for them when they arrived at the cottage , and they started right in on the surveillance of the estate and its owner . Several days after arriving at the cottage , they were paid a visit by a man known to them only as the professor . They were given an additional twenty-five thousand dollars and were told they would receive another twenty-five thousand dollars when they completed the mission . He had given them a quick briefing on           not tell them the man \'s real name , only that he was extremely competent . Tom Hoffman poured Rapp a cup of coffee and brought it to him by the roaring fieldstone fireplace . " So , what \'d ya think ? " Rapp shrugged his shoulders and looked at Hoffman \'s face . His complexion was neutral , not flushed like Rapp \'s from being out in the cold night air . In response to the question , he said , " It \'s not going to be easy . " Rapp had already checked the woman \'s face and shoes . Neither of these people had been outside . It must have been a deer that he had heard in the woods . " It rarely is , " noted the stocky Hoffman , who took a drink from his own mug once again while trying to get a read on the stranger before him . The six-foot-one muscular man whom he knew only as Carl moved like a big catsoft on his feet . There was nothing clumsy about him . His face was tanned and           was thick and just starting to gray around the temples , and there was a thin scar on his cheek that ran from his ear down to his jaw . Rapp looked away from Hoffman and into the fire . He knew he was being sized up . Mitch had already done the same with both of them and would continue to do so up until the moment they parted . He looked back into the fire and focused on the plan . He knew the tendency in these situations was to try to come up with something that was truly ingenious -- a plan that would bypass all of the security and get him in and out without being noticed . This was not necessarily a bad path to take if you had enough time to prepare , but as of right now they had about twenty-three hours to draw the whole thing up and pull it off . With that in mind , Rapp had already begun thinking of a strategy . Turning away from the fire , he asked the woman , " Jane , how many           " About fifty . " Rapp ran a hand through his black hair , grabbed the back of his neck , and squeezed . After staring into the fire for a long moment , he announced , " I have an idea . " The first signs of morning were showing in the east . The black sky was turning gray , and patches of fog wafted from ponds as the cool fall air mixed with summer \'s leftover warmth . The pristine Maryland morning was interrupted by a dull thumping noise in the distance . Two Marines walking patrol on the Jeep road by the west fence instinctively searched for the source of the sound . With M-16s slung over their shoulders , they craned their necks skyward , both knowing what was approaching without having to see it . Within seconds they also knew it was n\'t a military bird . The telltale thumping was far too quiet . The white helicopter buzzed in over the trees and headed for the interior of the camp . The Marines followed it for a second and then continued with their           of the president \'s golf partners . The Bell JetRanger continued on an easterly heading toward the camp \'s water tower . Just in front of the tower was a clearing with a cement landing pad . The bird slowed and floated smoothly toward the ground , its struts coming to rest right on the mark . The pilot shut the turbine engine down , and the rotors began to lose momentum . A black Suburban was parked on the nearby road , and several men in dark suits and ties stood by watching as the visitor stepped out of the helicopter . Dr. Irene Kennedy grabbed her briefcase and headed for the truck . Her shoulder-length brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail , and she was wearing a crisp blue shirt . Kennedy clutched the lapels of her tan suit against the cool air . When she reached the Suburban , an army officer extended his hand . " Welcome to Camp David , Dr. Kennedy . " The forty-year-old employee of the Central Intelligence Agency took the officer \'s hand and said , " Thank you           director of the CIA \'s Counterterrorism Center . Unofficially , she headed up the Orion Team , an organization born in secrecy out of a need to go on the offensive against terrorism . In the early eighties the United States was stung hard by a slew of terrorist attacks , most notably the bombing of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut . Despite the millions of dollars and assets allocated to fight terrorism , after the attacks , things only got worse . The decade ended with the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians . The Lockerbie disaster moved some of the most powerful individuals in Washington to take drastic measures . They agreed it was time to take the war to the terrorists . The first option of diplomacy was n\'t doing the job , and the second option of military force was ill suited to fight an enemy that lived and worked among innocent civilians , so America \'s leaders were left with only one choice : the third option . Covert action would be taken .           see the light of day , much less congressional oversight or the scrutiny of the press . A clandestine war would be mounted , and the hunters would become the hunted . The ride took just a few minutes , and no one spoke . When they arrived at Aspen Lodge , Kennedy got out and walked up the porch steps , past two Secret Service agents , and into the president \'s quarters . The colonel escorted Kennedy down the hall to the president \'s study and knocked on the open door frame . " Mr. President , Dr. Kennedy is here . " President Robert Xavier Hayes sat behind his desk sipping a cup of coffee and reading Friday morning \'s edition of the Washington Post . A pair of black-rimmed reading spectacles sat perched on the end of his nose , and when Kennedy entered he looked up from the print and over the top of his cheaters . Hayes immediately closed the paper and said , " Thank you , Colonel . " He then rose from his chair and walked over to a small circular           was dressed for his morning golf match , wearing a pair of khaki pants , a plain blue golf shirt , and a pullover vest . He set his mug down on the table and poured a second cup for Kennedy . After placing it in front of her , he sat and asked , " How is Director Stansfield ? " " He \'s ... " Kennedy grasped to come up with the appropriate word to describe her boss \'s failing health , " as well as could be expected . " Hayes nodded . Thomas Stansfield was a very private man . He had been with the CIA from its very inception , and it appeared he would be with it to the very end of his own life . The seventy-nine-year-old spymaster had just been diagnosed with cancer , and the doctors were giving him less than six months . The president turned his attention to the more immediate matter . " How are things proceeding in Germany ? " " On track . Mitch arrived last night and gave me a full report before I left           on the operation earlier in the week , the one thing Hayes had made crystal-clear was that there would be no green light unless Rapp was involved . The closed meeting between the president and Kennedy was one of many they had had in the last five months , all in an effort to harass , frustrate , destabilize , and , if possible , kill one person . That fortunate individual was Saddam Hussein . Long before President Hayes had taken office , Saddam was a source of irritation to the West , but more recently he had done something that directly affected the fifty-eight-year-old president of the United States . The previous spring , a group of terrorists had attacked the White House and killed dozens of Secret Service agents and several civilians . In the midst of the attack , President Hayes was evacuated to his underground bunker , where he sat for the next three days , cut off from the rest of his government . The siege was ended , thanks to the bold actions of Mitch Rapp and a few select members of the           After the attack the United States was left with two pieces of information that pointed to the Iraqi leader . There was a problem , however , with bringing this information to the United Nations or the international courts . The first piece of evidence was obtained from a foreign intelligence service that was none too eager to have its methods exposed to international scrutiny , and the second was gathered through the use of covert action -- the third option . How that information was extracted would be deemed reprehensible by all but a few . In short , they had some very reliable information that Saddam had funded the terrorists , but they could never make the facts public because that would expose their own methods . And as President Hayes had already noted to an inner circle of advisors , there was no guarantee the UN would do anything once it was confronted with the facts . After intense debate by President Hayes , Director Stansfield of the CIA , and General Flood , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , the three had decided they had           level . At its core , that \'s what this meeting was all about . President Hayes leaned forward and placed his coffee mug on the table . He was eager to hear Rapp \'s take on the situation in Germany . Hayes had discovered that where others failed , Rapp had a way of making things happen . " What does Mitch think ? " " He thinks that given the short notice and the security around the target , we would be better off opting for a more direct approach . " Kennedy went on to give the president a brief overview of the plan . When she was finished Hayes sat back and folded his arms across his chest , his expression thoughtful . Kennedy watched him and kept her own expression neutral , just as her boss would do . Hayes mulled things over for another ten seconds and then said , " What if they did it ... " The president stopped because Kennedy was already shaking her head . " Mitch does n\'t respond well to advice given from three thousand miles away .           the previous spring , Hayes had read up on Rapp . It was almost always his way or the highway , and while this could be a concern , one could hardly argue with the man \'s record of success . He had a history of getting the job done , often when no one else even dared to take it . Hayes suppressed his urge to be an armchair quarterback and instead decided to remind Kennedy of what was at stake . " Do Mitch and the others know they are on their own ? " Kennedy nodded . " I mean really on their own . If anything goes wrong , we will deny any knowledge of the situation and of who they are . We have to . Our relationship with Germany could not withstand something like this , nor , for that matter , could my presidency . " Kennedy nodded understandingly . " Sir , Mitch is good . He \'ll have all of his backups in place by this evening , and if things get too tight , he knows not to force it           and then nodded . " All right . You have my authority to go ahead with this , but you know where we stand , Irene . If it blows up , we never had this meeting , and we did n\'t have the five or six meetings before , either . You had no knowledge of these events , and neither did anyone else at the Agency . " Hayes shook his head . " I hate to do this to Mitch , but there \'s no choice . He is way out there working without a net , and if he falls , we ca n\'t do a thing to help him . " \n Imaginings An Anthology of Long Short Fiction By Keith R. A. DeCandido Pocket Keith R. A. DeCandido Introduction : Novelette , Over Easy Keith R.A. DeCandido Novelette is a really silly word . Ask the average person on the street what a novelette is , and they \'re most likely to say that it \'s a kind of egg dish -- or they \'ll think it \'s a malapropism for novelty . Most people are familiar with the terms novel and short story , but once you get into the more esoteric subcategories like novella and novelette , you are met with looks of abject confusion . However , a novelette is the ideal length for a speculative-fiction story . My personal definition of SF -- which , for the purposes of this discussion , applies to fantasy , science fiction , and certain types of horror -- is that it \'s the world we live in with at least one major change . Sometimes that change is as simple as moving forward or backward in time . Sometimes it \'s that vampires exist . Sometimes it \'s that someone from our world falls down a rabbit hole or           Sometimes it \'s that the Axis won World War II . Sometimes it \'s that the sun is eaten by a giant space goat . Often , it \'s more complex , of course , but what \'s important is that the author has to create a new world -- sometimes several -- or , at least , a new way of looking at this world . To do that , and to also weave atale , sometimes requires a certain amount of storytelling space not provided by the short-story format . After all , SF is the only genre in which the setting is n\'t ( necessarily ) real . SF is also one of the few genres that still has a thriving short-fiction market . It \'s possible to have a writing career in SF that focuses primarily on less-than-novel-length works ( indeed , some of the authors in this volume have such careers ) . Unfortunately , most short-fiction markets , limited as they are by space , the rising costs of paper , and the desire to include as much as possible , prefer the traditional           to those silly-sounding novelettes , which are about 8000-15,000 words , or to 15,000-40,000-word novellas . Such longer works still do get published , of course , but in much smaller numbers . A pity , that , as some of the most influential and important stories in the field are novelette length : " The Bicentennial Man " by Isaac Asimov , " Blood Music " by Greg Bear , " Tower of Babylon " by Ted Chiang , " Buffalo Gals , Wo n\'t You Come Out Tonight " by Ursula K. Le Guin , " Sandkings " by George R.R. Martin , " The Screwfly Solution " by Raccoona Sheldon ( better known under her other pseudonym , James Tiptree , Jr . ) , " Slow Sculpture " by Theodore Sturgeon , and so many more . The book you hold in your hands is an attempt to provide a new source for these novelettes . It all started in Framingham , Massachusetts . It was Boskone , 1999 . Boskone is a science-fiction convention that has been held in or near Boston for over four           on anthologies . Also present -- either on the panel or in the audience -- were Patrick Nielsen Hayden , Kathryn Cramer , Esther M. Freisner , and David G. Hartwell , all experienced anthologists . We got to discussing Patrick \'s Starlight series of original anthologies , and how it was a return to the old-fashioned anthology , la Terry Carr \'s Universe series , where the only requisite was that a story be a good example of the genre , as opposed to the " theme " anthologies that proliferate these days ( hell , I \'ve edited a whole bunch of them ) . Kathryn made a comment that there needed to be more books like that . And I said to myself , " Self , " I said , " you should do that . " The catch was trying to make mine unique , and it did n\'t take long to hit on how to do that : length . I would do an anthology that would be home to the best new novelettes ( silly word notwithstanding ) in the genre . As           -- which was a totally open call , with no preselected stories or guaranteed spots -- were that the story be in the science-fiction or fantasy genre ( or horror , but only if the story contained SF elements ) , and that it be between 8000 and 15,000 words in length . I received approximately 450 submissions over nine and a half months , and somehow managed to whittle it down to the ten in this volume . It was n\'t easy -- I could have filled two more volumes with excellent stories that I ultimately passed on . But in the end , I think we have the cream of the crop . The quality of the submissions certainly , to my mind , proved the ideal-length thesis to be corrrect . What \'s more , we have variety . Within these pages are hard-science stories , fantasies , horror stories , superhero stories , funny stories , speculative stories , stories that could n\'t have been written before the turn of the twenty-first century , stories that could just as easily have been written in the mid-twentieth           from relative unknowns . They have only this in common : they show us the world we know , but with at least one important thing changed , and they are quality tales . Well , at least I think so . I hope you feel likewise .

DeCandido \n Chapter One New Year \'s Eve 1999 , New York City Jeff Across the dance floor , some guy \'s squirting Windex in his mouth . " Now I \'ve seen everything , " Henry says , all eyes and attitude . I just shake my head . " Believe me , Henry . You have not seen everything . " For here on the dance floor , nothing quite makes sense in the way it does in the world beyond . Here the ludicrous becomes the sublime . Dress in spandex and sequins and funny little hats . Ingest substances not intended for human consumption . Stick your tongue down the throat of a beautiful stranger . Take off your pants and dance in your underwear . That \'s just the way things are . " Still , " Henry \'s sputtering , shaking his head , " the things some people will do for a fucking high . I mean , Windex- " " Henry . " I place my palms against his sweaty chest and press my face close to his . Eyes to eyes , nose to nose . " No talking on the dance           knows it , even if he conveniently forgets it whenever he want to start gabbing . Henry \'s one of the chatty types . You know the kind I mean . The ones who insist on telling you , right in the middle of an awesome Rosabel club anthem remix , all about their new job or the size of the penis on their last trick or-worst of all-how tonight \'s DJ just really sucks : " Can you believe how he \'s mixing in all this trancey stuff with all this high-energy disco diva blah blah blah blah blah . " Dancer ! We \'re here to dance ! That \'s why I come , anyway : to escape , to forget , to get swallowed up by a moist cocoon of four hundred men with the music spinning me higher and higher until it \'s taken control , slipping past my defenses like the fingers of a stranger trespassing beneath the waistband of my underwear . That happens , too . One more example of the way things are . " Oh , shit , Jeff , "           I roll my eyes . " Who ? " " The Windex queen ! " A few feet away , to the giddy disgust of the boys around him , the tall blond guy is pumping the bright-blue liquid down his throat . But his eyes have locked onto Henry \'s , and he \'s now sidling our way , his lanky body easily angling around the huddles of boyflesh . " Jeff , you \'ve got ta hide me ! " Henry yelps . I just laugh . " Did n\'t I teach you to fight your own battles , buddy ? " " How you boys doin \' tonight ? " the Windex queen purrs , holding aloft his bottle like a prize . " Wanta get really twisted ? " I give the guy the once-over . A dyed blond , skinny and shapeless , with tiny little buds for nipples , one of which is pierced with a small gold ring . " Thanks , " I tell him , " but we \'re as twisted as we want to be . " " You boys           moving on to his next victims . Henry leans into me and breathes a sigh of relief . " Do you think that really is Windex ? " " Henry , " I remind him , " no talking on the dance floor . " Okay . So maybe you think I \'m coming across a little overweening here . I do n\'t mean to be . Really , I do n\'t . Oh , I \'m sure in the course of this you \'re going to hear people say that I \'m self-absorbed , arrogant , selfish . They said it last time , they \'ll say it again . But it \'s just that I \'ve come here to dance , to close out the rest of the world for a night , to forget what I want so much to forget . Is that so wrong ? So much to ask ? I have no patience for dance floor vaudeville . And maybe tonight I \'m a little more impatient that usual . You see , it \'s getting close to midnight , and Lloyd still has           voice again , Jeff , " Henry says , drawing close . " But are you starting to think that Lloyd is n\'t coming ? " " He \'s still got time , " I insist . Henry snorts . " And you \'re still convinced he \'s going to tell you he wants to move back in with you ? " Here \'s something you need to know about Henry : he \'s my best friend and I love him and he \'s terrific and all that , but he can be a total nag . I think somewhere down deep , Henry would like us to be more than just friends , and the idea of my ex-lover and me moving back in together probably unnerves him a little bit . So I just smile . " Well , we \'ll just have to wait and see , " I suggest sweetly , " wo n\'t we , Henry ? " He just smirks and goes silent . Finally . We both fall into the music . It \'s awesome tonight , being New Year \'s and all           . I reach over and run my hands down Henry \'s torso , tweaking his nipples as I pass . He opens his eyes . " Just because you \'re rolling , Jeff O\'Brien , is no excuse to hit on your sister . " I pull in close . " You know you want me , " I tease . Henry pushes me away . " What I want , " he insists , " is to be in Miami . Brent is in Miami , and you can be sure he \'ll tell us all about it . " Okay , a few more notes on Henry . I created this monster . Yes , I admit it . I take full responsibility for what he \'s become . Henry Weiner was once a good boy who never had more than a couple of Heinekens at happy hour , whose idea of a big Saturday night out was watching retro Cyndi Lauper videos at Luxor with a couple of pals until midnight . He was one of those nameless , faceless guys you see on the sidelines of           pass them by . He was a 120-pound insurance-company geek on the fast track to corporate paralysis when I met him , enticing him to take off his shirt and step into the limelight . I \'ll never forget the look of sheer wonderment on his face as he slipped in between Brent Whitehead and me on the dance floor . Now Henry weighs in at 185 , has a hard-won six-pack of abs and a star-burst tattoo around his navel . Now it \'s very important to Henry to keep pace with the other boys-especially Brent , circuit boy extraordinaire , who makes sure he \'s at every important party around the nation and whose primary goal in life is to get a photo of his sweaty torso into the pages of Circuit Noize magazine . I look over at Henry with mock sympathy . " Now , now , buddy , we were just in Miami last month for the White Party . Let \'s not become complete stereotypes , shall we ? " He sniffs . " All I know is , it \'s warm in Miami           tonight . " " Hey , you \'re the one that nixed the cab . " He shakes his finger at me . Literally . Like some old schoolmarm . " And well I did . After paying a hundred bucks to get in here tonight-not to mention what I had to fork over for the X-I was n\'t paying out any more cash than I had to . " I lace my fingers behind Henry \'s back and pull him close , crotch to crotch . " So what happened to it ? " I purr into his ear . " Ecstasy is supposed to give you a love for all mankind . " Henry smiles . Our faces are close enough that I can smell the Altoid in his mouth . In moments like these I can tell he wants to kiss me . Or me to kiss him . I can feel my dick swell against him despite myself . " I \'m just not independently wealthy like you , " Henry needles . " And besides , it \'s the millennium , Jeff . I \'m           century turned over into the twenty-first-and here I am , in New York of all places , where I could be any time , any year , any century . " He pouts . " And Victor Calderone is spinning in Miami . You love Victor Calderone , Jeff . " " Junior \'s doing a fine job here . " Henry smirks . " So long as the power does n\'t shut off at midnight . " " Oh , do n\'t start with the Y2K stuff . " I hold my hands up . " How many gallons of water did you stockpile again ? " He ignores me . " At least in Miami we would n\'t freeze without power . " " Henry . " I narrow my eyes at him . " Read my lips . Ix-nay on the dance floor talk . " I grab him around the waist just as Junior mixes in " Unspeakable Joy " by Kim English . Henry smiles nastily . " You know , maybe Lloyd got stuck in the thirteenth century and ca n\'t make it back           , Henry . " Okay , time for a little more background . Lloyd-the guy I \'m waiting for-the guy with whom I \'ve spent the last eleven years of my life in a crazy back-and-forth pas de deux-had a first stop to make this evening before winding up here at Twilo . It was a past-life regression gathering at some lady \'s house on the Upper West Side . Now , I can make fun of Lloyd \'s New Agey-ness , but I will not tolerate others doing the same thing . Not even Henry . " I \'m not being- " Henry suddenly stops . " Oh , God , Jeff . He \'s coming back . " Two things at once : on my right , I spot the Windex queen approaching again , a tall flurry of arms with a mischievous gleam in his eyes , and on my left , beyond the perimeter of the dance floor , I catch a sudden flash of goatee and one well-rounded shoulder . Lloyd . He \'s quickly obscured again by the throng of manflesh , but I           " the Windex queen is saying . " Just one little baby squirt ? " I watch as the freak show pumps a dollop of the blue stuff into his mouth and swallows it , licking his lips . Henry makes a face in horror . " Girl , " I say , tapping a finger against his sticky , sinewy chest , " if you \'re drinking Windex , then I \'m a straight boy from Jersey City . " At that moment , the crowd parts , not unlike the Red Sea , in fact , and I spot him again . Lloyd . Our eyes connect . He waves when he sees me . God , how beautiful he looks . I quickly slip around the Windex queen to push into the throng of flesh . " What \'s the matter ? " the guy asks , mock-innocently . " Was it something I did ? " Henry frowns . " It \'s not you , " he says , raising his voice so I can hear . " It \'s his ex-lover , with whom he           fade out together behind the end credits and live happily ever after . " So let Henry be snide and sarcastic . That \'s what sisters do best , is n\'t it ? Well , screw him . I \'m not sure I still believe in happy ever-afters , given everything that \'s happened in the last five years , but right now , spotting Lloyd across the dance floor , all that matters is that he \'s here . Lloyd Even before I see him fully , I know it \'s Jeff . That \'s just the way it is with us . We have this uncanny way of finding each other , of connecting across great distances . Even during the time we were apart , if I would have a dream about him one night , he was sure to call the next morning . Do n\'t laugh . I believe in such things as psychic connections , soul mates , partners with whom you travel from life to life . How else to explain Jeff and me ? It \'s not as if we \'re much           and sweat and stink and drugs . So call it whatever you want , but there is something bigger than the two of us that keeps us together . There has to be . " Hey ! " Jeff pushes his way out of the snake pit of the dance floor . I ca n\'t help laughing at the image . " You look like one of those devil kids emerging from the cornfield . " Jeff \'s eyes widen and he raises his arms like a monster . " The Cheeldren of the Corn , " he intones ominously , then breaks into a broad grin . We both laugh and fall into each other \'s arms . It \'s one of our favorite bad movies , watched on a rainy day in Provincetown , a pan of brownies rapidly disappearing between us . We kiss . Lots of tongue and lips . I determine pretty quickly that Jeff is on X. His torso is sticky and wet . I \'m shiftless , too , having adhered to the unwritten but widely observed policy of shirt removal moments after           has already been here for a while , slipping and sliding across countless boys on the dance floor-I have yet to break into a sweat . " You look great , Cat , " I tell him . And he does-better all the time , it seems . Jeff \'s always been good-looking-dark hair , classic features-but now he \'s bigger , broader , more cut . He \'s spent a lot of time at the gym over the past several years . And why not ? He \'s had nothing else to do and has n\'t needed to worry about money the way he used to . Besides , I think the gym , like his clubbing , is a way for him to escape . To forget . Jeff spends a lot of energy forgetting . " You , too , Dog , " he tells me . " You look great , too . " We kiss again . Our old nicknames flow easily . In fact , everything \'s been surprisingly easy these past few months , almost impossibly so . We stand there pec to           other \'s waists . We \'re the same height , so we \'re able to stare into each other \'s eyes until we both , at the same time , let loose with a grin . That \'s been happening a lot : whenever we look into each other \'s eyes for any length of time , we just ca n\'t hold back the smile . " I \'m really glad you got here before midnight , " Jeff says softly , holding my face in his hands . I wink at him . " With twenty minutes to spare , too . " " I never doubted you for an instant . " Okay , so he probably did , but it \'s sweet of him to pretend . He kisses me passionately for a moment , then pulls back to gaze into my eyes again . I smile wryly . " How much X did you do , Jeff ? " " Just one bump . " He gets edgy , a little defensive-not what I want or what I intended . " You said you trusted me           " I nod . " I know , Jeff . I just worry that a little X- " " Can lead to more ? Please , Lloyd . " He kisses me . " I \'m okay . Just expressive . You said I needed to be more expressive . " A point of order here : Jeff was once very expressive about things , without the need of any drug . I remember , when we lived together we \'d have fights about the laundry , in which he \'d kick the basket of clothes all the way down the stairs . Once , fed up with bill collectors , he tossed a ceramic dog his grandmother had given him across the room , where it shattered into a dozen pieces and left him heartbroken . I then painstakingly glued it back together for him as best I could . Jeff never used drugs in those days . The emotion was real , heartfelt . The old Jeff used to cry over episodes of Laverne and Shirley-whenever Laverne would realize what a schmuck she \'d been and how happy           in Milwaukee , and then the two of them would start singing " High Hopes " as the camera panned up and out through the window . Jeff would be over there blubbering on the couch , and I was never quite sure if I wanted to laugh or cry along with him . Then things happened . All the stuff he \'s been trying so hard to forget . He started doing drugs-and the nasty ones : crystal and GHB-and he shut down , reined in all those emotions . I hardly knew him . The Jeff I \'d lived with for six years had n\'t been afraid to let his feelings show . He might not have always known what they meant , but he let them flow . Continues ... \n Chapter One On her way to bed , Lucinda stopped in the living room doorway to look at the black-and-white pinspot-lit photographs of her mother and father on the far wall . Lily \'s was the famous 1957 Hurrell portrait , with his signature exquisite lighting and airbrush work . Simply made up ( Lily had refused the usual false eyelashes , heavy penciled-in brows and overdrawn mouth ) , her deep-set , clear blue eyes looked directly into the lens as if offering a somewhat amused challenge . Her normally limp , naturally blonde hair gleamed in an elaborate upsweep that accentuated the length and vulnerability of her exposed throat , and her famous cleavage was on display courtesy of a tastefully lowcut , long-sleeved black moir silk dress . No one would have known , from that photograph , how thin and tiny a woman she actually was , and how very unprepossessing in real life . Beside it , in a matching frame , was the blown-up late-40s studio photograph of her father , Adam Bentley Franklin . In his pristine white dress uniform , rows of ribbons on his chest , spine perfectly straight ,           to show the appealing dimple in his left cheek - a man of evident good humor , despite the formality of the pose . He had the same hazel eyes as Lucinda \'s , the same mouth and cheekbones , the same high forehead and slightly squared jaw . But unlike her hair which was dark blonde , his was black , with the standard military short-back-and-sides cut . And unlike her complexion , which was pale like Lily \'s , her father \'s was dusky . The first time she \'d come to visit after Lucinda had hung the photographs , her grandmother , Elise , stopped in the doorway , her hand lifting to her heart , and said a little breathlessly , " Oh , but this is wonderful ! How lovely they were , eh , chrie ? " Lucinda was perpetually awed at her parents being side by side , together for anyone to see - something they \'d done in reality only a few times during their lives . Public or studio knowledge of her having a husband of color would have put an           nor Adam had been willing to risk that . Nor had they wished to risk stigmatizing Lucinda \'s life . So they \'d gone to great lengths to ensure that their child would n\'t know the true facts of her parentage . Lily always said , " I \'ve got no idea who your father was . Okay ? It could \'ve been a couple of different guys . What \'s it matter anyway ? I did right by you , did n\'t I ? " True . She \'d done better than all right . She \'d been a wonderful mother - easygoing and proud of her daughter \'s slightest accomplishment . It was just that she \'d had a big secret she \'d gone to extraordinary lengths to keep . There had been no other men . Only the one . And his identity had died with her , leaving Lucinda to search every avenue , using every conceivable resource , until all the possibilities had been exhausted . It would n\'t have mattered , Lily , she silently told her mother \'s portrait , as she often           , spending time with them , instead of losing years , decades , to a paralyzing uncertainty that had , like a bizarre life-support system , kept her breathing but not truly alive . Lucinda stood enjoying the fragrant breeze and the early summer sun piercing the heavy foliage to lay splashes of warmth on her arms . Everything was in bloom and the colors were , she thought , like the primaries of a beginner \'s set of Crayolas . She loved spring . But full summer , when the air stood motionless and heavy , too thick almost to breathe , was unbearable . Despite having spent the first part of her life in California - the land of perpetual summer with the periodic peculiar effects of the Santa Anas that often drove otherwise rational people to do irrational things - she \'d never tolerated the heat well . Lily had n\'t either , and used to say she \'d passed her native New England genes to Lucinda . Which was why Lily \'s first major expenditure on the Connecticut house had been the central heating/ air-conditioning system           the installation of the swimming pool for Lucinda ( Lily herself did n\'t swim ) . And that was that . Lily \'s taste in furnishings had been terrible . Lucinda had grown up with a woman who , while meticulous in most other areas , had been content to live with furniture the Salvation Army would \'ve rejected . Nearly thirty years before , when Lily \'s estate finally cleared probate , Lucinda had become the owner of a property that included the old farmhouse and barn on two acres of land ( which had the local real estate agents salivating and phoning endlessly , begging her to sell ) , more money than she could possibly spend ( given her limited needs and desires ) , and a number of cartons of highly collectible memorabilia from her mother \'s film career . By then , though , Lucinda was in a state perilously close to agoraphobia . With a desperate need to humanize the space that had come to contain her as tightly as a vacuum-sealed , see-through package , she had had the house renovated . But           farm implements , dead lawn mowers and crumbling wicker furniture ; the home of nesting birds and small burrowing animals . At last , in the grip of long-accumulated inspiration , she \'d hired an architect - a then-recent graduate whose tidy features flushed with ambitious pleasure at the sight of the massive hand-hewn beams and weathered wood walls . And the previous May the renovation of the barn had finally been completed after thirteen months of noisy saws , migraine-inducing hammering , and workmen moving about to the accompaniment of bad music blaring from the paint-bespattered boombox that seemed to be a vital part of their equipment . ( Continues ... ) \n Chapter One The swim party seemed like a great idea , the perfect ending to a perfect summer . Brooke Baxter West \'s partner at the pediatric office had a daughter Maddie \'s age , and to celebrate her birthday , the family had invited ten kids and their parents for an afternoon in their backyard pool . For two weeks the girls had talked about it nonstop , seeking out Brooke each morning and tugging on her arm . " Mommy , when \'s the swim party ? " But two days before the big event , another doctor at the office had received word from California that his aging grandmother had only days to live . Before he caught an emergency flight , he \'d asked Brooke if she \'d take his on-call duty for the weekend . " You \'re my last hope , " he told her . " My family needs me . " Brooke hated being on call when she had plans to spend an afternoon with her girls . But other than the swim party , the weekend was open , and she could take the pager with her . The chances           Saturday evening , yes . But not Saturday afternoon . Now the big day was here , and Brooke was having doubts . She should \'ve called around , found someone else to take the doctor \'s on-call duty . Her kids wanted her at the party , and if a call came in , she \'d miss the summer \'s last hurrah . Brooke slipped a pair of shorts on over her swimsuit . She was raising the zipper when she heard Peter \'s voice downstairs . " Hurry up , let \'s go . " Frustration rang in his voice . " The party starts in ten minutes . " Brooke rolled her eyes and grabbed her bag-the one with the life jackets and sunscreen . What was wrong with him ? He was constantly grouchy ; the two of them had n\'t had a normal conversation in weeks . Their home was so tense even little Hayley had noticed it . " Is Daddy mad at you , Mommy ? " she \'d asked earlier that week . Brooke had mumbled something about Daddy being tired ,           But after days of sidestepping him , she was sick of Peter \'s attitude . He made her feel incompetent and irritating . The same way he \'d made her feel ever since Maddie \'s diagnosis . Did n\'t he get it ? Maddie was better now ; no fevers for more than two months . Brooke headed into the hallway and ran into Hayley and Maddie . " Guess what , girls ? " A glance at the grins on her daughters \' faces and her smile came easily . " I \'m wearing my swimsuit ! " " Goodie , Mommy . " Maddie jumped up and down and reached for Hayley \'s hand . " We can play tea party on the steps . " They joined Peter downstairs and but for the girls \' excited chatter , they rode in silence to the house across town where Brooke \'s partner , Aletha , and her husband , DeWayne , lived . At three years old , Hayley was still small enough to carry , so Brooke swept her into her arms as they headed up the           the steps , Hayley took hold of Brooke \'s hand and squeezed it three times . The sign Brooke used with the girls to say , " I love you . " The love from her younger daughter was the perfect remedy for Peter \'s coolness . " You \'re a sweet girl , Hayley ; do you know that ? " She shifted her pool bag to her shoulder . " You , too , Mommy . " Hayley rubbed her tiny nose against Brooke \'s . " You \'re a sweetie girl , too . Know why ? " " Why ? " Brooke and Hayley trailed behind , and Brooke took her time . She loved moments like this with her girls . " Because- " Hayley tilted her head , her pale blonde hair falling like silk around her wide-eyed face- " I love you , that \'s why . " The door opened and Aletha smiled at them from the front step . " Hi . The party \'s out back . " Peter pulled out a smile , the one he wielded whenever they           hurt . Why could n\'t he smile that way at her ? She \'d been meaning to ask him , but she had n\'t found the chance . She was a few feet from the front door when her pager went off . She exhaled hard as she unclipped the pager from her waistband and stared at the small message window . Urgent , it read . The word was followed by the hospital \'s main number . Great , she thought . I wo n\'t get even an hour with them in the pool . Peter came up behind her and looked over her shoulder . " What is it ? " " A hospital call . " She did n\'t hide the disappointment in her voice . " Maybe it \'s nothing . " Several children , breathless and excited , ran into the foyer and surrounded Hayley and Maddie . Brooke ducked into the nearest bedroom and pulled her cell phone from her purse . " Dr. Brooke Baxter West here . Someone paged me . " The nurse on the other end rattled off the information           admitted with a staph infection . It looked serious . They wanted a pediatrician to consult . Immediately . " I \'m on my way . " Brooke hung up the phone and returned to the foyer . Peter caught her look and raised his eyebrows . " Well ? " " I have to go . " She pursed her lips . Doctoring was the most exhilarating career she could imagine having . But not when it interfered with her family . " I \'ll be back as quick as I can . " " It \'s your own fault . " A ribbon of anger wrapped itself around her heart . " What \'s that supposed to mean ? " Peter shrugged , his eyes distant . " You took the on-call . " Maddie ran up to her . " Natasha wants us to swim , Mommy . Can we , please ? Can we right now ? " " Um , baby- " she looked at Hayley standing a foot away , waiting for her answer- " why do n\'t you wait till Mommy comes back           Please , Mommy ? Can we ? " Natasha did a little dance nearby and hugged Brooke . Their families had been friends for years , and Maddie and Natasha were best buddies . " Please , can we swim ? " Natasha linked arms with Maddie and the two smiled their best smiles . Brooke could feel the fight leaving her . So she \'d miss out on some of the fun . If she hurried , she \'d be back in time to join them in the pool . " Okay . " She allowed a slight smile . " But let me talk to Daddy first . " Peter had moved into the living room , and Brooke found him and DeWayne seated side by side , their eyes glued to the television . A baseball playoff game was on , and Aletha had joked that having the party at that time could mean the men might never leave the TV . Brooke crossed the room and positioned herself between her husband and the big screen . " The girls want to swim . " The bag           on the floor between them . " Here \'s the sunscreen and life jackets . The girls need both before they can go out back . " " Right . " Peter leaned sideways so he could see the game . " I got it , honey . " The term of endearment was for DeWayne \'s benefit , Brooke was sure . She did n\'t appreciate the way he looked past her to the game . " Peter , I \'m serious . Do n\'t let them outside without sunscreen and a life jacket . They \'re not pool safe . " He shot her a look , one that said she was embarrassing him . Then he yelled out , " Hayley ... Maddie , come here . " The girls scampered into the room and came up close to Peter . " Yes , Daddy . " Hayley spoke first . " Can we swim ? " " Not yet . " Peter looked hard at Brooke and unzipped the bag . Quickly and with little finesse , he lathered sunscreen into his hand and then tossed           She needed to leave , but this was more important . Moving as fast as she could , she squeezed the lotion into her hand and positioned herself in front of their little blonde daughter . " Here , sweetie . We do n\'t want a sunburn , right ? " " Right , Mommy . " Brooke rubbed the sunscreen over Hayley \'s arms and legs , her back and neck , and finally her face . She and Peter finished with the girls at the same time , and Peter tossed her the smaller life jacket . He said nothing as they worked , and that was fine with Brooke . These days , the less he said the better . She took the blue-and-aqua life jacket and slipped first one of Hayley \'s arms , then the other , through the holes . Next she latched the buckles down the front and attached a strap that ran from the back of the vest , between her legs , to the front . Brooke had researched life jackets , and this style was the safest of all .           one last glare . Again because of DeWayne seated beside him , he kept his tone light , almost friendly . " There you go . See you later . " Brooke said nothing . Instead she turned and bid the girls a quick good-bye . She found Aletha and promised to be back as soon as possible . A minute later she was in the car , doing a U-turn toward the hospital . With every mile she felt the distance between herself and her daughters . They were playing in the pool by now , getting used to the water , their little-girl laughter ringing across Aletha \'s backyard . She stepped on the gas . She \'d make this the quickest call ever and be back before the underwater tea party even began . Then-other than her relationship with Peter-everything about the day would play out just like it was supposed to . * * * Peter was grateful for the National League Championship Series on TV . Because as much as he liked DeWayne and Aletha , the last thing he wanted was to spend that           his thing , and the current series was easily one of the most exciting ever . Besides , most of the guests were Brooke \'s friends , people he barely knew . The prospect of catching a game with DeWayne had swayed him to come . Especially after Brooke took the on-call assignment . What had she been thinking ? Of course she \'d get called Saturday afternoon ; kids needed doctors then most of all . Soccer injuries , illnesses that had brewed all week at school . Insect bites . Weekends were notoriously busy for pediatricians . The fact that she \'d let the other doctor talk her into taking his on-call was further proof that she was n\'t capable . Not nearly as capable as he \'d originally thought her to be . Back when they \'d met in med school , her confidence and competence had been part of what attracted him to her . But after the situation with Maddie-when she \'d insisted that their daughter did n\'t need a specialist-Peter had seen his wife in a new light . One that was far from           children came from the other room . " Okay , " he heard Aletha tell them . " Dry off , and we \'ll have cake . " It was the seventh inning , and his team was down by one . Peter hoped they could keep the cake thing quiet-at least until the commercial . Not that he did n\'t like birthdays , but he \'d had one of the longest weeks in his life . His patients had needed him more than usual , he \'d gone without sleep for two days , and now-on his day off-he was spending his Saturday at a kid \'s birthday party . At that instant-with the tying run on third and a power hitter at the plate-Maddie and Hayley ran into the room . They were shivering , and their life jackets made a trail of dripping water . " Daddy , can you take off our jackets ? " He glanced at them and then back at the TV . " Just a minute , girls . Daddy wants to see this . " The count was 3-0 , but           and connected , but the ball flew over the catcher and into the stands . Foul tip . Strike one . " Okay . " Peter looked at his daughters again . " Now what ? " " We \'re dripping , Daddy . " Maddie took a step forward . " Can you take off our jackets ? Please ? " " Sure , pumpkin . " He unsnapped the buckles on both vests and helped take them off . " Give them to Natasha \'s mommy and ask her to hang them near the bathtub . " The next pitch was a perfect strike , one that caught the hitter looking . Full count . " Daddy ... " Hayley stepped up . " When \'s Mommy coming back ? We \'re a\'posed to have a tea party with her in the pool . " " Soon , baby . " He leaned around her and watched the man at bat belt one out of the park . The moment it was gone , he and DeWayne stood up and slapped their hands in a high five .           life . " DeWayne gave a few nods and sat back down . " On their way , baby . On their way . " " Daddy ... " Hayley angled her head . " I love you . " " Right . " Peter eased himself back to his seat . His eyes returned to the game . " Love you , too . " " Bye . " Maddie turned and dashed from the room , her life jacket slung over her arm . " Bye , Daddy . " Hayley was close on her sister \'s heels . " Bye . " Peter studied the screen and then remembered something . " Do n\'t go outside without those life jackets . " But the girls were already out of the room . He stared after his girls , and even with the noise from the game he could almost hear Brooke telling him to find them , make sure they understood about the life jackets . But the game was almost over , and anyway , the kids were about to eat cake . He could remind           mind cleared , and all his attention centered once more on the game . A single and a stolen base , another single and a sacrifice fly . Two-run lead . If they won this game they \'d take a three-two lead and the series would be as good as over . Instead , the pitcher struck out the next two batters , and in the following inning the other team scored two runs to tie it up . Not until the bottom of the ninth inning did his team score the winning run . The game ended , the win forever in the books , and Peter was thirty minutes into a discussion on the merits of switch-hitting and relief pitching when he heard Maddie call him from the other room . " Daddy ! Daddy , quick ! Help ! " He held up his hand to DeWayne . " Just a minute . " He raised his voice . " In here , baby . " Maddie tore around the corner . Her hair was dry , her eyes round with fear . " Daddy , I           feet , his heart suddenly in his throat . " What do you mean ? " Fear dug its talons into his back , his neck . It was all he could do to keep from sprinting toward the backyard . " I thought you were eating cake . " " We did . Then we \' cided to go swimming , Daddy . " Maddie \'s mouth hung open . " But Hayley said she wanted to be first to get the tea party ready for Mommy . Now I ca n\'t find her- " Peter did n\'t wait for Maddie to finish . He took off for the patio door , not so much because of what Maddie had said but because of the thing she was holding in her hands . The thing Peter had only that instant recognized . Hayley \'s life jacket . ( Continues ... ) \n i Unbuttoning Lady X Delhi is a city where things happen undercover .

My knowledge of the facts of life was based entirely on books , and clean ones at that . I read nineteenth-century classics by George Eliot and Emily Bront . These books never went into any details . To remedy this I decided to read Vatsyayana \'s Kamasutra . I had to           had been converted into a storeroom . I would sneak out with a flashlight after my parents had gone to sleep . The Kamasutra that I force-fed myself seemed completely of another world , alien and absurd . After I read it , however , magical things started to happen . In particular , I met a woman . We first met in my school . She had come to attend the parent-teacher meeting . I was the Head Prefect . " Where are the teachers for Class I ? " she asked . " In the Pushkin Block , ma\'am , " I replied . I was susceptible at that age . I had been reading The Citadel by A. J. Cronin , in which themain female character was described as particularly handsome . I fancied for a moment that she was that handsome woman . " I \'ll take you there , ma\'am , " I offered . " What \'s your name ? " " Anamika , " I replied . " I like your tie , " she said . " Oh . " I tugged           suddenly conscious of the ridiculous figure I must cut in my school uniform of red socks and shirtsleeves . Like most schools , mine had a strict dress code . The girls wore gray box-pleated skirts . Boys up to the age of fourteen wore knickers . Everyone wore a striped red and silver tie except for the Prefects . We wore a silver and blue one . I hated the ageism of Delhi and its antediluvian norms , which required you to address anyone older as Uncleji or Auntyji and anyone younger with diminutives . It precluded serious bonding with people older than you . I did not have the courage to ask this woman her name . She was of another generation ; that sort of thing was just not done . After I left her in front of the Pushkin Block , I felt my heart overflow with some kind of knowledge I could not immediately identify . I had imagined so many times how Newton must have felt when the apple dropped on his head and the weight of gravitational forces clicked into place . I           had just been made and all I had to do was write down its formula . I wished a simple object like an apple had been involved , something tangible that I could contemplate and hold , smell and bite . I felt the urge to call her something . Something that no one else was called . A word that was not a name and that was still proportional to the immensity of the revelation unfolding within me . " India " was the first thing that slipped silently from my lips . I hung around that part of campus so I could catch her on the way out . Eventually she emerged from the same doors that had earlier swallowed her . I pretended to look elsewhere . She came up behind me and tapped my shoulder . " Do you like this school ? I am thinking of putting my son in it , " she said . " Yes . Extracurricular activities are encouraged . We have horse riding . " " Do you know how to ride ? " " Yes , I \'ve done           wanted to ride horses . But with so many extracurriculars , will you still do well on the board exams ? " she asked . " I probably will . I love to study . " " You \'ll do well no matter . You are obviously exceptional . " She looked at the Head Prefect badge on my left breast pocket and smiled . I shrugged . I was embarrassed but did n\'t want to show it . " I have to go now . Drop by if you want to chat . Ride your bike over . " " How do you know I have a bike ? " " I \'ve seen you bike around . I live in B-63 . Come for a cold coffee on Saturday morning . " " All right . " " That \'s tomorrow , " she said , squeezing my hand , and left . I could n\'t place her . Indians , myself included , must immediately place everyone we meet . We are a nation of taxonomists . It must be in our genes because of the caste           foreign car or not , brahmin or banya or what , English-speaking or not , meat-eating or not , if vegetarian then whether an eggitarian or strict , if strict then too strict to eat Western desserts with egg or not . All this in the case of women helps predict whether they might be led astray . In the case of men , whether they will misbehave with women given half a chance , take bribes , support their parents in old age , and on and on . The system works . It is a science , thousands of years old , that has been taken to the level of a fine art . I often scorned it , but if I had to put my hand on my heart I \'d have to admit that I operated by it . It was natural for me to classify people at first sight without even being aware of it . Love happens on the edges . It happens when one ca n\'t place someone ; so does hate . India was an enigma . And correspondingly rife with possibility           was like most other Friday evenings . I went with my parents to a dinner party . The ladies all sat in one section of the living room and the gents in the other . Thanks to my age I could mill around both groups . No other kids were present . My parents often took me with them to social occasions . Over the years I \'d gotten used to the company of people much older than myself . " Do you know a good servant ? Mine is going on leave for a month , " lady A said . " Mine is giving trouble , " lady B chimed in . " Servants these days , I tell you , " added lady C. I walked over to the other side where the men were discussing the India and Pakistan cricket match . I have nothing against sports , but men with thickening waists and a couple of artificial valves in their hearts discussing a five-day test match are not the most spectacular company . I went back to the women and decided to entertain myself .           around the folds of their waists , the shapelessness of their backs clearly visible . I visualized them minus their small , tight blouses . One of the reasons for the accuracy of the classification system is that its criteria are always spur of the moment and can be tailored to fit the occasion . Each situation generates its own classification . For example , the most obvious question to ask when you unbutton an Indian woman \'s blouse is whether she waxes her underarms . There are other less interesting ones , like what sort of bra she is wearing . This second question is not intrinsically uninteresting , but at that time there was just one company that made quality undergarments for women , and it made only five designs . I was able to classify most of the women at first glance . One woman , let \'s call her lady X , was difficult to place . I unbuttoned her blouse several times in my head and tried imagining the two scenarioswaxed or not . Each seemed equally likely . I observed her closely for more           , it \'s either because she \'s terribly old-fashioned , or terribly postmodern . I could n\'t tell if lady X was a radical feminist . I was certain she was n\'t old-fashioned . If a woman does wax her underarms she might be very hip or just middle-class in her mentality . If I could get her type down I \'d know which parts of her body she depilated . Or if I knew which parts she depilated I could get her type down . The hostess announced dinner while I was busy unbuttoning lady X. I took the general movement around the room as an opportunity to strike up a conversation with her . In a minute I discovered that she read no books , went to the beauty parlor for pedicures , and did n\'t work . I lost interest in her . The inquiry was complete . She did indeed wax and was predictably bourgeois . I wondered about India , but the idea of unbuttoning her blouse filled me with such turmoil that I abandoned the half thought to the samosas on my plate .           the next morning , I agonized about what to wear . A lot of my clothes were still young and girlie . I chose my red striped boys \' shirt and jeans . I wore black boys \' shoes , slapped some Old Spice on my neck from my father \'s toilette , and rode my bicycle over . I went at ten since she had n\'t told me when to come . Nine seemed too early for a Saturday . My stomach was knotted , and my back felt very tight . India was beautiful , and she was waiting for me . My tongue was jammed in my throat . This made polite conversation somewhat inconvenient . When she offered to make me a frothy coffee shake , I followed her into the kitchen and got ice cubes from the fridge on her orders . We took our tall glasses of cold coffee and went to the veranda in the rear of her house . I sat on the cemented ground at her feet , my shoulders leaning against the legs of her cane garden chair . I           I was embarrassed by the thoughts I had had about her the previous night . It did n\'t matter that I had unbuttoned all the other women \'s blouses ; only with India was there something indecent about it . We talked about my school and her son for a while . I had not discussed anything in this fashion with a grown-up before . My parents , their friends , and my teachers treated me like a kid , albeit a mature one . India was talking to me like I was an adult . " Where is your son ? " I asked . " Till I can arrange for him to change schools , he \'s going to be with his dad . " She was divorced , and we were alone . Both facts made me unreasonably excited . " How long can you stay ? " she asked . " About an hour , " I said . I routinely went cycling for an hour on Saturday . If I stayed longer my mother would definitely ask me where I had been . India lit           know any women who smoked . I had seen women from the jhuggis smoke bidis , and once at a very snobbish party that one of my father \'s work contacts had invited us to , a few women had been smoking . We sat quietly while India smoked . When she was finished she threw the cigarette stub by her foot and crushed it . " You have such thick hair , " she said , running her hand through it . My hair was out of control and , according to Sheela , a girl in my class , Jimi Hendrix-like . I had to wash it every day so it would n\'t get knotted . As soon as it grew down to my shoulders , the curls would take on a life of their own , and I would have to trim it . " Want me to put oil in your hair ? " she asked . I personally could not stand the idea of scented coconut oil dribbling down my scalp . The advertisements on TV for Parachute coconut oil were aimed at the likes           no to India . Not ever and not for anything . " We \'re having problems with our water supply , and I wo n\'t be able to wash it off , " I said . Then without thinking I said , " But I could put oil in your hair . " " That would be lovely , " she said . I realized I had made a smooth move . We went into her bedroom . She put oil in a small steel bowl and lay down on the bed with a towel under her head . As I massaged the oil into her black tresses , she let out little ooh-aahs of pleasure . I got absorbed in her glistening skin and in the way my fingers slid easily because of the oil . After her hair had soaked up the fluid I massaged the base of her neck . " An hour is up . I do n\'t want you to be late . Your mother will worry , " she said . I brushed my forefinger on her neck one last time and got up           stood in an uncomfortable silence . I wanted to hug her , but my heart was making embarrassing noises , and if I moved closer I was sure that she would hear them . " I hope you \'ll come again , " she said . I was taken aback by her formality . I mounted my bike and put my foot on the pedal . " Next Saturday , come early , " she said , patting the steel carrier behind the seat of my bike . Without turning around I made an affirmative noise in my throat . Then I pedaled away furiously . After I turned the corner I slowed down . I was not ready to go home . Between India \'s house and mine there was a vacant plot of land where a building was under construction . The workers had built jhuggis on one end of the site . They lived there with their children . I decided to take a shortcut and ride my bike through this stretch to avoid the main road . One section of the plot was empty . I           the workers . A good three-fourths of the way through I noticed a woman squatting behind a bush , no doubt taking a pee . I got off my bike and stood still . I did n\'t want to ride behind her and scare her . I tried to look away but could n\'t . I watched her peeing from the corner of my eye . Her sari was hitched up , and her ankles were visible . After a few seconds the woman got up , turned around , and saw me . Her skin was dark from being exposed to the sun all day . A fiery red line of sindhoor adorned the parting of her hair , indicating that she was married . She stared at me , and then in an exaggerated gesture she turned , lifted her sari all the way up to her bare ass , and jiggled her backside . I thought she was trying to spite me for having stared at her , but then she turned back around , looked me in the eye , and walked away . \n Operating Instructions By Anne Lamott Random House Anne Lamott SOME THOUGHTS ON BEING PREGNANT : A PREFACE OF SORTS I woke up with a start at 4:00 one morning and realized that I was very , very pregnant . Since I had conceived six months earlier , one might have thought that the news would have sunk in before then , and in many ways it had , but it was on that early morning in May that I first realized how severely pregnant I was . What tipped me off was that , lying on my side and needing to turn over , I found myself unable to move . My first thought was that I had had a stroke . Nowadays I go around being aware that I am pregnant with the same constancy and lack of surprise with which I go around being aware that I have teeth . But a few times a day the information actually causes me to gasp-how on earth did I come to be in this condition ? Well , I have a few suspicions . I mean , I am beginning to put two and two together . See ,           longer around , and my stomach is noticeably bigger every few days . I could have had an abortion-the pressure to do so was extraordinary-and if need be , I would take to the streets , armed , to defend the right of any woman for any reason to terminate a pregnancy , but I was totally unable to do so this time psychologically , psychically , emotionally . Just totally . So I am going to have a baby pretty soon , and this has raised some mind-boggling issues . For instance , it occurs to me over and over that I am much too self-centered , cynical , eccentric , and edgy to raise a baby , especially alone . ( The baby \'s father was dramatically less excited than I was to find out I was pregnant , so much so that I have not seen or heard from him in months and do n\'t expect to ever again . ) At thirty-five years old , I may be too old and too tired to be having my first child . And I really did think for           it is not second nature for me to believe that everything is more or less okay . Clearly , my nerves are shot . For example , the other day one of the innumerable deer that come down here from the mountain to eat in the garden and drink from the stream remained where it was as I got closer and closer . It was standing between me and my front door . I thought , Boy , they \'re getting brazen , and I walked closer and closer to it , finally to within four or five feet , when suddenly it tensed . My first thought was that it was about to lunge at me , snarling . Of course it turned instead and bolted through the woods , but I was left with the increasingly familiar sense that I am losing my grasp on reality . One moment I \'m walking along the salt marsh listening to sacred choral music on headphones , convinced that the music is being piped in through my ears , into my head , down my throat , and into my torso           and the next moment I \'m walking along coaching the baby on how best to grow various body parts . What are you , some kind of nut ? I ask myself , and I know the answer is yes , some kind of nut , and maybe one who is not well enough to be a mother . But this is not the worst fear . Even the three weeks of waiting for the results of the amniocentesis were n\'t the most fearful part , nor was the amnio itself . It was , in fact , one of the sweetest experiences of my life . My friend Manning drove me into San Francisco and stayed with me through the procedure , and , well , talk about intimate . It made sex look like a game of Twister . I lay there on the little table at the hospital with my stomach sticking out , Manning near my head holding my hands , a nurse by my feet patting me from time to time , one doctor running the ultrasound device around and around the surface of my           his turn with the needles . The ultrasound doctor was showing me the first pictures of my baby , who was at that point a four-month-old fetus . He was saying , " Ah , there \'s the head now . . . there \'s the leg . . . there \'s its bottom , " and I was watching it all on the screen , nodding , even though it was all just underwater photography , all quite ethereal and murky . Manning said it was like watching those first men on the moon . I pretended to be able to distinguish each section of the baby because I did n\'t want the doctor to think I was a lousy mother who was already judging the kid for not being photogenically distinct enough . He pointed out the vertebrae , a sweet curved strand of pearls , and then the heart , beating as visibly as a pulsar , and that was when I started to cry . Then the other doctor took one of his needles and put it right through my stomach , near my belly button           with the end of a straw . I felt a pinch , and then mild cramping , and that was all , as the doctor began to withdraw some amniotic fluid . Now you probably think , like I thought , that this fluid is some vaguely holy saltwater , flown in from the coast for the occasion , but it is mostly baby pee , light green in color . What they do with it then is to send it to the lab , where they culture it , growing enough cells from the tissue the baby has sloughed off into the amniotic fluid to determine if there are chromosomal abnormalities and whether it is a boy or a girl , if you care to know . During the first week of waiting , you actually believe your baby is okay , because you saw it scoot around during the ultrasound and because most babies are okay . By the middle of the second week , things are getting a bit dicey in your head , but most of the time you still think the baby is okay .           , you come to know-not to believe but to know-that you are carrying a baby inside you in only the broadest sense of the word baby , because what is growing in there has a head the size of a mung bean , with almost no brain at all because all available tissue has gone into the building of a breathtaking collection of arms and knees-maybe not too many arms but knees absolutely everywhere . Finally , though , the nurse who had patted my feet during the amnio called , and the first thing she said was that she had good news , and I thought I might actually throw up from sheer joy . Then she talked about the findings for a while , although I did not hear a word , and then she said , " Do you want to know its sex ? " And I said yes I did . It is a boy . His name is Sam Lamott . Samuel John Stephen Lamott . ( My brothers \' names are John and Steve . ) A boy . Do you know what           girls do n\'t ? That \'s right , there you go . They have penises . And like most of my women friends , I have somewhat mixed feelings about this . Now , I do n\'t know how to put this delicately , but I have never been quite the same since seeing a penis up close while I was on LSD years and years ago . It was an actual penis ; I mean , it was n\'t like I was staring at my hand for an hour and watched it turn into my grandfather \'s face and then into a bat and then into a penis . It was the real thing . It was my boyfriend \'s real thing , and what it looked like was the root of all my insanity , of a lot of my suffering and obsession . It looked like a cross between a snake and a heart . That is a really intense thing you boys have there , and we internal Americans of the hetero persuasion have really , really conflicted feelings about you external Americans because of the           , and especially their power over you . I ask you once again to remember the old joke in which the puzzled , defensive man says , " I did n\'t want to go to Las Vegas , " then points to his crotch and says , " He wanted to go to Las Vegas . " So it has given me pause to learn that there is a baby boy growing in my belly who apparently has all the right number of hands and feet and arms and legs and knees , a normal-size head , and a penis . Penises are so-what is the word ? -funky . They \'re wonderful , too , and I love them , but over the years such bad things have happened to me because of them . I \'ve gotten pregnant , even when I tried so hard not to , and I \'ve gotten diseases , where you could n\'t see any evidence of disease on the man \'s dick and he claims not to have anything , but you end up having to get treatment and it \'s totally           at you for having caught it , even though you have n\'t slept with anyone else for months or even years . It is my secret belief that men love their penises so much that when they take them in to show their doctors , after their women claim to have caught a little something , the male doctors get caught up in this penis love , whack the patient ( your lover ) on the back , and say thunderously , " Now do n\'t be silly , that \'s a damn fine penis you \'ve got there . " A man told me once that all men like to look at themselves in the mirror when they \'re hard , and now I keep picturing Sam in twenty years , gazing at his penis in the mirror while feeling psychologically somewhere between Ivan Boesky and Mickey Mantle . I also know he will be someone who will one day pee with pride , because all men do , standing there manfully tearing bits of toilet paper to shreds with their straight and forceful sprays , carrying on as           Battle of Midway , for instance . So of course I \'m a little edgy about the whole thing , about my child having a penis instead of a nice delicate little lamb of a vagina . But even so , this is still not the worst fear . No , the worst thing , worse even than sitting around crying about that inevitable day when my son will leave for college , worse than thinking about whether or not in the meantime to get him those hideous baby shots he probably should have but that some babies die from , worse than the fears I have when I lie awake at 3:00 in the morning ( that I wo n\'t be able to make enough money and will have to live in a tenement house where the rats will bite our heads while we sleep , or that I will lose my arms in some tragic accident and will have to go to court and diaper my son using only my mouth and feet and the judge wo n\'t think I \'ve done a good enough job and will           than the fear I feel whenever a car full of teenagers drives past my house going 200 miles an hour on our sleepy little street , worse than thinking about my son being run over by one of those drunken teenagers , or of his one day becoming one of those teenagers- worse than just about anything else is the agonizing issue of how on earth anyone can bring a child into this world knowing full well that he or she is eventually going to have to go through the seventh and eighth grades . The seventh and eighth grades were for me , and for every single good and interesting person I \'ve ever known , what the writers of the Bible meant when they used the words hell and the pit . Seventh and eighth grades were a place into which one descended . One descended from the relative safety and wildness and bigness one felt in sixth grade , eleven years old . Then the worm turned , and it was all over for any small feeling that one was essentially all right . One was n\'t           was suddenly a Diane Arbus character . It was springtime , for Hitler , and Germany . I experienced it as being a two-year game of " The Farmer in the Dell . " I hung out with the popular crowd , as jester , but boy , when those parties and dances rolled round , this cheese stood alone , watching my friends go steady and kiss , and then , like all you other cheeses , I went home and cried . There we were , all of us cheeses alone , emotionally broken by unrequited love and at the same time amped out of our minds on hormones and shame . Seventh and eighth grades were about waiting to get picked for teams , waiting to get asked to dance , waiting to grow taller , waiting to grow breasts . They were about praying for God to grow dark hairs on my legs so I could shave them . They were about having pipe-cleaner legs . They were about violence , meanness , chaos . They were about The Lord of the Flies . They were           , they were about hurt and aloneness . There is a beautiful poem by a man named Roy Fuller , which ends , " Hurt beyond hurting , never to forget , " and whenever I remember those lines , which is often , I think of my father \'s death ten years ago this month , and I think about seventh and eighth grades . So how on earth can I bring a child into the world , knowing that such sorrow lies ahead , that it is such a large part of what it means to be human ? \n November breaks up a Northern city into its separate lives . No one lingers on granite planters , strangers stop making conversation pigeons go unfed . Murk settles over the river and dusk comes mid-morning . Buildings lose their heads , faces grow indistinct . In the evening , trains and buses fill up with individuals , and the bodies layered in bulky clothing shrink from the coming winter and one another . The yellow glow in windows lights them safely home . This is the new center of life : The household becomes the temple , the family the god . Even those who have no home disappear , crowding the shelters . Every November , when the sky turns leaden and the clock have been set back , the larger body dies and the idea of the city becomes a memory , an accident of warm weather . More than the fall of leaves and the flight of geese , this memory explains November \'s sadness in a Northern city . That November in Cambridge , across the river from Boston , people started noticing signs . Teal-colored flyers , recognizable from a distance on lampposts ,           clinics , or around the new construction site . Cryptic phrases in small black type . No One Is Excused . Do You Know Where You Live ? Who Is Your Neighbor ? You Could Be Anyone . No one claimed responsibility , and the signs became a conversation piece and source of speculation--a terrorist cell with a set humor , an ad campaign for a blockbuster movie , a millenarian lunatic . Their appearance , just at the moment when cold weather and early darkness arrived to close up windows and doors , worked strangely on people \'s nerves . The signs irritated and disturbed some ; in others they woke nameless longings . The feelings were rawest where the signs were thickest , in the heart of the city--the several dingy blocks of Massachusetts Avenue , its main artery , growing dingier toward the river--known as Central Square . By late November , these nerves and signs were all that remained of the idea of the city . In her blind basement office in Central Square , Paula Voorhees sat listening to Gladys Dill . " Uh-uh ,           when he comes home all depressed from being dissed at the garage and I do n\'t know how to make him feel good . And he starts screaming at me and Michael and that \'s when the feeling is like , I must be crazy to be here even though I love James , like I \'m enabling him by being passive and all . I do n\'t know . " Paula \'s eyes shifted from Gladys to the wall clock behind her . " It sounds like you feel both responsible and helpless . " She watched the last minute tick down . " No wonder you think you \'re going crazy . " " I do n\'t know . OK , I know , time \'s up . " The chairs were arranged in the room--windowless , a midsized closet--so that only Paula could see the clock . Between her and Gladys there was a low table with a box of Kleenex on it . Today no tears had accompanied the catalog of James trouble and money trouble and childhood trouble . Gladys had come in with one           look crazy . The naked eye was a little unnerving--half of Gladys \'s face seemed to be analyzing her . But Paula was an expert listener even when she was n\'t listening . She sat forward . Gladys Dill slumped , unbudging . Paula imagined hauling her large body out of the room , heaving it out of the basement , into ... life . Her stuckness was maddening . " I do n\'t think I can keep coming . " Familiar stuff ; and the hour was up . " Why not ? " " Michael \'s asthma medicine . They \'re fixing to shut the gas off . " " Next time let \'s talk about adjusting your fee again . " " I \'m just trying to figure out what we accomplished today . " Paula \'s mouth went dry . " You made a connection between James \'s troubles at the garage and your stepfather \'s anger . Do n\'t you think that \'s something to pursue next week ? " Now the lensless eye reddened , and the other disappeared behind fog . " But           the chair . Her own vocabulary was boomeranging . We need more black therapists , she thought , this one really ought to be seeing a black woman . " If you can feel these things in here , " she said , passing the Kleenex box , " you \'ll have a safe place to work on them . That will make it easier to get what you want out there . " Paula had resorted to talking shit . Suddenly Gladys gave back the Kleenex box , gathered herself , and stood up . " OK . See you next week . " Gladys Dill was nearly six feet tall , thick-bodied and short-haired . In her beret and long winter coat she looked like a different woman , maybe the one Paula never saw , the one who was raising a child and had trained as a nurse \'s aide before cocaine messed up her plans . The transformation came as a rebuke . After showing her out , Paula sat and stared at the Cape Cod beach that Fran , her office-mate , had hung over           and blue calm enraged her . Her progress file lay open on the desk . Gladys Dill was her last of the day . At the very least she could have said , " You \'re mad at me . " And then Gladys would have denied it , and the notion of being mad would have hovered over her thoughts for a week , and by next week they might have finally reached Square B. But it was n\'t nice to have people mad at you . It was nicer when they teared up and you passed the Kleenex . So instead Gladys had left the way she always left , depressed . And what good have you done her ? Once , she got the gas turned back on in Gladys \'s apartment in the Columbia Street projects . A call to Com Gas , her professional voice informing some clerk that Ms. Dill suffered a disability , and it was done . A seductive revelation--more power than she knew she had . But it was just crisis management , not the real work , which was supposed           , perilous place that could n\'t be fixed with a phone call . This real work never seemed to get done because there was always an eviction crisis or a violence crisis or a drug-relapse crisis , the crisis that had sent Gladys via the hospital to the Problem Place and Paula \'s office . She would be taking this one home . It was working on her nervous system like a third cup of coffee . " Staff meeting , sweetheart . " Fran stood in the door . Her peasant skirt and bonnet of frizzy gray hair suggested an embittered hippie turned Puritan . Paula said , " All we ever do around here is talk . " " Who did you just have ? " " The asthmatic \'s mother . " " She sounds very damaged . " Every one of Fran \'s clients turned out to be an abuse case . For all Paula knew it was true , but her own overripe sense of ambiguity compelled her to explore other regions for the sources of human misery . Irritated and chairbound , unable to           herself . " She wanted to know what good it does her to talk to me . " " Hey , great ! You can really work with that . " " It \'s a good question , is n\'t it ? Talk does n\'t pay for Michael \'s asthma medicine . It does n\'t stop James from scaring the hell out of her . It \'s a fucking good question . " Fran frowned . Profanity was the language of the clients , displaying lack of impulse control . " But you can help her see how the victimization works . " " Com Gas is going to cut her a break for self-awareness ? At the very least that woman needs a shrink whose skin is thicker and darker than mine . " " This is very negative talk I \'m hearing , " Fran said . " Bring it to the meeting . We \'ve all been there , sweetheart . " " You go ahead . I need to catch up on my notes . " Alone , Paula went back over the day . In           , whose wife had given him the get-help-or-I\'m-leaving ultimatum . After that came Raul , her sweet closet transvestite who , she felt pretty sure , was developing a crush on his therapist . She had hope for Raul . He was able to love and one day he might be capable of loving himself . She felt not nearly so sanguine about Earl , overweight and unemployed , a victim of corporate downsizing on Route 128 . Middle management had held Earl \'s being together . Now , having lost status , function , and wife , he \'d turned to eating undistributed Halloween candy in front of late-night TV and shouting obscenities at the screen . Earl \'s life was a nonstop parade of comedowns and insults . The delicate move was getting past the paranoia without making him out to be a total failure . Today , through his Xanax fog , he let Paula know that she inspired homicidal feelings . This was progress , but it felt like training a drugged bear to perform tricks designed to put her life at risk . The one           fear , for he was not so paranoid that he did n\'t grasp what was happening to him . But sometimes she flashed on his body crushing hers , pumping hard . In the tiny office their sessions were tense , and small-boned Paula had trouble drawing breath . Then Gladys Dill , with her question . Paula sat with her pen poised . She had been a good listener all her life , having been born , she was told , without making a sound . Sometimes she thought of herself as the priest she stopped seeing around her first period , his side of the confessional silent except for nasal breathing . Other times she felt like a hooker hired by the hour to coax vices , hand out Kleenex , make the client feel that she cared for no one else in the world . In return they told her about cruel fathers , indifferent mothers , devouring lovers , maddening children , humiliating bosses . Some were tormented by the lottery , some considered getting out of bed a victory . Many of them told her           one else in the world to talk to . Today this thought saddened her beyond words . Entering the conference room , she was surprised by the color of twilight through the casement window at sidewalk level . " We ca n\'t start without Paula . " Peter Fine watched as she squeezed behind the chairs . " Paula is indispensable . " The executive director of the Problem Place sat gnome-like in his armchair at the head of the table , trim-bearded , plump in his sweater vest , his stocking feet pulled up on the cushion and cozily crossed at the ankles . Around the table sat his harem of dependent , resentful MSWs and PsyDs . Except for Philip , who was gay , Fine was the only man in the room . " I have important news so I \'ll get straight to the point , " Fine said--but first there was praise for his staff \'s dedication ; a plug for a paper he was writing with Suzanne Martin , his associate director , on post-traumatic stress in children of divorced parents ; a reference           manic-depressive woman and her affectless husband ( today both cried ) . Suzanne looked on smilingly ; glancing at Paula , she rolled her eyes as if they were secret confidantes . According to Fran , Suzanne was the mother who refused to see that her children were being incested . Paula looked around the table . Her colleagues were listening with attitudes of numb rage . She thought : What am I doing here ? There were a hundred other things she could do . Like work at a big hospital where you did n\'t have to hear your boss go on about " therapeutic courage . " Or just get out of the field . She could do that . She sometimes thought that her real talent , the one going to waste , was as a private investigator . She loved detail and had an infallible nose for guilt . She was n\'t the type of therapist who was too weird for any other kind of work . " OK , " Fine at last getting to the point . " Unfortunately , today \'s topic is           n\'t it be great if we could do our work as healers without thinking about money ? We know that \'s not the real world . The Department of Mental Health has decided not to renew our allowance . " With a mental clunk , Paula returned to the table . From Fran and Philip \'s corner came audible groans . Suzanne , who \'d obviously heard the news and whose job was secure , dished around looks of pained sympathy . " I do n\'t have to tell you contributions are down--empathy fatigue , structural recession , I \'m not interested in labels . Now the Commonwealth in its wisdom decides sports arenas are more important than the psychic wholeness of the underprivileged . No one here wants to get into short-term therapy and meds-- " " What \'s the bad news , Peter ? " asked Sara Simon , Paula \'s one friend here . Fine took a breath . " As of January first , all staff clinicians will move to a fee-for-service basis as independent contractors . " Around the table there was stunned silence .           health benefits . You \'ll be doing a lot more paperwork . If a client does n\'t show , you \'ll have to reimburse their part of the fee . " Fine was nodding with the gravity of a clergyman comforting his flock in the face of collective tragedy . " I know this is upsetting . I \'m upset--I \'m very upset . There are going to be painful decisions about who can continue here . But some of you could turn this into a positive and pick up more client hours . " Paula \'s throat was burning--nausea coming on . There were no jobs , everyone knew that . Therapists were moving to other states . Social workers with union cards were living off unemployment or going into day care . It was cold and gloomy out there and once you were thrown outside you never got back in , unless you were willing to commute an hour to work with violent teenagers in Lawrence . But she did n\'t even have a car . She had no connections , had n\'t even bothered schmoozing when she           last week . " Do n\'t you sometimes think , " Fine asked , " there \'s a plague on men and women today ? And the symptom is a fearful and rageful hardening of the heart ? And we in this room know the cure but no one listens ? I think there is a plague and it \'s called All Against All , and it \'s killing us . America should be quarantined . This basement may be our last sanctuary . " Fine openly desired the status of therapeutic rock star . He wanted to counsel in stadiums or on public television , and he sometimes spoke as if the clients interfered with his work . He believed that shrinks suffered from lack of vision . Thousands of them toiling away separately in fifty-minute hours--if they looked up long enough to realize their collective strength , they could treat the nation \'s damaged psyche . His ambition mirrored Paula \'s restlessness , grossly magnified and distorted . She had started out a favorite . With Fine there was never a clear line between supervision and foreplay ,           faithful to the childless wife no one ever saw--and Paula once told Sara Simon that it would be better for everyone if Fine just bedded one of the harem so he could abstain from mind-fucking everyone else . Still , she had refused even sublimated concubinage , and it was partly her fault that he decided she was an enemy . She lacked the therapist \'s gift for euphemism , not because she was confident but because she was shy . She had n\'t been political . She should have been volunteering to do research papers with him , instead of walking into staff meetings late . Now she \'d be the first one Fine cut . It was stupid and reckless to be superior to all the crap you had to do to survive . Paula \'s stomach was turning over . How would she tell them ? Gladys Dill would die without her . Earl would end up in Walpole Prison . " We \'ve been addicted to government , " Fine was saying . " Now we \'re clean and free to create something totally new .           now in this very city . This very room . " " Peter , there \'s private grant money out there . " Paula was speaking rapidly and her voice sounded unnatural . " I could do some research on it . " In silence , a dozen therapists processed this event . Fran \'s stare accused Paula of betrayal . Fine \'s lips opened a pink hole in his beard . " Beautiful , Paula . " She crossed her legs under the table . She felt dirty . No one got off free with Fine . But she could tell that he was relieved to have her on his side--she frightened him . At their core these megalomaniacs were little boys trying to please Mama . Fine talked on , and the staff sank into depression . Outside it was night ; trouser legs , coat hems , winter shoes walked past the casement window , people going home at the end of their workday . In the cramped conference room they were all sucking the available air into their self-monitoring , overheated brains . Paula felt a           made for the door , but Fine intercepted her . " Stay late tonight . " His voice was intimate . " Something \'s happened to my Wednesday evening group . This guy from out of town , a kind of organizer , he contacted me . He wanted me to open it up to new people . A new group every week . " " What about your old people ? " Fine smiled enigmatically and shook his head . He was standing so close that she could see the shaved bristles above his sculpted beard . " The whole focus is changing . It \'s outward-oriented , community-oriented . This is what we \'ve needed . " He extended a finger to within three inches of her sweater above the breast . " What you \'ve needed , Paula . Other people . Is n\'t it ? " Her face grew hot ; she knew she was coloring . She had no idea what he meant but felt utterly transparent . " I have something tonight . Next week ? " " OK . " Fine released her           come back to me , Paula . " Fleeing up the exit stairs , she was pursued by Sara Simon . " Dum-da-dum-dum , " Sara said . " The beginning of the end . " " For me . He \'ll keep you because you \'re prettier . " Paula was about to say that with Fine being pretty had its disadvantages . But she realized it would n\'t console Sara . " None of us will go . We \'ll have a revolution and throw him out . " " And tear him to pieces like the women in that Greek play . It really sucks--he and Suzanne stay on salary , of course . Want to have dinner at the new Mexican place ? " " I\'m--going to the movies . " " Sounds like fun . " Sara brushed a ringlet of hair from her face . " Do I know the guy ? " " It \'s not a guy , " Paula lied again . In the bad light of the stairway Sara looked pale and puffy . She was five years deeper into           the guy ? " was both confession and rebuke . Sara was irremediably single . She had a body firmed up at the YMCA down the street , and a dry wit that appealed to Paula in an otherwise irony-free workplace . Yet her singleness had become a condition--suppressed panic with a whiff of cat hair . But Sara would never go to fat and enlist in the sisterhood with Fran . The tragedy was that she could n\'t imagine happiness without a man . She never addressed the subject directly , but it never failed to come up , like someone dying of cancer , deep in denial , yet forever complaining about mysterious stomachaches . Paula sometimes caught in Sara \'s eyes the devouring look of the doomed : You too some day , you too . " How about tomorrow ? " Paula said . " I have therapy . " In spite of the lies , Sara was n\'t letting her off easy . " Well , it \'s home to Lucy and Spike , the little ingrates . Have a good time , Paula .           Sara disappeared into the subway . Paula began walking down Mass . Avenue . The sidewalk was slick with rain , and a frozen mist descended on her hair . She \'d forgotten her umbrella again . The traffic slid thickly by and at the corner the Number 1 bus wheezed to a stop , splashing the people waiting to board . Paula turned and saw a big man in a shapeless suit coming at her . For a heart-stopping second she thought it was Earl , smiling , approaching to kill with bare hands . The man mimicked her startle , throwing his shoulders back in stylized surprise . When she tried to pass , he stepped in her path . She went the other way and he moved to block her , his pasty face hugely amused . " Fuck off , " she said with false bravado . " Only if you help . " She managed to get around him , head down , pushing on past the discount children \'s clothing store , where a secret pedophile was peering in the window . In the           down ; she imagined a gun in his backpack . It was the witching hour , when the whole world went mad . Out of the clinic into rush-hour Central Square , Paula encountered a city full of lunatics . They came out of the cold fog faster than she could keep track . This elegant woman waving for a cab to take her home to her husband \'s emotional blackmail . These little wailing children dragged along by their mother who was straining against the urge to infanticide . The men whose minds lurched from rape to rape , the women who tore out clumps of their own hair . The respectable alcoholics and the surprise addicts , the liars , self-deceivers , self-haters , the ones who did n\'t know about themselves half the things Paula knew from a glance at their public faces . The fog was electric with every kind of disturbance . As she walked , the charge crackled inside her . In the clinic , talk grounded it and the basement \'s thick stone walls retained it . Here on the street it ran           minutes ago the thought of not being allowed to spend her days bathed in the psychic ills of poor people had made her sick to her stomach . Recently , Paula had begun to suspect that she lacked the talent of living--of simply entering the mindless stream of life . And that her job was the main expression of this lack , as well as its cause . Anyone who needed a job that badly deserved to be let go . Gladys Dill had handed her an opportunity and she had blown it . As if the others could do any better . Fran would be so earnest that Gladys would have to kill herself . And Fine ! Fine would n\'t last a minute with Earl , he \'d say things like " community-oriented " and Earl would have to kill him . Down the avenue , past the new building going up on what had been for years an empty lot . One day a crater appeared , and now two stories of skeletal steel gleamed in the streetlamps and headlights . Chain link protected the site but           a sewer was rerouted for the foundation . Paula read the latest blue signs on the fence . " Who owns the building ? " " What is the building for ? " Some paranoid grad-school dropout , hunched over his computer at 3 A.M. Soon she would read about the blue-flyer bombings . She stopped by The King and I for the order Steve would have phoned ahead . His loft was next door above a photocopy store . He was a forty-year-old city planner , and there was n\'t much else she knew about Steve Lorenz . When she rang she was instantly buzzed in . Being buzzed in without a question was part of the secret excitement of Wednesday night . " You again , " he said at the front door . She had forgotten the ponytail and earring , because she disapproved--wanted to tell him , " Do n\'t do that , you do n\'t need to . " The strong stubbled jawline and sly gray eyes she remembered . In jeans and a bulky maroon sweater he cut a lean figure of advancing hipness           my hands . " She held them out and Steve gave a vigorous chafing . He pulled her toward him and then there was the unbelievable softness of human lips . So much of the time everyone had to keep their hands to themselves , brain-stuffed and sense-starved . Tonight , after her brush with a cold , jobless , clientless world , she felt more grateful than usual to be here , to be kissed . Steve ran his hand through the back of her wavy black hair . Though he cultivated detachment , she knew it was the same for him--the surprise , the pleasure . " It \'s wet out there , " Steve said . " Wet and wild . " " Central Square ? Come on . " " It \'s all invisible . " " This city , " he said , " is more repressed than Orem , Utah . First Puritans , then Catholics , then liberals , then yuppies . Herbal or Earl Grey ? " He could be a bore on the subject of Old Cambridge before **26;280;TOOLONG the Ford-Carter           n\'t mind , because Steve was n\'t her boyfriend . He was Wednesday night , the way a therapist only existed on the day of your session . There was an archaic word that she liked : tryst . Her pattern was either infatuation with men dimly aware of her existence or else apologetic and repelled flight from the heartbroken . But she and Steve had slept together immediately , without fear or regret . Having no future made them calm and generous . Why they had no future she did n\'t know . " It is n\'t fair , " she said as they sat on the wood floor to eat from his junk-shop coffee table . " Of course it is n\'t . What ? " " Biology . Demographics . I have a friend who \'s thirty-six and-- " " Nope , too old . That \'s when they start to get scary . " His irony irritated her , too safe and smug . " That \'s what I mean . The other day I heard a man tell another guy , quote , I need           . \' This guy had gray hair . He was at least fifty . Who the hell does he think he is , talking like that ? " " He \'s Educated American Male . He \'s pushing the evolutionary envelope . " " He ought to be helping his wife through menopause . It \'s obscene . " " While your friend \'s eggs go to waste . It is n\'t fair . " In Steve \'s good looks there was a sort of decayed youthfulness . All these years on the scene of his higher education , haunting the same bookstores , watching his favorite bars turn into boutiques , had arrested his growth . In ten years Steve would be telling someone about his intensity . He was reporting on his current peeve : the half-finished construction site up the street . " What \'s that building for anyway ? " " I just told you , Paula , nobody has a clue , that \'s the problem . " She had been thinking about Fine--Fine wanted the building for the Problem Place . Big ideas while           he mean , " You \'ve needed this " ? What did she need ? " The owner was building office space , " Steve said . " He had his problems with the IRS and lost it . The city took over and now no one can make a decision and the work \'s still going on . I \'m surprised you do n\'t know any of this . " " I should be more political . " " Now everyone \'s getting in on the act . An AIDS clinic , says the gay community . A youth center , says the--the African American community . Oh no , say the homeless advocates , a wet shelter . We \'ll buy it , says big bad MIT . Twenty developers want to bid for retail plus luxury housing . There \'s even a rumor a Florida gaming enterprise is interested . A casino in Central Square ! And the city council is shitting its pants , like Building ? What building ? \' " Paula nodded , locked her eyes on Steve \'s , and timed her "           he might clam up any second . " Anyway , it \'s not important . " " I \'m sorry , I was listening . " " Never mind . Let \'s hear about your day with the emotionally challenged . " Pouting made Steve \'s fork clumsy with the yellow-curry beef , and it blew away her fantasy of an insouciant at ease in a world that bewildered and threatened her . What , she wondered , was his fantasy of her ? Dark pretty little sister of charity with a fun side . Tending to the poor and then to him . She told Steve about Fine and the cutbacks but left out the moment of her undoing with Gladys Dill . " It scares me to need this job that much . I literally ca n\'t imagine how I \'d live without it . " His eyes were unfocusing . She wondered if marriage was like this . They watched a video . Nestled against his chest , she drifted in and out of sleep , feeling a vague urgency to keep him talking , and the           stop if she faded out , wanting to apologize to them all every time she woke up . Finally she gave in to the downward pull . Paula jerked awake as Steve was rewinding . " Great movie . " " Do you always twitch in your sleep so much ? " " I do n\'t know , I \'m always asleep . " She did n\'t like being seen unconscious , nerves discharging the day \'s electricity after the current is switched off . " They say you have to trust someone to sleep in their presence . " " I think I \'m just really tired . " Not that I do n\'t trust you , she thought . What could the word mean for them ? He mimed a hurt face as he cleared the plates , mocking himself , and it was enough to make her like him again . When Steve came back from the kitchen she reached for his hand , pulling herself up into a kiss . She enjoyed her ability to please him ; the sex itself she liked better than cooking           almost a year without--the period when the talent of living had begun to elude her . She knew that men liked the way she looked and the things she did , but a strange detachment from her own body had set in , as if it were made of foam rubber wired to her nervous system . Once sex had been an effortless pleasure , she \'d jumped into bed with men she did n\'t care to remember now . She longed for this one to take her out of her head . The ritual of undressing , condom-fumbling . His style of narcissism was to let her come first , but tonight , with Gladys and everything else , she knew it was hopeless and coaxed him along . " What about you ? " " No , never mind , you . " In the middle of his climax , the buttocks-tensing earnestness of it all struck her as extremely funny . She tried to stifle a giggle and dissolved in helpless laughter . She apologized , and for a moment it was touch-and-go whether he would take           under his warm weight , she was asleep again . " Why do n\'t you stay the night ? " Paula came to groggy and grumpy . Inside her he felt like an uninvited finger . " Mm ... that \'s tempting . Jesus , what time is it ? " The blue digits of his clock radio read 11:08 . She thought of checking her office voice mail . Any disasters out there ? " I should probably get home . " " Bagels on the house , " he said , " then you can walk to work . It \'s wet and wild out there . " And it was warm in here . And in the morning she would put on yesterday \'s underwear , and brush her teeth with his toothbrush , and he would still be there . " Then a rain check ? I do n\'t have my makeup or toothbrush . " " I have a spare . I admit I \'m out of lipstick . " " It \'s a nice offer . " " So accept it . " She           " Too spontaneous ? " he asked . " Need time to analyze it ? " " No . " As she covered herself with the wool blanket , irritation prickled her skin . She saw clearly the awkwardness of cream cheese , the false kiss at the door , the stale disorderly day . " I have nothing against spontaneity . I just have a thing about going home at night . " " Maybe I should n\'t have offered . " " No , it \'s sweet of you . " Dressing , she felt his resentful gaze in the darkness . " I want to see if you turn into a pumpkin at midnight . " " Unfortunately , I never stop being me . " " All you want is my body ! \' " Steve imitated female hysteria and pretended to find the reversal amusing . " You never respected me ! \' " Paula was hurrying with her snaps and buttons . There were a hundred things she did n\'t want to know about him , and now that the stuffing was pouring out           a little tramp . " " I like little tramps . " " That must be your problem . " " What \'s your problem , Paula ? Because you clearly have one . " Paula stopped zipping up her skirt . She imagined the sneer on his handsome , preserved face . The hurt pride of demographically spoiled Educated American Male . " You do n\'t know me , " she told him . Steve fell silent . In his bathrobe he showed her to the door . At the touch of the brass knob , Paula suddenly felt dizzy . Vertigo dimmed her vision , and then came the nauseous burning in her throat that she had felt in the conference room when her job had trembled and cracked . She paused in confusion and closed her eyes . " I hope your building gets worked out , " she told him . " Thanks . I hope you do n\'t get downsized . " If they \'d only said this before then things would have gone as always , he would n\'t have asked her to stay           if there would be another Wednesday . To get home she had to take two buses and it was on the second , composing herself against the window and watching the rotten triple-deckers of Prospect Street tilt crazily against the night sky , that Paula understood what had gone wrong . Steve had asked for more than fifty minutes . She knew by heart the reasons why you respected the limit : You got more done in the available time , you both knew what to expect , the encounter remained under control . Pushed , she was ready to bring her authority to bear . Paula lived near Union Square , in an old brick building whose long hallways and broad staircase suggested a boarding house from the Sacco and Vanzetti era . It even had a name , the Narconia , which was never satisfactorily explained to Paula but seemed apt . The Narconia housed a strange collection of tenants : Irish widows , immigrant families from Egypt and Haiti , single mothers on subsidy , pale quiet people working in marginal jobs as paralegals or teaching assistants           gloom of the varnish , the tinny slamming of mailboxes--all of it said that no one in the Narconia was getting anywhere . Paula had moved into this building when she came up from New York , during the late-eighties boom . The Narconia was a temporary solution to the shortage of affordable apartments--a room and a half with a fine view of the Dumpster , a neighborhood of funeral homes and bathtub madonnas behind rosebushes in the tidy front yards of aluminum-siding houses . Her apartment never fully shed its odor of fried potatoes and lemon-scented air freshener . But Paula painted the woodwork white and replaced the yellowing curtains with bamboo blinds . Six years later it was still home . Her key was hardly in the lock when the next door flew open . Mary \'s face , sagging from the dozen children who never visited , peered out . Scandal was magnified in her eyes by plastic glasses that reminded Paula of Gladys Dill \'s missing lens . " Paula dear , thank God you come home . The super and his wife been fighting all           catching her death outside in nothing but her nightie and Bud \'s been smashing the kitchenware and watching violence on TV . " Paula sighed . " What am I supposed to do about it ? " This checked Mary \'s titillated panic . " I just thought since you come home , and you work with them crazies and all--I \'d go out myself only I ai n\'t dressed and she do n\'t like me anyway because I \'m friends with Colleen in Number 17 . " Paula withdrew her key . It was probably her own fault that people assumed she was willing to solve every problem , but at the moment it made her want to smash some kitchenware herself . Passing the super \'s apartment , she smelled beer and dead ash from under the door . The TV was on--a woman was screaming . Around the side of the building the super \'s wife , barefoot on an upturned cinder block , was leaning over the Dumpster and rummaging furiously . Bags were torn , bottles smashed . Linda \'s nightgown , which Bud might           the tops of her thighs . As she disappeared over the side , a red bottom came into view . Paula recoiled . " Who the fuck is no use around here , you useless fuck ? " The voice was headless , as if the Dumpster itself were drunk and rebellious . " Linda ? " " What ! " " Are you looking for something ? " " He threw my fucking prescription away ! " " What prescription ? " " Mine . " Levering herself up on her belly , the super \'s wife confronted her questioner . In their only previous conversation they had discussed a washing machine that was prone to overflowing ; Linda had seemed simple and sweet . " Ca n\'t your doctor write another ? " " He says he wo n\'t ! " Linda began to weep . Her face twisted with shameless , childlike sobs . " It \'s cold , and it \'s starting to rain again . " " But I need it ! " Linda looked at the Dumpster . " He \'ll steal it ,           down inside . " Linda , I \'m afraid you \'ll fall in . " " Good , they can haul me away . " " Can you tell me what the prescription was for ? " " None of your fucking business ! " " Fine . " Tired and cold , Paula had had enough . It might be tragic , but it was also a pain . With a strange feeling of satisfaction she went back inside . That was how it was done : The super \'s wife had told her to fuck off , and she had told the super \'s wife to fuck off . They had both connected with their feelings and gotten admirably to the point , using a minimum of jargon . It felt like her first real human contact of the day . Mary was by her door , wringing the knot of her bathrobe . " What are you going to do ? " " If Linda wants to freeze in a Dumpster that \'s her business . " Paula \'s answering machine carried a message from her mother--a           neighbor who had complained that she was playing an Edith Piaf CD too loud . In the oldest corner of her being , Paula felt a flutter of panic . Too late to call . She told herself that her mother would survive until morning . Mercifully , nothing on her voice mail at the Problem Place . She sat on the edge of the tub while hot water steamed around her naked body . Half-dozing , she entertained the notion that the super \'s wife had shown her the same truth she had just learned with Steve . That she really did n\'t care . About anyone . But it was supposed to be her business to care . For fifty minutes and a modest fee , within the rules . She was a fraud . Paula imagined a man standing beside her in the bathroom , stroking her shoulder , telling her to stop being so hard on herself . In the bath she scrubbed with her coarse sponge and the water darkened . She rid herself of the day \'s involvements so that she might sleep straight           and shiny to go back into the fray . Because it was her contribution . She was good at it , they told her so , the ones who knew . In a murmur that she once used as a girl for prayer , Paula vowed to make Gladys Dill better , stronger , happier . She walked in her kimono through her room and a half , absently tidying up . At the sight of the clutter on her table , sadness came over her . She took a muscle relaxant and turned on the radio . A novelist was being interviewed . She switched to music , then turned it off . The radiator was clanking to life . As she lay on the covers , Steve \'s doorknob flashed through her mind and she became dizzy again . She had tricked herself . What she had felt at his door was n\'t relief at all . Fine said she needed something--he had a way of drilling into her brain . Weekly meetings with strangers ? What she needed did n\'t come in groups . But she would           own good . Because a lover was n\'t a client . Lovers loved . The thought of not going back frightened her , but she would do this ; it would be decisive , like leaving Linda outside . Paula switched off the light and lifted the blinds . Down the alley the Dumpster huddled in a dark mass , but the super \'s wife was nowhere to be seen . \n Chapter One Extreme Sweets The dog wakes up from a dream at the same time I do . His whimpering wakes me , so I pet his nose to calm him . We were both dreaming about cats . I dreamed that my cat had six kittens , each one a color of the rainbow . The purple one was pastel , the same lavender as the Horse of a Different Color in The Wizard of Oz movie . I looked down to see if I was wearing ruby slippers , but I was n\'t . My dog was dreaming of eating cat food . Most of his dreams are about stealing food from other animals . When his paws twitch , that means in his dream he just grabbed some meat and is trying to outrun a pack of vicious , hungry dogs . One time , when he and I were having the same dream , the dogs were faster than him , and I watched them catch up and rip him apart . I woke up crying . I wonder where you go when you die , but mostly I wonder how it affects you when           Are you dying a little each time ? Your whole life , you \'re dying , but I try not to think of it that way . My cousin Laura collects glass animals . She dusts them like forty times per day . When I go over to her house , she constantly glances over to her armoire , making sure her animals are safe . " What \'s new ? " I ask her . " Nothing , " she says . " Like a soda ? " I ask , tossing her a can . " Thanks , " she says , setting it on the table . " Want to go to the beach ? " I ask . " Ca n\'t , " she says . " I \'ll burn . " " Use sunscreen , " I say . " Maybe we \'ll see dolphins . " She walks over to her shelves and picks up her dolphin . She steams it up with her breath , and polishes it with a diaper cloth . " Already got one , " she says . "           so melodramatic . " " You \'re melodramatic , coming over here , all beached up and ready to party . " " What ? " I say . " FYI , I \'m trying to cheer you up and get you into the sun . " " I get plenty of light , " Laura says . " I got these natural lightbulbs on eBay ... " " Fuck eBay , " I say , then storm out . I really do n\'t know what \'s wrong with Laura . She buys and sells animal figurines on eBay so she does n\'t have to leave her house . We did n\'t grow up together . But she \'s one of my only relatives . Her mom and my mom are enemies . Laura and I are the same age . She has long brown hair , nice skin and teeth , and she keeps her nails painted . Sometimes when I go over to her house she \'s in this white gauze gown that looks like it \'s from Victorian times . I \'m sure it \'s from eBay           wear cutoffs , and I keep my nails short so they do n\'t get too much dirt under them . Riding my bike rules my life . I ride my bike around , racing past bums who push shopping carts and ladies who wheel sacks of laundry to the laundromat . Yesterday I saw a lady balancing a box of mangos on her head . My mom and her sister are enemies because my mom found out that my aunt knew my dad was sick before he died , but she did n\'t tell anyone . Dad died ten years ago . My mom feels my aunt was partially responsible for my father \'s death , and my aunt swears that he made her promise not to tell anyone , because he knew he was sick and he would \'ve died anyway . He did n\'t want everybody worrying about him . But my mom says that does n\'t matter , when a man is dying and he does n\'t want his wife and kids to know , you tell them anyway . I agree . Not that she killed           awake trying to convince myself that my aunt was n\'t a murderer . She did n\'t stab him or shoot him , but she secretly knew he was dying and did n\'t do a thing to change it . That \'s pretty close to murder . * * * In the middle of the night , my dog and I share candy on the couch . He sits next to me with his paws crossed , staring at my bag of taffy . He \'s like , I \'ll eat it all even if I have to barf it up after . He \'s like , Go For It . He likes the lime ones ; lime is my least favorite . He freaks on sweets . I know it \'s bad to feed him donuts and Jujubes , but I ca n\'t resist . He lives for this . It makes me feel like we \'re both living our dreams . Sporty , like Extreme Dreaming ! I imagine myself being interviewed on network television : " I \'m just doing the best I can , shedding a little           of slogans , holding my Bit-O-Honey . It \'s like , you have dreams , night after night , for years on end , they do n\'t make any sense , you wake up , and fuck it-you give your dog a little candy to cheer yourself up . Is that so bad ? I mean , is it ? I could be thinking of ways to sabotage my will-o \' -the-wisp cousin , but no . I just eat candy . The night after the lavender cat , Laura and I are riding through the sky in a glass elevator , a modern one , not like Willie Wonka \'s . All four sides of this elevator are made of windows that you can roll down , and the strangers riding with us are hanging out , smoking cigarettes over the edges . I think of what Charlie says in the book-It \'s eerie and frightening to be standing on clear glass high up in the sky . It makes you feel that you are n\'t standing on anything at all . The sky feels underwater-same blue-and the elevator           just as surprising to see a hammerhead shark swim past as it is to see this red-tailed hawk flying below the smokers . Things speeding by , like in the tornado before Oz-a cow , a witch on a bike , trees with roots hanging down . Instead though , a hawk and cigarette butts . Laura shouts , " Come stand on the edge . " " Why do n\'t you stand on the edge ? " Laura lights up , and the smoke wafts into my face . " Blow it out the window , " I tell her . As if there are n\'t windows all around us . She leans over and whispers , " You know , you could die up here and I would n\'t tell anyone . " She gets ready to push me over . I wake up knowing that if I stayed asleep , I would \'ve died . Basically , I just saved my own life . Ha ! I think , in the darkness . You ca n\'t kill me ! This applies less to my twisted cousin than           bed and into the kitchen , where I pour myself a glass of chocolate milk and drink it in the light of the fridge . It \'s the ultimate chocolate milk commercial-Narrowly escaping death , she reaches for the only thing that can satisfy , Milk ! Next day I go to Disneyland . I feel guilty for leaving the dog home alone all day . " I \'ll bring you a treat , " I tell him , as I pet his head and pull the front door shut . " He \'ll be fine , " my friend Lois says , putting her sunglasses on . She \'s an optimist . " Once you ride Space Mountain you \'ll forget all about him . " " That \'s true , " I say , wondering what Laura \'s doing . I decided yesterday to stop inviting her out , which also contributes to my guilt . I know from past experience how much it sucks to feel guilty at Disneyland . You \'re twirling in a teacup at sunset remembering you told your mom you \'d cook her           a pay phone to call and apologize , but you did n\'t bring her phone number with you . Harsh . The Haunted House reminds me of Laura , the painting of the beautiful young girl that morphs into an old hag with snakes in her hair . " That looks like my cousin , " I say to Lois . " Or you , " she jokes . " Shut up , " I say , elbowing her . Still , it \'s uncanny . " It \'s a ride , not a funeral , " Lois says . I remember the glass elevator . " Do n\'t you love Willie Wonka ? " I ask Lois . " We \'re at Disneyland , " Lois says . " Wrong fantasy . " " Let \'s get candy , " I say . When we exit the mansion , we head straight for the stand where I chomp on chocolate turtles and candy canes . I buy a Mickey Mouse Pixy Stix for the dog , after I picture his nose dusted with the sugar powder . So cute-canine           gumdrops . All I can think about is death . Laura , I \'m convinced , is trying to kill me with her mind . " I think my cousin \'s psychic , " I say . " What ? " Lois says . " Last night , in my dream , Laura was trying to kill me , " I explain . " She sits at home all day , tripping out on eBay ... I feel like right now she \'s sending me evil vibes . " " No more candy for you , " Lois says . " Anyways , you ca n\'t die from dreaming about death . " " But she could be willing my demise , " I say . " Voodoo . " " Look , Laura might shop too much on eBay , but that does n\'t make her a Voodoo priestess , " Lois says . " That \'s , like , from a bad horror movie . " " We \'ll see , " I say . " I better start sleeping with Snickers under my pillow . When I           " " There \'s plenty of candy in heaven , " Lois says . Lois was right : I did eat too much candy at Disneyland . That night my dreams were a mess . I breast-fed a hippo . An albino man with glass teeth stalked me ; every time I turned around he was Windexing his grin . My dog spoke backwards , telling me that he needed to be brushed . Hsurb em , he said . What \'s worse , the glass-toothed man finally cornered me at a party , bit my arm with his jagged fangs , and I bled to death while everyone stood around drinking beer . But Laura was n\'t responsible . She had her chance to get in there and damage me , while I was trapped in my sugary nightmares , but instead she stayed up all night haggling , pale-faced in her computer screen \'s glow . ( Continues ... ) \n Mary Todd Lexington , Kentucky I HAVE LONG SINCE learned not to believe idle stories . Heaven knows I grew up on them . For years as a child I was terrorized by family stories of great Uncle John being killed at Blue Licks by Indians . Or how Uncle John escaped from Indians after running a gauntlet and his brother Sam was captured and Uncle John ransomed him for a barrel of whiskey . Not to mention Mammy Sally \'s stories about Jaybird reporting once a week to the Almighty about our misdoings for which , somehow , we \'d be punished . Jaybird reported only to God , she said . But for some reason I did believe the rumor told to me by my sisters Frances and Elizabeth of how , only weeks after our mother \'s burial , our father was courting another woman . I believe it because my older sisters were friends with Dr. Warfield \'s daughter , Claire . And he \'d been in attendance at my mother \'s death and was a friend of my father . They tell me this woman is from Frankfort , the state capital where my           They say she has a seventy-three-year-old mother who is the head of society there . That she herself wants to be called Betsy , and that she hopes to lift our family tonew standards of elegance . Grandmother Parker , who lives just up the hill from us here in Lexington and is my own mother \'s ma , says it is an indecently short time after Ma \'s death for Pa to go courting . My sister Frances says Pa sent his new lady a miniature of himself painted by Lexington \'s own Matthew Jouett . Elizabeth Humphreys she is called . I made it my business to find out everything I could about her . She is no stranger to Lexington . Two of her uncles taught here at our Transylvania college . She is going to bring her own black servants with her when she comes . I wonder how that will sit with Mammy Sally . Jaybird can tell God all he wants about me . I know already that I do not like her . IT WAS IN THE AIR a long time , this           sister , who ran the household since Ma died , warned us not to ask him about it . So we did n\'t . But we watched him closely at the dinner table to see if he was changing toward us . For all we could see , he was n\'t . He still asked Levi if he \'d been a good boy that day and ruffled his hair when he asked it . He still told my spoiled sister Ann how pretty she was . He still discussed social matters with Elizabeth and Frances . And he still promised me a pony if I was a good girl . He \'d been promising me a pony for ages . As long as he kept promising , I figured my hope for a pony was still alive . Though I did wonder if a pony would fit in with Betsy \'s idea of a new standard of elegance . No , he was n\'t changing toward us . He was still Pa , who loved us and would n\'t let anything come between us . SOMETIME AROUND CHRISTMAS in 1825           dinner and cleared up the rumors . I was seven years old . " My situation has become irksome , " he said . " People of ill will are saying bad things about me and my intended , Elizabeth Humphreys . So I have become engaged to this dear lady and hope soon to wed . I need to complete my domestic circle so I can enjoy the repose and happiness which the world can never give . " Pa talked high words sometimes . But we understood . Frances and Elizabeth kissed him . I hugged him because I was n\'t going to be left out of any part of his domestic circle . THAT \'S HOW WE LEARNED we were to get a stepmother . But I did n\'t see the need for one . As far as I was concerned , the domestic circle we had was complete enough . Mammy Sally ran the kitchen and the other servants . And I did n\'t see anything wrong with Auntie Ann running the house . She even did the male chores when Pa was away , oversaw           staples . Only bone I had to pick with her was that she favored my little sister Ann too much . Ann was the darling of her eye . I was almost eight the year Pa wed and Ann was going on two , and Ann took all the attention from me . Same as she \'d taken my name when she was born . I was Mary Ann up until then , until they gave the second part of my name to her , and now I \'m only Mary . It \'s a lonely name , I can tell you . It needs a second part . Anybody can see that . Elizabeth and Frances have their own set of fine-feathered girlfriends who ca n\'t talk about anything but dresses and boys . Levi , a year older than me , and George , only one at the time , had the full attention and love of Pa . All I had was Grandma Parker to stand up for me . And she was fifty-two . I HAVE HAD A LOT of afflictions in my life , do           them . Now that I am nineteen and about to leave Lexington , Kentucky , to live with my sister Elizabeth and her husband in Springfield , Illinois , I can write of them without hurting too much . Before I was three years old I lost my place as the youngest in the family to brother Robert when he was born . When I was four I lost my baby brother . Robert died at fourteen months . I was uncommonly fond of Robert and his death affected me terribly . Then when I was five I lost part of my name . At seven I lost my mother when my next brother , George Rogers Clark Todd , was born . At almost eight I got a new stepmother . WE WERE TO CALL her " Ma " Pa told us in one of the most stern moments I ever recollect seeing him in . " Not Betsy , but Ma . " We all said yes . " And if you have any concerns about the household , bring them to her . She wants to be           \'d had nothing but concerns since Auntie Ann had left us , as soon as Pa and Betsy came home from their wedding trip . Concerns about the household ? That phrase went through my mind as I stood in the kitchen and watched , transfixed , as Judy , one of Betsy \'s slaves , stood grim-faced , her two hands holding a large bowl of soup . I could smell the soup from where I stood . I loved that soup , all made with preserves from our garden . Across the kitchen stood Mammy Sally , who had made the soup . She \'d caught Judy sampling it from the serving bowl and scolded her . " Here , take your ol \' soup , " Judy said and threw the bowl on the floor . The smash of the china bowl sounded throughout the house . The soup splashed all over the place . I even got some on the hem of my dress . Mammy Sally backed away , held her hands to her face , and cried . " Who wants your ol \'           then Pa appeared at the kitchen doorway . " What is this ? What \'s going on here ? " " Judy threw the soup on the floor , " I told him . He looked shocked . I felt sorry for him . So much for repose and happiness , I thought . And , as if he could read my thoughts , he looked at me . " Mary , go and get your mother , " he said quietly . Then he turned and went back into his study . For a moment I thought that he really meant my mother . The look on his face was so confused that for all I knew he could have been wanting her then , just like I was . But I ran upstairs to get Betsy . She was seated at her dressing table , making up her hair . " What \'s all the noise ? " she asked . I just stood there like a jackass in the rain . " Ma , " my voice cracked when I said it . " The servants are           . " " And why is that ? " " Judy threw it on the floor . " " Well , she must have had provocation . " So that was the way it was to be . Her servants could do no wrong . " Pa needs you , " I said . She stood up . " Is there no order in this house ? " I shrugged . " Your Judy threw the soup when Mammy Sally found her eating out of the serving bowl . " " There must be more to it than that . " New standards of elegance , I thought . " And you do n\'t have to look so pained when you call me Ma , either . Now say it again . And say it strong . " I swallowed . " Ma , " I said . " Again . " Tears came to my eyes . " Ma . " She swept past me . " I hope I do n\'t have to speak to your father about you . Now go and tell the others to come           by any means , electronic or mechanical , including photocopy , recording , or any information storage and retrieval system , without permission in writing from the publisher . \n Shafts of golden light pierced the green twilight , penetrating the waving fronds of the forest to leave pools of light on the ground . The path to the Great Palace , paved with pearl shell , unraveled along the sand ; a broad ribbon of iridescence , suddenly burning into a patch of blinding white when one of those shafts touched it . On either side of the path , at charm-ingly irregular intervals , stands of long , waving kelp , beds of colorful anemones , and coral " bushes " were being carefully tended by a small horde of tiny sea creatures . No one ever actually set foot on the path , or truly even needed to use it . This was , after all , the bottom of the sea . People swam . Even the few two-legged people , like the Sea King \'s children , swam . Nevertheless there was a path , winding through a " forest , " though the forest was kelp , the " birds " were fish , and even the " hawks " had an analogue in the form of sharks and other predators . There           palace . The Tradition said that all palaces should have winding paths trav-eling through mysterious forests filled with enchanting wildlife . So this Palace , although underwater , had such a path . In many ways , it was a good thing that no one ever actually walked on the path . Pearl shell , while pretty , had very sharp edges , and no one down here wore shoes . And that , Ekaterina , the youngest daughter of the Sea King , reflected , as she swam in adeceptively languid manner toward the palace , was a pity . Katya loved shoes . Dainty , embroidered silk slippers . Thigh-high leather boots . Strange wooden things that were like walking with tiny tables strapped to one \'s feet . Dancing shoes , red-heeled shoes , shoes that were hardly more than thin little straps , shoes that were substantial enough to pound a nail with . She loved them all . In fact , she loved clothing . She adored clothing . It did n\'t matter what the style , the fashion was , she loved clothing the           no one wore clothing , or at least much that was like clothing , down here . As a warrior in her father \'s Personal Guard , she wore her fish-scale armor of course . In fact , she was wearing it now , since she had been summoned for official business . It was as pretty as she could engineer , despite being first , and foremost , very func-tional . The fish scales glittered in the errant beams of sunlight filtering down through the kelp branches . It was the same pearly white as the shells beneath her , and gleamed with the same iridescence . The scales of the formfitting tunic were about the size of her thumbnail , while those on the sleeves of the tunic and the equally formfitting leggings were much , much smaller , about the size of the nail of a baby \'s littlest finger . Her sharkskin boots were a dead white , matching the shark-skin belt and gloves . The belt held nothing at the moment . No sword , no knives . But Ekaterina did n\'t need a weapon           bound up into a severe knot , another pity . She had lovely hair , as pearl-white as the shell also , and the fact that living under the sea allowed only two basic hair-styles--severe knot , or floating free--was another source of private regret for her . Small wonder she welcomed her father \'s regular summons . Hopefully this would be another trip to Dry Land ! Even better if it was to a new bit of Dry Land , a place she had never been before ! That would be glorious ! The nearer she came to the Palace of the Sea King , the more people she encountered , though most of them were dolphins and the smaller whales , who served as her father \'s Palace Guard . You could always tell a Guard creature from the fluke studs denoting rank ; small gold or silver rounds much like earrings , and put in the same way . She always winced at a fluke-piercing , though the cetaceans were quite proud of enduring the pain . She supposed it must be like islanders \' tattoos .           pain of their decorations . There were a few mer-folk as well ; a couple of the mermaids of her mother \'s Court , sitting , gossiping , and combing their hair . Mermaids did that a great deal . Part of it was because when your hair was long and floating free in the water and you did n\'t have two dozen little cleaner-shrimp to keep it disentangled and sorted the way the Queen did , it got knots very easily . But part of it was The Tradition , which said very clearly that mermaids spent a lot of time combing their hair , sitting on rocks and singing , or both . Her father had managed to put an end to the part of The Tradition that had once made them sit on rocks and sing sailors to their doom--now they only en-chanted the poor lads so that they forgot their One True Loves , at least until the One True Loves managed to break the spell . Her father was clever that way . He had n\'t wanted sailors with their ears stopped up with wax           \'d been the Sea Prince , he \'d gotten hold of half a dozen very good bards and paid them generously to write songs on the new theme . It had taken several years of concen-trated effort , spreading the songs , singing them in contests , even introducing very elegant versions into several nearby Royal Courts , but the effort had paid off handsomely . Now the only sea creatures that lured sailors to their doom were the Sirens , and they did n\'t acknowledge her father \'s authority , claiming to be descended from gods . So the Sirens could handle the odd clever hero with murderous intent on their own . Katya reflected that her father really was one of the clever-est Sea Kings of his line . He was n\'t the only King of the Sea , of course ; for one thing , the sea was twice as big as the Dry Land , and it would be absurd to think that one person could govern all of it . But he was certainly one of the cleverest of those cur-rently ruling . As a           Tradition shaped the lives of everything , and had determined that it would no longer be The Tradition that con-trolled the lives of his family and his people , but the other way around . To that end he had studied as much about it as he could , certainly as much as many Godmothers , and had educated his subjects in how it worked as well . But when you were a magical creature , as the peoples of the sea generally were , The Tradition had a tendency to shove you about more ruthlessly than any mortal . Unless you knew how to do a little preemptive shoving of your own . As Katya swam past the coral garden , she caught sight of her sister Tasha with her nose buried in a book , her back cradled by an enormous sea fan . There were no Godmothers for the sea creatures ; evidently only mortals got the services of such cleverly manipulative creatures--but the Sea King was doing the next best thing to getting one . He was training his very own Sorceress . Now , all           few--had positions of real authority or meaningful jobs . He had told Ekaterina once that this was the way to make sure none of his offspring " went to the bad . " " Everyone needs to have respon-sibility , " he had told her . " The cleverer you are , the more re-sponsibility you need . Nothing breeds discontent like idleness . " Tasha was one of the cleverest of his daughters , and she had a real aptitude for magic . Not that Katya envied her the special tutors , the tower of her own , and all the special considerations . Not once it had become obvious that Tasha was never going to leave the Palace grounds again . Not that Tasha cared . That was the genius of the Sea King ; his children were all considered and studied as carefully as any sculptor would study a block of stone , and then positions were created for them that suited not only their talents , but their ap-titudes , and not only their aptitudes , but their desires . Katya had enough wanderlust for twenty           sleeping in strange beds , eating strange foods , and wearing strange clothing . Oh yes . Especially wearing strange clothing . Tasha did not even notice as her sister swam past . But then , it would take the eruption of a volcano beneath her feet to get Tasha out of a book of magical theory once she was deeply en-grossed . Such ability to concentrate was invaluable to a Sorce-ress , whose life might well depend on being able to carry out every step of a complicated ritual while an Evil Mage was throwing everything he had in the way of an attack at her head . Now , Mischa , the Crown Prince , would not dare to allow his mind to be so focused . A King--or a Prince in line for the throne--needed to be able to divide his attention among a dozen or more things at once , and change from task to task on an instant , exactly like a juggler keeping a complicated number of balls in the air at once . Mischa was superbly suited for such a thing , to           Prince Mikael the Clever . " That was a talent he shared with Ekaterina , though the throne was absolutely the last thing she wanted . Ever . Not all the lovely dresses in the world and the ability to wear them underwater could have bribed her to take the throne . The kelp forest abruptly gave way to open sand , and the Palace rose up before her in all its splendor . A dazzling ray of sun pierced through the surface of the ocean far above , and bathed the intricate spires and delicate towers in green-tinted glory . It looked for all the world as if nature had conspired to put that shaft of sunlight right there--And of course , Katya knew very well that it had . Here again was the hand of The Tradition at work . The Tra-dition decreed that the first sight of the Sea King \'s Palace should be of it bathed in a shaft of sunlight piercing the depths . So , of course , it was . All the time--well , all the daylight time at any rate . By           any strength , it was bathed in moonlight . As a child , Ekaterina had taken particular and mildly mischievous delight in dragging visitors through the kelp forest on wretched and stormy days just to see that shaft of sunlight break through the clouds in time to perform its magic . The walls were made of pink coral , carved and polished to a soft glow . Beautiful patterns had been inlaid around each window in mother-of-pearl , black and red coral . Unlike the fortress-palaces of Rus , this place could not possibly withstand a siege , or even the attack of a child with a sling and a stone . There looked to be two dozen spiral spires , like the long and delicately pointed seashells or a narwhal \'s horn , and half again as many filigree towers . In fact there were twenty-one spires and nine towers , each of them the private domain of someone in the Royal Family . Not just the King and Queen and their brood , but the Dowager Queen , and several assorted Aunts and Uncles . Whenever another family           available for them , another was created . This was n\'t just whim or fancy . This was , after all , the sea , and such an arrangement made it possible for the Royals to come and go as they liked without having to pass through the rest of the Palace . When you lived at the bottom of the sea , an exit was as easy as swimming out your window , and the towers gave discreet points from which to do so . No doubt many Royals in the past had taken such exits to have adventures--or even to meet with a paramour they had rather their spouses did n\'t know about . To Katya \'s immediate right , the parade grounds , which just now were empty , but often as not held her brother Mischa as he drilled his troops . For the most part , the Sea King \'s troops were ranged in " battles " that had very little to do with war . There were monsters in the sea , enormous behemoths that came with ravening appetites for which a whale was           When they appeared , they had to either be killed or driven away , and it took strong creatures armed to the teeth to do so . Mischa thrived on combat , hence his position as the Commander of all of the Sea King \'s forces . And though the army was a small one , it was formidable , for Mischa employed magicians alongside the armsmen , training the two to work together as a seamless whole . To Ekaterina \'s certain--and it was very certain--knowledge , no one else in the sea kingdoms did such a thing . As a consequence , it was vanishingly unlikely that any attempt to take this kingdom by force would succeed . \n Chapter One NEW YORK CITY September 8 Laurel Kingsford flinched when the door of her office banged open and Jerry Garcone cruised in . The wisp of concept she \'d flirted with all morning , the breakthrough solution to one of the most difficult problems her design team faced , disappeared from her mind . She \'d been Jerry \'s mentor in the firm since he came aboard three years earlier . He should know better than to barge in like this by now . " Sorry to disturb you , IQ , but Nick wants to see you in his office ASAP . Want me to tell him you \'ll be up after you powder your nose ? " IQ again . The nickname had settled on her because she was so bright , the guys in the management clique said , but one of the other women on staff had whispered the truth . It stood for " Ice Queen . " " No , I \'ll be along as soon as I can save my work and shut down the system . " It was totally unfair , she was warm and open with everyone ,           , not catch a husband , and she turned down social invitations from male employees , Jerry among them . The nickname had been her reward , and it stuck-even after she and Rob became engaged . Jerry maintained a friendly manner in her presence , but he was too ambitious for his own good . No way would she trust him alone with Nick if she could help it , not when everyone expectedthe new head of the fuel cell project to be named in the next few days . Tom Everett , retired project head , had recommended her as his replacement and rightly so . She had the qualifications : six years in fuel cell engineering , two as team leader , several summers of deep-sea research with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at Woods Hole , and a love of everything nautical . She planned her summer vacations around one NOAA field project or another , and they always invited her back . The job was hers . She was comfortable with that , but experience had taught her the importance of guarding her flanks           the formal announcement ? Jerry peered over her shoulder at her screen . She glared and he stepped back . " Okay , see you up there . " He did n\'t bother to close the door when he left . * * * Five minutes later , Laurel left the elevator on the twenty-fifth floor and entered the reception area outside Nick \'s office . For the past weeks , she \'d taken care to dress more formally , to be ready , if and when the announcement came . Today \'s suit set off her eyes , and did n\'t disguise the fact that she was young and trim , even if in her own mind she was too tall , and her figure less than eye-popping . Nick \'s receptionist smiled . " Go on in , Laurel , they \'re all there . " All ? With a sudden sense of foreboding , Laurel entered the division head \'s office . Opposite the entrance , a bank of windows extended from knee height to the ceiling . Outside , Manhattan enjoyed another warm early September morning           room and he stood when she entered . Marianne , Laurel \'s friend and head of the Propulsion Project , was present too , and so was Jerry Garcone . Jerry wore a suit she had n\'t seen before , of very good cloth . She had n\'t noticed downstairs . He wore it well , along with a huge grin . Beside him , Marianne did not look happy . Her eyes flashed a warning . " Ms. Kingsford . Good . Come in , please . " Laurel \'s sensors went to full alert . Nick always called her by her nickname . He came around the desk and offered his hand . He was tall and fair-skinned , with curly black hair and wide blue eyes . His outward demeanor was open as they shook hands . Nick went to the windows , where he looked out for several seconds . Then he moved back behind his desk . He did n\'t sit , or invite anyone else to . " I did n\'t expect you to get up here so quickly , Ms. Kingsford , but           hear it from me . " He shuffled papers on his desk while he shifted from foot to foot then looked up at her . " I \'ve just accepted Marianne \'s resignation as Propulsion Project manager ... " His eyes were unreadable as they bored into Laurel \'s . When she did not react , he went on . " We \'ve named Jerry Garcone to replace Tom Everett as head of the fuel cell project . Management decided a fresh approach , a new attitude , would be good for the department . " Laurel was struck mute . They could n\'t leapfrog Jerry over her . She was senior on the design team , practically carrying the whole project on her shoulders . Jerry did n\'t have a prayer of handling the job . Had Marianne quit over the news ? Until now , she \'d been the only woman in a leadership position in the company , and Laurel \'s strongest ally . " But ... I thought ... " she tried , but the words would n\'t come . Nick seemed emboldened by her confusion           , hon , but we felt the program would be more stable with a ... with Jerry \'s hand on the tiller . " He stepped around to her , seemed genuinely sorry to have to deliver the news , and placed his hand on her shoulder . " You \'re a great asset for us . I just hope you can see your way to working under Jerry . We need you to keep producing the same high-quality work you have all along . " The truth came with his choice of words , the way he \'d been about to say " a man \'s hand on the tiller . " A heat began in Laurel \'s neck and rose upward over her face . Marianne out . The ally she \'d counted on . It was all lost . How could she face the other team members , the other female employees ? She trembled , shook his hand from her shoulder and stalked out the door , her body stiff and shuddering . " Laurel , wait ! " Marianne called . " Do n\'t ...           fought back tears only until she reached her office . When the door closed behind her , the dam burst and tears flowed so thick she stopped trying to wipe them away . Tears of indignation , not sorrow ; resentment , not remorse . She booted her computer . She might cry when things like this happened , but she could still function . They would n\'t get the innovations she \'d conceived for the fuel cell , the ones she \'d anticipated being asked to develop . Technically , they might be the property of Forrester NA , but they could hardly prosecute her for stealing something they had no idea existed . When the system was up , she tapped in her code words and stuck a CD in the drive . Two minutes later she \'d burned the contents of her personal files into the disk . She pulled up the operating system and typed in the instruction , " FORMAT C : " . After assuring the mainframe that she really , really wanted to reformat her hard drive , which would result in the           final " Y " and waited as the routine got under way . Ten minutes later , her hard drive was fresh as a newborn baby . Deleted files ? What deleted files ? Just in time too . Moments after she removed the CD , her system went off and the screen went black . The bastards were making sure she did n\'t do anything irrational while she was angry , like quit and take work papers with her , exactly as she \'d just done . Let that bushwhacker Jerry Garcone stew in his own salsa . All she could think of was getting out of there and getting home to Rob . Rob would know how to help . He would comfort her . She pulled the liner from her wastebasket and emptied its contents on the floor , then cleaned out her desk . When she finished , she pulled her keys , employee ID , parking passes , and even her unused lunch tickets from her purse and threw them on their desk . She \'d given this company the best of herself , her           was a way to make a living . It was much more , a demonstration to them , as well as to herself , of her value as a person . It was exactly eleven forty-five when she left her office , carrying a half-filled trash bag and the disk containing solutions to problems her design team did n\'t know it had yet . Not much to show for six years of hard work , hopes , and dreams . She ignored the stares that escorted her to the exit . There would be other jobs . She \'d quit without notice , so there \'d be no money other than the refund of the retirement contributions she \'d made , but they would manage . * * * Laurel turned the key and pushed the apartment door open . " Hello ! Robbie . I \'m home early , " she called as she entered the hall . Rob had been busy today . He \'d finally picked up the half dozen pairs of footgear he usually kicked off and then abandoned in the entryway . About time .           of belongings on the table . " Are you home , honey ? I \'ve got news . " Well , maybe he had n\'t been so busy after all . The breakfast dishes were still piled in the sink . Maybe he \'d gone out job hunting . That would be good news . She entered the living room , on the way to the bedroom and the first wrong note sounded . The home entertainment center , which included TV , VCR , stereo , CD player and tape deck , was missing . Her hand went to her throat and a chill spread . " Rob ! Rob ! Are you all right ? " She whirled a complete circle . Looking for what ? An intruder ? She ran into the bedroom . " My God ! " The drawers of Rob \'s dresser were on the floor , empty . On the vanity , her jewelry box was open . She went to it and quickly pawed through . She did n\'t have much of value . She sighed with relief . Everything seemed to           her access codes and passwords in-the computers at work , the cable company . She \'d probably neglected to put it back last time she retrieved a forgotten password . A needle of dread lanced her , stealing her breath . She had put it back , she remembered clearly , after recording the codes to access her accounts on line , the ones the bank had just set up two weeks ago . She reached over and booted her computer . In less than a minute she had her accounts on the screen . The funds from her savings account had been moved to her checking account ten days ago . The day after that , a check for virtually her entire balance had been paid to the account of someone named Andrew Pierce . She sat on the unmade bed . The sheets were cold , unwelcoming . Her mind reached for understanding . Rob \'s closet was empty . Everything of his , his guitars , his hobby kits , everything was gone . He \'d betrayed her . She sobbed and fell backward onto the sheets           . The money would be gone . He \'d left her nothing , not even a note to say , " I \'m sorry . " THE TWICE TOLD HOTEL MEXICO POINT Southeastern End of Lake Ontario Those whom God wants to punish for the sin of selfishness , he first makes lonely then curses with long life . Jake Eastland , six generations removed from his Revolutionary War ancestor Joshua , knew from bitter experience how empty such an existence could be . At ninety-three , alive but seeing no reason whatever to be happy about it , he frowned as the arrival of the hotel elevator disturbed his reverie . A moment later the doors opened and Sheik Carroway , longtime manager of the hotel marina and sometime friend , stepped out into the vestibule of Jake \'s penthouse apartment . Sheik waved a registration card . " The desk asked me to bring this up . Only one new guest today , Jake . A young woman . They put her on the second floor . " With a dismissive movement of his fingers , Jake indicated           after Labor Day and he did n\'t much care . A year earlier , at his villa in the Swiss Alps , death had handed him its calling card in the form of a cerebral event . After seventy years out in the world , he had n\'t come back to revamp the hotel \'s business plan . He \'d come home to die . But Death refused to cooperate . Time dragged on . He imagined himself suspended in a kind of living purgatory from which he could not escape until life had exacted retribution for his many failures and misdeeds . One year would not be nearly enough . Sheik , a robust man in his sixties , with a shock of white hair and watery blue eyes , dropped the card on the end table beside Jake \'s chair and crossed the room to the expensive exercise bike near the windows . " The log still says 614 . You do your exercise today ? " " Promise me it \'ll kill me . I \'ll ride till I drop . Otherwise , tell me again why           down in the chair opposite Jake . " Come on , Jake . Do n\'t talk like that . You \'re lucky . You get around good , you still got all your marbles , and you \'re rich as Croeseus . What more do you expect ? Hard-ons ? " Jake \'s mood lightened . He had to suppress a smile . " I own Croeseus . Got him in a trade with the Rogala boys in 1945 . Money is n\'t everything , bub . " " Maybe , but when you do n\'t have any , like me , it \'s a hell of a long way aheada \' whatever comes second . " Sheik threw a worried glance Jake \'s way . " You \'re down again . You been takin \' the happy pills doc gave you ? He \'s gon na be here again tomorrow , you know . He \'ll be pissed if you ai n\'t . That means he \'ll yell at me , not you . " Jake made a face . He \'d thrown out the pills . Nothing to           a zombie , another . He motioned in the direction of the lake . " Any nibbles on the Whaler ? " He \'d amused himself by selling off his personal toys . Only the twenty-two-foot Boston Whaler remained . Sheik nodded . " Oh yeah . Almost forgot . Guy offered twenty-nine for it . I told him I \'d talk to you . It \'s ten thousand under the market , Jake . Three years ago you put twenty-five into new engines alone . " " Tell him I \'ll think it over . " Sheik braced his hands on his knees and pushed himself to his feet . " Okay , Jake . I got ta get back downstairs . Do n\'t forget to ride the bike . Five miles a day . Keep your ticker runnin \' good . " Jake let his gaze rest on the instrument of torture Sheik referred to . Its handlebars obstructed the view from where he sat . He made as if to rise . " Okay . Maybe I \'ll take myself for a spin right now . "           of it , but he went to the elevator without comment . The moment the doors closed , Jake fell back into the armchair , eyeing the remote control of the TV . The numbness of having nothing to do but waste himself watching television came over him , just as it did every day . Eventually , from desperation he \'d turn the thing on . But not yet . The blue of the registration card caught his eye . Reaching , he scooted it closer and flipped it over . Adjusting his glasses so he could see through the reading lens , he held the card to the light . On the first line , the guest had printed her name : Laurel A. Kingsford . Jake \'s heart took off on a run of extra beats and his hand trembled so violently the card slipped from his fingers . Laurel . It could n\'t be that Laurel . It just could n\'t be . * * * Ten hours later , at nearly three in the morning , Jake had yet to sleep . Outside , wind           cast nervous patterns through them onto the ceiling of his bedroom , adding to his wakefulness . Beneath his fingers on the rumpled bed lay the blue registration card of Laurel A. Kingsford . His only living heir . His granddaughter . She thought he was dead . Not surprising , considering that after her mother died and her grandmother took custody , the poor kid spent her formative years tucked away at one boarding school or the other . Hard to learn much about your family when you \'re only allowed to visit on holidays and vacations . By then , he and her grandmother Jean Gamble had been divorced thirty years , and Jean had been through a string of other husbands . Jake \'s chest ached as remembrance , amplified by the shadows fretting on the ceiling , overrode his effort to suppress it . From the very day his daughter Saundra came into the world , he \'d been pushed to the outside of her life . After the divorce from Jean Gamble , she \'d vowed that so far as Saundra was concerned , Jake           good start on the girl . She countered his court orders with her own , fought him to a legal standstill , turned away every attempt he made to visit as the girl came up , all the while filling the child \'s mind with poison . He \'d vowed it would be different with Laurel , but business intervened like it always did . He let things slip , and Jean pulled the same tricks she \'d done with Saundra all over again with Laurel . Before long , he \'d lost his chance with his granddaughter too . ( \n Chapter One At precisely eight forty-five on the second Monday morning in June , Hannah Swensen took a number from the deli-style dispenser mounted on a pole next to the secretary \'s desk and plunked herself down in one of the nondescript chairs in the nondescript waiting room to wait her turn . It was hot and muggy , standard fare for this time of year . While other states boasted of fish that jumped , living that was easy , and cotton that was high , summertime in Minnesota was just the opposite . The muggy heat caused fish to lurk at the bottom of the lake , totally unmoved by even the tastiest bait , and the living was far from easy , especially if you owned a family farm . The corn might be knee high by the Fourth of July , if it was a good year , but the only thing that was high in the second week of June was the humidity . A low rumble made Hannah frown . She hoped the sound came from one of the big trucks she \'d seen delivering carnival rides to the midway and not from           the Tri-County Fair and the gates opened at noon . The coming week would be like a holiday , with hundreds passing through the turnstiles to look at the exhibits , enjoy the rides on the midway , and attend the rodeo that was held every afternoon . Hannah brushed several orange cat hairs from her tan slacks . They landed on the seat of the orange plastic chair next to her . Although she vacuumed every weekend , it was a losing battle . Her orange and white tomcat , Moishe , contributed twice as much hair as she collected in the bag of her vacuum . There were times when Hannah seriously considered installing an orange and white carpet , buying orange and white furniture , and eating only orange and white food during the shedding season . It would n\'t cut down on the cat hair , but it would be camouflaged . At least she would n\'t be aware of how many strands she was walking on , sitting on , and ingesting . This type of chair would work . Hannah could n\'t even see           time in a chair like this was something to be avoided . It was a clone to every other molded plastic chair in every other waiting room in the state . Perhaps it was true that form followed function , but in this case it was horribly uncomfortable and as ugly as sin . Rather than glance at her watch for the third time in as many minutes , Hannah thought about why so many businesses bought these chairs for their waiting rooms . The plastic was impervious to spills and scratches , and they did add a splash of color to an otherwise drab room . The chairs were bolted to rails that conjoined them as sextuplets . Hannah supposed that this was meant to discourage theft , but she seriously doubted that anyone would want to steal them anyway . Sitting up straight did n\'t help to relieve the strain on her back , so Hannah tried slouching . That was even worse . A little notice stamped on the back of the chair in front of her said that it had been designed to fit the average           anybody truly average ? Average was a statistical tool that took tall people over six feet , added them to short people under five feet , and came up with an average of five and a half feet . Hannah knew from bitter experience not to buy slacks marked average . They were too short for tall people and too long for short people . Perhaps somewhere there might be a handful of people the slacks would fit , but Hannah had never met them . And if these chairs were designed for an average body , it was clear that the model the manufacturer had used bore little resemblance to Hannah . Looking around her , Hannah suspected that she was n\'t alone . Everyone who was waiting to see the secretary at the Tri-County Fairgrounds looked just as uncomfortable as she did . " Swensen ? " the secretary called out , and Hannah walked over to take the seat in front of the secretary \'s desk that had been recently vacated by a man in work clothes and a hardhat . " I need some information from           waited while the woman opened a drawer and pulled out a book of bound and printed forms . She flipped it open , retrieved her pen , and looked up at Hannah . " Your full name please ? " " Hannah Louise Swensen . " " Marital status ? " " Single . " " Age ? " " Thirty . " Hannah gave a little sigh . This was June and her thirty-first birthday was in July . When did a woman become a spinster ? Had it happened last year when she hit thirty ? Or would the women \'s movement grant her a reprieve so she would n\'t enter the old maid \'s category until she reached forty ? This was a question she could ponder by herself , but she certainly would n\'t discuss it with her mother ! Delores Swensen was n\'t reticent about reminding her eldest daughter that her biological clock was ticking . " Street address ? " " Forty-six thirty-seven Maytime Lane , " Hannah replied , smiling a bit as she gave the address of her condo complex . Maybe           and business . " City and state ? " " Lake Eden , Minnesota . " " And your reason for applying for a pass ? " As usual , she \'d probably bit off more than she could chew . But what else could she have done when Pam Baxter , the Jordan High Home Economics teacher , had called her in a panic at six o\'clock this morning to say that Edna Ferguson had been taken to Lake Eden Memorial Hospital for an emergency appendectomy ? Pam had practically begged Hannah to fill in on the judging panel , and of course she \'d agreed . " I \'m a last-minute replacement on the panel to judge the baked goods at the Creative Arts Building , " she said . " Lucky you ! " The secretary looked up with a smile that instantly humanized her . " Really ? " " You \'d better believe it ! That \'s a job I would n\'t mind having . I love desserts and I need to lose a few pounds . " Hannah blinked . " You want to           a few pounds ? " " That \'s right . My aunt lost thirty pounds when she took a job at a chocolate factory . They let her eat all the candy she wanted , and after the first couple of days , she stopped eating it . She \'s been retired for ten years , and she still ca n\'t stand the sight of chocolate . " " That would n\'t work for me , " Hannah told her . " How do you know ? " " I own a bakery and I still love desserts . " The secretary sighed as she handed Hannah her pass . " It probably would n\'t work for me , either . Say ... is your bakery called The Cookie Jar ? " " That \'s right . " " Then I \'m almost positive you \'re going to win blue ! " " Blue ? " " A blue ribbon . I do n\'t mean you personally , but the man who took your picture for the photography exhibit . I saw it last night and it \'s the best           five minutes later , Hannah was staring at the entry that the secretary thought would take first place in the photography exhibit . It was a candid picture , she had n\'t even realized it was being taken , and it was undoubtedly the most flattering photo anyone had ever taken of her . Hannah felt the smile begin in her mind , spread out to her face , and flow right on down to the soles of her feet . She felt as if she were smiling all over as she gazed at the photo . It was a wonderful picture , and she could hardly believe that she was the subject ! First of all , her hair was n\'t sticking up in wiry curls the way it usually did , and it looked more auburn than red . And if that were n\'t enough to please her , she appeared at least ten pounds thinner than she actually was . Both of her eyes were open , her pose was n\'t awkward or contrived , and the half-smile on her lips was intriguing . This photo was           who could make her look good deserved a blue ribbon and then some ! Norman Rhodes had taken it , of course . Hannah \'s sometimes boyfriend divided his time between his vocation of dentistry , his avocation of photography , and his habit of being a prince of a guy Hannah knew she should probably marry . Unfortunately , she could n\'t seem to do it , even though her mind told her it was the smart choice . She \'d come to the conclusion that she simply was n\'t ready for marriage , and reminders from her mother about biological clocks should n\'t force her into walking down the aisle until the time was right for her . Hannah shook herself mentally and glanced at her watch . It was nine-thirty and she had to meet Pam and her teacher \'s assistant , Willa Sunquist , at ten . She did n\'t have time to think about marriage now . She turned her attention back to the photograph . It was huge , two feet by three feet , and Norman had taken it at The Cookie Jar           in the mirror behind the counter , and that must be the way the secretary had recognized her . Hannah was standing behind the counter , looking off into the distance , and there was a very loving , almost beatific expression on her face . It was clear she was thinking about someone or something she loved , and Hannah wished she could remember who or what it was . There was a calendar on the wall to the left of the counter , and Hannah noticed the date . Norman had taken this photograph when Ross Barton and his movie crew were in Lake Eden . The clock on the wall told her that it was almost noon , the time when Ross and his crew arrived to have lunch at The Cookie Jar . Hannah guessed she could have been thinking about Ross , her old college friend who \'d turned out to be much more than that . Then there was Mike Kingston . She could have been thinking of Lake Eden \'s most eligible bachelor , the best-looking detective in the Winnetka County Sheriff \'s           her face and made her heart race harder in her chest . Or perhaps she \'d been thinking of Norman . While he was n\'t heart-stopping handsome , he was kind , and sweet , and sexy , and gentle , and ... " Good heavens ! " Hannah exclaimed under her breath . Since she did n\'t remember why she \'d been smiling , her smile would just have to remain a mystery . She gave one last look and turned to head for the Creative Arts Building , reminding herself that no one knew why the Mona Lisa had been smiling , either . Hannah took a shortcut through the food court , an area with picnic tables that was ringed by food and snack stands . Some of them were getting ready to open , and Hannah stopped in front of a sign that read , DEEP-FRIED CANDY BARS . One glance at the description that was written in smaller type near the bottom of the sign and Hannah \'s mouth started to water . The candy bars were impaled on sticks , chilled thoroughly , dipped           one used for funnel cakes , and then deep-fried to a golden brown . The booth was called Sinful Pleasures , and that was entirely appropriate . There should have been a warning sign that read , NO REDEEMING NUTRITIONAL MERIT WHATSOEVER , but Hannah doubted that would stop anyone from ordering . The choices of candy bar were varied , and she was in the process of debating the virtues of a Milky Way over a Snickers Bar when she heard a voice calling her name . Hannah turned to see her sister Andrea running toward her across the food court . Her face was pink from exertion , and wisps of blond hair had escaped the elaborate twist she \'d pinned up on the top of her head . She was wearing a perfectly ordinary outfit , light blue slacks with a matching sleeveless blouse , but she still looked like a fashion model . " Amazing , " Hannah muttered under her breath . " Totally amazing . " " What \'s amazing ? " Andrea asked , arriving at her side . " You look gorgeous           my oldest clothes and my hair \'s a mess . " " It does n\'t matter . You still look gorgeous . " " It \'s nice of you to say that , but I do n\'t have time to talk about that now . I tracked you down because I need your help and I \'m in a real rush . " Andrea stopped and stared as someone opened the shutters on the fried candy bar booth from the inside . " I read about those deep-fried candy bars in the Lake Eden Journal . You \'re not going to order one , are you ? " " They \'re not really open yet , " Hannah hedged . " None of the food booths open until noon . " " Well , that \'s a relief ! " Andrea fanned her face with her hand . " I do n\'t have to tell you that they \'re loaded with calories , and you still have n\'t lost the weight you put on over Christmas , do I ? " " Absolutely not , " Hannah said . Wild           she was sorely tempted to come back when the fair officially opened and order one . " Why do you need my help ? " " Let \'s sit down and I \'ll show you . " Andrea led the way to one of the picnic tables that sat in the shade of a huge elm . She brushed off the top and opened the file folder she was carrying . " Photos for the Mother-Daughter contest ? " Hannah stated the obvious as Andrea laid out four different poses of her and Hannah \'s oldest niece , Tracey . " That \'s right . Norman dropped them off last night and I ca n\'t decide which one is the best . I have to turn it in at ten this morning , " Andrea frowned as she glanced at her watch , " and I \'ve got only twelve minutes to take it to the secretary \'s office . " Hannah looked at each photograph in turn . They were all good , but one was a smidgeon better . " This one , " she said , pointing           Because your heads are tilted at exactly the same angle . " " That \'s true , " Andrea said , but she did n\'t look happy . " How about the one on the end ? " " It \'s a good picture , but the resemblance is n\'t as striking . Tracey \'s looking straight at the camera , and you \'re looking off to the side . " " I know . I noticed that . It \'s just ... " Andrea \'s voice trailed off , and she gave a little sigh . " It \'s just what ? " " My hair looks better in the picture on the end . " " True , but it \'s not a beauty pageant . It \'s a mother-daughter look-alike contest . " " You \'re right , of course . " Andrea gathered up the photos and put them back in the folder . " I \'ll use the one you picked . " Hannah \'s sisterly radar went on full alert . Something was wrong . Andrea was worried about how she looked , and           minutes . " What \'s wrong with your hair ? " she asked , forgetting to even try to phrase the question tactfully . " I knew it ! " Andrea wailed , and her eyes filled with tears . " You noticed and that means everyone in town will notice . Bill said he could n\'t see any more , but he must have missed one . " " One what ? " Andrea took a deep breath for courage and then she blurted it out . " A gray hair ! I \'m going gray , Hannah , and I \'m only twenty-six . It \'s just awful , especially since Mother is n\'t even gray yet ! " She would be without the wonders of modern cosmetology , Hannah thought , but she did n\'t say it . She \'d promised Delores she \'d never tell that an expensive hair color called Raven Wing was partially responsible for her mother \'s youthful appearance . Wishing for the wisdom of the Sphinx , or at least that of a clinical psychiatrist , Hannah waded in with both feet           if it took a little white lie to accomplish it . " Oatmeal , " she said , remembering the extra bag of cookies she was carrying in her large shoulder bag . " What ? " " Mother swears oatmeal prevents aging . She eats it every day . " " I know it \'s supposed to be good for your cholesterol , and some people use it for facials . " Andrea looked thoughtful . " Does Mother really believe that it keeps her from going gray ? " " Absolutely . But whatever you do , you ca n\'t mention it to her . " " Why not ? " " Because we \'re not supposed to believe she \'s old enough to have gray hair . If we mention it , she \'ll take it as an insult . " Andrea thought about that for a moment . " You \'re right . I \'ll never mention it . " " So are you going to try it ? " Andrea made a face . " I hate oatmeal . Remember how you used to try           sugar and making a face out of chocolate chips on the top ? " " I remember . And it worked because you always cleaned your bowl . " " You only thought it worked . I ate off the brown sugar and the chocolate chips , and then I gave the bowl to Bruno when you were n\'t looking . " " You did ? " Hannah was disillusioned . She thought she \'d been so clever in getting her sister to eat oatmeal , and the Swensen family dog had gotten it instead . " Maybe I should n\'t have told you , " Andrea said , watching the play of emotions that crossed Hannah \'s face . ( \n p100 he \'s still an adult . The pedophile , when he \'s with kids , he becomes a kid . It \'s not like a forty-two-year-old guy and a bunch of ten-year-olds ; it \'s more like just a bunch of ten-yearolds and one of them is a lot bigger and older-looking . There \'s a peer quality in the interaction . " See , I think I told you that a lot of these guys get fixated at some age , probably when they were abused , and they do n\'t really grow beyond that . Their bodies do , of course , and they learn how they \'re supposed to act so they can look like adults , but inside they \'re still a kid . At an emotional level , they \'re still eight or ten or whatever . " I \'d guess that Reiter \'s fixated around nine or ten , right before puberty , so when he \'s with these nine-year-olds , he really understands them in ways that a normal adult just does n\'t . One place you see it is the jokes . Nine-year-old jokes are generally dumb to an adult           scream . He can even tell nine-year-old jokes . The kids love it . " " And the Vietnamese kids ? " " Victims , too . We \'re seeing a lot of victimization of Asian immigrants in San Francisco . They \'re perfect prey for these guys . The guy befriends the family ; he \'s their friend , their protector , then when he hits on the kid , the kid ca n\'t say no . He ca n\'t tell his family , and if he refuses , he \'s scared that the family will suffer . So he goes along . " " It \'s so ugly , " I said . Marley nodded . The story was much the same at the other two clubs -- testimonials to Judge Reiter \'s warmth and generosity of spirit , accolades for his contributions to the community , and at each , a single boy who was particularly close to him . I dropped Marley at the BART station so he could get back to San Francisco , and had a quick dinner in Oakland before my appointment with           house was in Piedmont , a wealthy enclave completely surrounded by Oakland . I \'ve always wondered how Piedmont \'s city fathers got away with carving out a little island of wealth and privilege for themselves and incorporating it as a separate city . They \'d managed to create a WASP \'s dream , a community where the range of income ran from very rich to well-to-do . Poor people here were the ones with only two garages . Steve Marley and I had driven by Reiter \'s house earlier in the day when we came to interview the director at the recreation center about the computer club . Even in the daytime we \'d needed a street map to find it . It was on Glen Ellen Drive , a street that looked like it belonged in Beverly Hills . The house was an American version of an English manor house , Tudor style with exposed beams and mullioned windows with tiny panes . This was n\'t a large house ; it was a small mansion . It could easily have sat on a hill overlooking acres of open           an immaculately tended yard with a grumpy French chateau looming over its color-coordinated gardens . The lawn looked as if it had been brushed instead of mowed , and trees that were thoughtless enough to drop leaves were probably pulled out and cut into neatly stacked cords of firewood . This was not a neighborhood where you did surveillance . Any stranger who stopped for more than twenty-five seconds was probably reported to the police department . I wondered how Mitch had gone about his investigation of Reiter . It was n\'t any easier to find Reiter \'s place in the dark . I was glad I knew which house it was . Rich people do n\'t put up house numbers . The door was opened by a tall , olive-skinned young man in a suit . I was n\'t sure if he was a butler or a friend . The entrance hall was paneled in dark wood and was larger than my entire living room . You could have played basketball in the living room except that it was stuffed full of furniture . The drapes p102 and couches           seemed to be subtly at war with one another . And the exquisite Oriental carpet was n\'t speaking to either of them . My mother would have been shocked that anyone would put three patterns together and expect them to get along , but the room had obviously been done by a designer , and they play by a different set of rules . The assortment of people in the room got along about as well as the prints . There were five women and three men ; most were in their late forties , early fifties . Two of the women were fashionably close to anorexia , one had clearly stepped over the line , and two had given up the battle and were comfortably overweight . All five wore sweaters and slacks with accessories worth more than most of my better dresses . The men rose when I entered the room , and the tallest of the three came to greet me . I recognized him from the newspaper photographs , though he was a bit heavier than I \'d expected . He was a little shorter than           not really heavy but with the soft paunch that men develop when they forsake exercise but not wine . From Joe and the resume I knew that Reiter must be in his late fifties , but neither his face nor his body gave him away . His hair had receded and thinned , but it was a sandy color that does n\'t show the gray , and he moved with the ease and vitality of a younger man . " Ms. Sayler , we \'re delighted you could join us , he said , then went on to introduce the others and put in a plug for the arts commission \'s Mayfest . The Mayfest was to be a community-wide art festival on the first weekend in May . I heard more about it than I wanted to know , but I took notes faithfully and even asked a couple of questions . At one point in college I \'d thought I wanted to be an investigative reporter and had joined the school newspaper . Several weeks of covering meetings like this had convinced me that I \'d never get           hours , and my presence probably kept everyone on task and better behaved than they \'d have managed by themselves . Four of the women were involved in Junior League and made frequent references to a conflict in that organization , which they found considerably more interesting than the Mayfest . The most stimulating discussion of the evening involved the boundary between art and craft and the importance of keeping people who crocheted pot holders from exhibiting their wares . The big surprise of the evening was the arrival home of Judge Reiter \'s wife , Aileen . This was clearly not the wife Joe had mentioned . This was the trophy wife -- the gorgeous younger woman , the payoff for wealth and power . She was in her late twenties or early thirties with selfassurance and poise beyond her years , the product of a good Eastern college , most likely . Her conservatively tailored suit and briefcase suggested that she was an executive-model trophy wife . Aileen did n\'t stick around for the interview . Reiter offered me brandy , a real step-up from the coffee he           to have an intimate chat in a room the size of a small stadium , but Reiter managed to establish a feeling of intimacy through the intensity of his attention . The man was a master of sincere eye contact . We covered his civic and artistic activities . The list matched the one on his vita . " I notice that a number of your volunteer activities involve work with boys . Can you tell me about the special appeal of that kind of work ? " I actually said that with not a hint of irony in my voice , and I kept a straight face . I learned it by watching the White House press corps . " I think my work with boys is the most important thing I do , " he said , giving me a smile , that had helped make some orthodontist rich . " There are so many boys who do n\'t have fathers at home anymore . They \'re desperate for male role models , and there are less of those available all the time . When I p104 was           did n\'t get on with your father , you had uncles or older cousins . You could go down to the playground and find a director who \'d teach you to play basketball . There were sports , boys \' clubs , Scouts , lots of places boys got together . " Today , the uncles live across town or in another state . The playgrounds do n\'t have money to do more than cut the grass . The schools ca n\'t afford extracurricular activities , and too many adults are too busy to coach soccer or lead Scouts . " They do n\'t know what they \'re missing . Believe me , I get far more from the boys I work with than I give . " It was all I could do not to choke at that one , but I must have done a good job of concealing my emotions , because he continued . " I used to coach soccer , but an old knee injury acted up , so now I \'m confined to chess and computer , things like that . " It \'s           \'s part of the joy of being a parent . I missed out on that , but I tell you , I feel like I \'ve had dozens of sons . Boys I coached ten , fifteen years ago still come back to see me when they \'re in town . It \'s a great feeling . " Watching his enthusiasm and listening to the obvious pride and affection in his voice , it was hard to hold on to the other reality . I had no doubt that Joe was telling the truth , but I also had no doubt that Reiter believed that he , too , was telling the truth . " I know your professional activities as a judge must keep you very busy , " I said . " How do you find the time for all your volunteer activities ? " " I do n\'t play golf or tennis , " he said with a laugh . " No , seriously , I do n\'t know how much you know about my life , but I lost my first wife in an accident ,           remarried . My activities in the community are what got me through that difficult period . I spend much of my professional life dealing with the darker side of human nature . I find the laughter of children a powerful antidote to the p105 grimness of that reality and to any personal depression that I might be tempted to indulge in . " I had plenty to think about on the drive home . I had n\'t expected Reiter to be a monster , but I was certainly not prepared to find him so likable . My investigation would save some boys from exploitation , but it would cost many more a friend and confidant . p106 I arrived home to find Peter holed up in the bedroom , reading John McPhee , and Molly studying As You Like It to rock accompaniment . Stone had curled up on a sweatshirt she \'d dropped on the floor , and was kneading and purring enthusiastically . His face was set in an expression of glassy-eyed ecstasy that bordered on the lewd . " Steve Marley called , " Molly informed me           was n\'t good news . Marley \'s mother had fallen and was in the hospital . He \'d gone to Ukiah and did n\'t know how long he \'d be there . A better person would have worried about Marley \'s mother , instead of feeling irritated about losing him at a crucial point in the investigation . I was not that better person . The alarm woke me from an unpleasant dream in which I wandered through a trackless forest , trying to find a path out . I had p107 the sense of something ominous following me , but never figured out what it was . It was a dream I was glad to leave unfinished . At the office , over a second cup of industrial-strength coffee , I reviewed my options . The prudent thing to do was to wait for Marley \'s return . If we \'d been dealing with an embezzler or even a spy , I \'d have done that , but there was too much at stake to sit back and wait . I could n\'t know what a day or two           I was n\'t willing to gamble on it . The obvious starting point was the boys themselves . I had three names -- Jon Marcus and Ben Sutter in Oakland , and Mark Lashman in Piedmont . I was fairly sure that all three were being molested by Reiter , and equally sure that none would want to admit it . I \'d have to talk with their parents and convince them to let someone question the boys . I could think of several hundred things I \'d rather do than tell a mother that her son was the victim of a pedophile , but none of those things was going to put a stop to Reiter \'s activities , so I poured a third cup of coffee and called Jon Marcus \'s mother , Sally . She could see me anytime during the day . I suggested later that morning . Irene Lashman , Mark \'s mother , was terribly busy but finally agreed that she could work me in around one today . Rosemary Sutter worked until five but agreed to let me come at six . I           find that he \'d be at soccer practice . My desk calendar had the name Glosser written across it in red . The week I \'d promised Jesse that I \'d wait was up . I was too busy to do much about it today , but I could get Chris started on a background search . I called her in and told her what I needed . " So you \'re going to do it , " she said grimly . Chris is the straight arrow in the office . I could tell that she did n\'t approve . p108 " Yes , " I said , thinking it was good she worked for me instead of vice versa . I do n\'t think I \'d have lasted long in Chris \'s agency . The first boy , Jon Marcus , lived with his mother and two younger sisters in east Oakland . The neighborhood had never been a particularly affluent one , but the small , sturdy houses had been the pride of working-class families on the way up . By the eighties the working class was shrinking           and those who could afford to were fleeing the urban jungle for safer havens . The people left on Sally Marcus \'s street were the ones who could n\'t get out . Iron bars on doors and windows announced that the occupants were under siege . Some yards still showed the effects of loving care , but most were knee high in weeds . The Marcus \'s house was somewhere in the middle . Someone had made an attempt to keep the lawn alive and mowed , but the house needed a paint job and the windows were so grimy that seeing much through them would be a real challenge . There was n\'t much to see , anyway . The iron-barred gate that protected the front door made some attempt to appear ornamental . It did n\'t succeed . I rang the bell , and a dog barked and hurled itself against the door . After a few minutes , the door opened a crack , and a woman peered out at me . The dog -- a tan , fifty-seven-variety mutt -- struggled to thrust its head out           " Mrs. Marcus ? " I asked . She nodded . " I \'m Catherine Sayler . I called about the chess club . " She opened the door wider , grabbed the dog by the collar and unlocked the iron gate . She looked about forty-five , but she was probably much younger . Her limp brown hair was straight ; whoever \'d cut it had n\'t worried much about style . Her pale skin had a sallow cast . She looked tired . p109 The living room had been furnished from Goodwill . Nothing matched , and none of the furniture looked like anything anyone would choose . I sat down on a hideous brownish-yellow tweed sofa and immediately jumped up when something sharp dug into my thigh . Mrs. Marcus stepped forward and pulled a battered toy gun from between the couch cushions . " I \'m sorry , " she said wearily . " I keep telling \' em to clean up their things , but they never listen . " When we \'d gotten settled and I \'d established that the children were out of           I understand your son is quite active in the chess club at Saint Stephen \'s . " " Yes , he \'s real good at it , too . He can beat lots of grown-ups . " " Does he spend much time on club activities ? " " Oh yes . He \'s gone one or two evenings a week and often on the weekends , too . It \'s a godsend for a kid like Jon , keeps him out of trouble . In a neighborhood like this , there \'s always plenty of that . " I felt my throat and chest tighten . I \'d found exactly what I was looking for , but there was more grief than elation in it . I did not want to tell this woman that the chess club met only for an hour after school once a week and that actual tournaments occurred only a few times a year . And I did n\'t want to tell her about what was really happening on all those evenings and weekends that Jon was supposed to be at the chess club           face became even paler . When I finished , she said , " I do n\'t believe it . Jon would n\'t ... " " It \'s very hard for a child to resist in a situation like this . We teach them to trust and obey adults . This man has probably spent months winning Jon \'s trust and affection . If it happened , Jon was probably too confused to resist , and afterward he felt too guilty to say anything . " " But , the school sponsors this club . " p110 " The school has no idea what \'s going on . The man who advises the club , the molester , is a respected member of the community . He \'s been doing this for many years , and he \'s been very successful at hiding it . " " No , " she said , getting up and beginning to pace . " It just is n\'t possible . " " Has Jon brought home any expensive gifts , things he would n\'t have money to buy himself ? " " No .           looked around the room and into the dining room that adjoined it . On a desk in the corner sat a portable computer . " What about the computer ? Where did he get that ? " " He won it . It was a prize in one of his tournaments . I told you he was good . " Her tone was defensive . She knew , but she could n\'t admit it , even to herself . " That \'s an awfully expensive prize . Have there been others ? " The look on her face told me that there had . She was very close to tears , but she was holding them back . " No , it could n\'t be , " she said fiercely . " Jon needs help with this , " I said . " He probably wo n\'t admit what \'s going on at first , but it \'s confusing and upsetting to a child . When someone you trust demands sex in return for their affection and friendship , it \'s shattering . And every time it happens , every           . If it continues , it can destroy his ability to trust other people or himself . " " No , no , " she kept repeating . " It \'s not happening . " There was a fierceness to her face that was unnerving . " I can recommend a counselor to work with Jon . " " No , " she said . " No . You do n\'t have any proof . You \'re just guessing . " " I do n\'t know for sure , only Jon can tell us that . But we know the man he \'s been with is accused of doing this before . We know that he \'s been telling you he \'s going to chess club when he is n\'t , and we know he \'s been getting expensive gifts . p111 Will you agree to having him see a counselor ? Will you let the counselor work with him , try to find out what \'s been happening ? It \'s the only way to help Jon out of this . " She sank into a chair . "           " You do n\'t know what it \'s like , you ca n\'t , trying to raise three kids on next to nothing and nobody helping and nobody even gives a damn . They sell crack up the street , just three houses from here , and there was a drive-by shooting just a couple of blocks away . " Jon \'s dad left when I was pregnant with his sister , the little one . Did n\'t even stick around to find out if it was a girl or a boy . Just left and never looked back . I try , God knows I do , but he \'s almost as tall as I am already , Jon is , and he \'s always talking back and acting up . He \'s only ten . What \'s it going to be like when he \'s fifteen ? " She buried her head in her hands , but still she did n\'t cry . She seemed totally exhausted . " I just ca n\'t handle it , " she said . " I ca n\'t take any more .           both of you . Part of Jon \'s poor behavior is probably caused by the abuse . Kids who are sexually abused frequently become angry and take it out on people around them , " I said . " With therapy we can turn that around . " She just kept shaking her head . I told her that the counselor would n\'t charge her to question Jon about the abuse , that the county would provide ongoing counseling for him . I do n\'t know if she even heard me . She seemed to withdraw into her own misery . Finally , she said , " Well , I just wo n\'t let him go to chess club anymore . " " That \'s a start , but it wo n\'t deal with the damage that \'s already been done . He needs help with this now . If he does n\'t get that , he \'ll continue to have behavior problems . The problems will get worse . " " No , we \'ll be okay , " she said . " He wo n\'t go to chess           let the counselor see him ? " p112 " No . No , it \'s over . " " Please , Mrs. Marcus . It \'s not over for Jon , and it ca n\'t really be over until he \'s faced it and worked through all the feelings and confusion it \'s created . " " I do n\'t hold with all the psychology stuff , and we do n\'t go telling our family problems to strangers , " she said stiffly . " Jon is the victim of a crime , a serious crime . You can help the police put the criminal away . You and Jon can stop him from doing this to any other child . " " Crime ? Tell me about crime . They \'re killing people on the streets and the police do n\'t do nothing about it . Leave me alone , lady . I \'ve already got more problems than I can handle . I do n\'t need more . " A bitterness had crept into her tone and a stubbornness . I was n\'t going to get any further           and told her to call if she changed her mind . p113 Piedmont appears particularly lush when you come from the obvious poverty of east Oakland . It \'s enough to make a liberal weep and a radical start building bombs . It did n\'t do a lot for my already sinking spirits . The Lashmans \' house was fairly modest in comparison to the mansions and Architectural Digest candidates that make up much of Piedmont . In any other neighborhood , it would have been a nice middle-class house , but its address bumped it up to lowerupper or upper-middle or whatever they call the wannabe rich . The woman who answered the door was tall , blond , and fashionably thin . She was wearing jeans and a Western-style shirt , but the look was anything but casual , more on the order of Vogue does the Old West . " Mrs. Lashman ? " " Yes ? " The voice had a sharpness to it . She probably thought I was selling magazine subscriptions . " I \'m Catherine Sayler . I called about the computer club           please . " Her tone thawed a few degrees . She led me to a living room furnished with metal , glass , and p114 leather , and offered me a chair that looked like it had been designed by the Marquis de Sade . I took a bit longer getting to the point this time . Irene Lashman seemed made of tougher stuff than Sally Marcus , but I wanted to avoid the reaction my revelations had produced the last time . Where Sally \'s face had broadcast her every reaction , Irene \'s was a mask . No emotion was allowed to reach the surface , but the muscles around her mouth tightened as I spoke . Between her silence and lack of expression , she gave me as much feedback as a statue , making it impossible to guess the impact my words were having on her . She remained that way until I finished . Then she said very coolly , " Those are very serious allegations . " " Yes , they are . The impact of this sort of abuse is very serious .           help -- a lot of support from you and professional counseling . " Before I could go on , she stopped me . " I do n\'t know who you are or why you \'re doing this , but Judge Reiter is a good friend of this family , and I wo n\'t hear any more attacks on his character . I think you \'d better go . " She rose to see me out , but I remained seated . " I know it \'s difficult to even contemplate the possibility . No parent wants to think that something like this could happen to their child , but if you do n\'t at least consider it , you risk leaving Mark in a terrible situation . " " I asked you to leave , " she said . " If you do n\'t , I \'ll call the police . " " Then you \'re not even going to ask Mark ? " " Of course not . " " Let me at least tell you what kind of signs you might look for to tell you that he           head . " I do n\'t need to know . This is a fine Christian family and my son is a fine young man . Your suggestions are a profound insult . " " A victim is not responsible for what \'s done to him , " I p115 said . " This is not Mark \'s fault , and it \'s no reflection on his character . " " I will not have you try to involve my family in this sort of filth . And I wo n\'t have you interfere with his relationship with Judge Reiter . If you so much as mention my son \'s name to anyone , you will hear from my lawyer . " I struggled to keep anger from my voice . " This is not a matter of social standing . This is your son \'s life . I can understand that you do n\'t want to believe that Mark is a victim . That \'s a normal reaction . But I ca n\'t understand how you can leave him in jeopardy . . . " I wanted to add "           before your child \'s wel-fare , " but I did n\'t . Instead , I got up and went to the front door . There I stopped and took out my card . " If you change your mind and want help with this , please call me . I can put you in touch with a juvenile officer who specializes in helping boys like Mark . " She did n\'t take the card , so I put it on the hall table and left . I was shaking with rage by the time I got into my car , but I did n\'t want to sit in front of the La\'shman house while I waited for it to pass . I drove very slowly around the corner and pulled into the curb . I knew with a sickening certainty that both boys were victims . Jon would turn to a man who offered stability and safety . The gifts , things he could never afford to have , would sweeten the appeal , but it would be the sense of being cared for by a strong , protecting adult           guess what Reiter would offer Mark to win his trust and devotion . Raised in a home where appearance and social position were all-important , the boy would be an easy mark for a powerful man who seemed to like him just for himself . p116 I could understand Sally Marcus . She had used herself up in the daily struggle of life , and she no longer possessed the strength to protect her son . But Irene Lashman was another matter . Her need to maintain an acceptable facade , a respectable social position , was more important to her than her son \'s welfare . She seemed to me almost as bad as Reiter . I had over four hours before my appointment with Rosemary Sutter . It took that long to calm down . I took a long walk around Reiter \'s neighborhood . The houses were spectacular , yards designed and maintained by professionals -- all the beauty money can buy . Another time I might have enjoyed it , but after my visit to Irene Lashman , it depressed me . All this wealth and           . I thought of Molly . What did she need ? And could I give it to her ? She bounced between pleasant , easygoing sociability and sullen hostility . I was n\'t handling the hostility well . I was awkward in my new role of surrogate parent , and in my frustration , I came down on Molly harder than I intended and created more problems than I solved . Being a parent was such a big responsibility and the costs were so appalling if you failed . It was easy to pity Sally Marcus and feel contempt for Irene Lashman , but I \'d been fitting Molly in around the other demands in my life . She was far more important to me than this case could ever be , yet tonight I \'d be late getting home and the time I \'d been planning to have with her would get put off again . It was a short drive down the hill to Grand Avenue in Oakland . Grand runs right up to the end of Lake Merritt , an urban jewel in a setting that is           has a nice small-town feel to it . Many of the buildings date from the forties , and while most p117 are well maintained , few have been indulged with fancy face-lifts . The Sutters \' apartment was in a building a block from Grand Avenue in a neighborhood no longer grand but still comfortable . I rang and identified myself . A muffled female voice told me to come on up to 312 on the third floor . The buzzer let out a sound like a dental drill from hell , and I pushed the iron gate open and followed the directions to 312 . Rosemary Sutter was a small woman , barely over five feet . Her curly black hair was cut short and her large brown eyes reflected the smile on her lips . " Do come in , " she said warmly . She offered me a chair and perched on the edge of the sofa , watching me expectantly . " What \'s this about the chess club ? " she asked . The story got harder with each telling , and the stakes got           parents to have their son see Steve Marley , I \'d have to start all over again on the search for victims , and the further back in time I had to go , the colder the trail would become . Without a victim willing to speak up , there \'d be no way to stop the judge from seducing and destroying the boys who came to trust him . There \'d be no way to get help for Jon and Mark and Ben , no satisfaction for Joe , no justice for Mitch . I tried a different approach . " Have you noticed any changes in your son \'s behavior since he joined the chess club ? " I asked . The question surprised her , but she considered it . " He joined about a year ago . I do n\'t recall any changes then . " Something in her tone told me to push on . " How about since then ? " She fidgeted and looked uncomfortable . " Why do you ask ? " " Because I think that something may have happened at           have caused a change in his behavior . " " What ? " she asked sharply . p120 I could see her relief at having something concrete to do . " Just tell me where and when to bring him , " she said . " I \'ll be honest with you , " I said . " This is n\'t going to be easy on Ben . He \'s apt to resist it . It may take some time . " " I understand . " " He \'ll want to avoid it . There \'ll be a tremendous desire to ignore it and hope it \'ll go away . " " You ca n\'t do that , " she said grimly . " It does n\'t work . " I wondered what experience had taught her that , but she was n\'t about to tell me , and I was n\'t anxious to know . I \'d seen enough human misery already today . I gave her my phone number and told her that I \'d ask Steve Marley to call her . I was so tired that           Three interviews , maybe two hours \' total , but so much pain . I found a cafe on Grand Avenue where I could get something to eat . I hoped that food would give me some energy , but I knew that my exhaustion had little to do with nutrition . I wondered how many boys Samuel Reiter had abused during his lifetime . How many lives had he torn apart ? How many boys had learned too young that you ca n\'t trust anyone ? p121 When you \'re in hurry , it \'s easy to make mistakes . But when you \'re in a hurry , you tend to forget that . I \'d been in such a hurry to get the Reiter case wrapped up that I had n\'t wanted to wait for Steve Marley \'s return . When he called that night , he did n\'t hide his displeasure at my activities . " You went to see the parents ? I never talk to parents . You should have gone to the Oakland police and let them handle it . " I did n\'t           I said , " and besides , I got what I was after . Rosemary Sutter is willing to have you interview Ben . How soon do you think you can do it ? " Marley had already told me that his mother \'s fall had produced no more serious injuries than a number of ugly bruises . She was not the kind of woman to hang around the hospital , and had gone home and resumed spading the garden as soon as she could bully the doctor into releasing her . Marley could stick around and paint her kitchen or go home and paint his own . I figured I could make him a better offer . p122 " I could drive back tonight , " he said . " If you can set it up for tomorrow , I \'ll see him then . If not , we could do it Monday . " " I \'ll try for tomorrow , " I said . Rosemary was as anxious as I was to get moving . She offered to bring Ben to my office the next morning .           few polite questions to get Ben to admit what was going on with Samuel Reiter . " Think of the worst secret you know , the most embarrassing thing you could admit about yourself , and imagine what it would take to get you to tell that to a stranger , " I said . It would take getting through every defense that Ben had erected , building enough trust so he could risk telling the truth , wearing down his resistance until it was easier to talk than to keep covering up , and finally , convincing him that his private pain was not his alone . That was the distance Marley had to cross to reach Ben , and it was full of emotional mines . Marley would begin by establishing rapport and building trust . He \'d ask easy questions to get a sense of how Ben reacted when he was telling the truth , then he \'d move to the harder ones and watch for the subtle signs that the boy was lying or trying to hide something . His questions would tell Ben that he           the same story from other boys . Slowly , in the hours they spent together , Steve would create the safe space in which Ben could finally open up . Rosemary brought Ben to my office the next morning . She had n\'t confronted him about Reiter , and he was happy enough to miss a day of school that he did n\'t ask too many questions about where they were going . Steve took over my office . McGee had already settled in on p123 the couch and saw no reason to leave , and Ben immediately took to the lazy torn and began stroking him . McGee is a shameless hustler . He rolled right over on his back and began purring like mad . I figured Ben could use all the support he could get . For once McGee was actually earning his keep . I finally convinced Rosemary that there was n\'t any need to hover outside the door . She could n\'t think of anywhere to go , so I suggested a museum . " Go to the De Young . You can walk around           . Call every hour or so , and I \'ll tell you how it \'s going . " She went , but only because she could n\'t think of a good excuse for staying . It was a long day for all of us , probably longest for Ben . Steve Marley came out after about thirty minutes . " He \'s a victim , I \'d bet on it . But I do n\'t know how long it \'ll take to get him to admit it , " he said . I played waitress , taking in cider and doughnuts , sandwiches , and other munchies . Each time Ben looked tighter and more drawn . Rosemary called every half hour . My heart went out to both of them . Since Jesse was still in Sunnyvale , I \'d taken over his office just down the hall from mine . I still had plenty of work to catch up on , but I did n\'t get much done , and I \'d guess that Amy \'s productivity was also near zero . Around eleven o\'clock I got a           this is Lawrence Chilton of Pacific Rim . " Pacific Rim imports mechanized toys and other low-tech goodies from the Far East . Lawrence Chilton is its founder and president . He \'d hired me last year to find out how crates that contained highly sophisticated toy robots when they left Japan arrived in San Francisco full of cheap copies from Indonesia . " Yes , Mr. Chilton . What can I do for you ? " " I \'m calling because I understand that you \'ve made some very serious allegations against a good friend of mine , Samuel Reiter . I \'m sure there must be some mistake here . " p124 It sure had n\'t taken long for word to get back to Reiter , and it had n\'t taken him long to counterattack . I could see the Old Boys circling up to protect their own . I wanted to ask Chilton if he had children and how he \'d feel about a man who befriended them and then demanded sex . Instead , I said in as neutral a tone as I could manage ,           , but I \'m sure you understand that I ca n\'t discuss a case with anyone other than my client . I owe him the same confidentiality that I promised you . " " Yes , of course , " he said . The irritation in his voice said , " Who the hell are you to defy me ? " " I \'m glad you understand , " I said before he could tack on a " but . " " Let me assure you that I will conduct this investigation with the same integrity and discretion that I provided Pacific Rim . " " This does n\'t seem an appropriate kind of case for your agency , " Chilton said . " I doubt that I \'d have selected you as our investigator if I \'d known you were also involved in this sort of thing . " " That would certainly have been your right , just as it \'s my right to decide which cases I choose to take . " I got two more calls before lunch . I gave them both the confidentiality speech           it any better than he did . One , a bank vice-president , took the avuncular approach and warned me to beware of tales scoundrels tell . The other came very close to warning me that I \'d never work in this town again . My dad used to say that when you pull on a snake \'s tail you \'d better watch out for the other end . This snake was proving to have sharp fangs and a long reach . I was surprised by Reiter \'s reaction . I \'d known when I left Irene Lashman that there was a real danger she \'d call him , but I \'d assumed that he \'d want to keep my investigation a secret p125 and hope that none of the boys would talk . Instead , he \'d taken the offensive , recruiting his powerful friends to warn me off . It was an aggressive move . It made me wonder about how he would have responded to Mitch . The threats of influential businessmen would n\'t have been of any use there . Would he have ordered up a           called his friends about me ? And if so , would he try the same solution on me when he found out that threats had n\'t worked ? A little after three , I was startled by a loud shout from my office . Ben was screaming at Steve . The words were muffled by the door but the fury behind them came through . The angry shouting was followed by sobbing , as loud as the shouts at first and slowly quieting down . After what seemed forever , Steve came out . He looked emotionally and physically exhausted . " Ask his mother to come back when she calls , " he said . " Ben could probably use something to drink . " I took Ben a Coke and some chocolate chip cookies . His face was streaked with tears , and he looked terribly young and vulnerable . He was clutching McGee on his lap and stroking him absentmindedly , a liberty that the big tom had never allowed an adult . Steve was planning to wait until Monday to talk to the Oakland police ,           Reiter \'s friends he changed his mind . " Damn , I was afraid of that . It means we have to move fast , " he said . " There \'s a good chance he \'s already gotten rid of any evidence in his house . We have to hope he does n\'t realize that we \'re ready to move . Guys like Reiter usually keep p126 mementos of their affairs -- photos , cards and letters from the boys , little presents -- stuff that helps us make the case and identify the other victims . We really want to get there before he disposes of that stuff . " " How fast can you move ? " Marley looked at his watch . " Friday afternoon . Boy , I do n\'t know . Especially when we \'re asking for a search warrant for the residence of a superior court judge . Let me make a couple of calls . " Marley got lucky ; an old friend in the Oakland PD agreed to wait for Rosemary and Ben to come down and file a report .           get the warrant written up , but we can get one of them at home to sign it . There \'ll be a lot of bitching about the screwed-up weekend , but we \'ll get it done . " Steve went with Rosemary and Ben . He put an arm around the youngster and spoke gently and encouragingly to him . " I \'m going to tell you exactly what to expect over there , " he said as they headed out my door . " You \'ve already been through the worst part . " I picked Marley up at the BART station at eight-fifteen . The sigh he heaved as he settled into the seat spoke of more than fatigue . " They \'re getting a warrant to search Reiter \'s house . They wanted to do more investigation and line up a couple of more kids before they asked for the warrant , but I convinced them that we could n\'t wait , not now that he knows we \'re after him . " Ben did great . He \'s bouncing between guilt and anger . One           the next he wants the cops to take Reiter out and shoot him . But he \'s holding it together . And the guys on the case are good . They believe Ben . They \'ll work hard to make a case . " We drove up Market Street . Homeless men and women were p127 settling into doorways and any other space that might offer a night \'s uneasy sleep . The temperatures in San Francisco in April might not be cold by comparison to much of the rest of the country , but they were a long way from anything you \'d want to sleep in , if you had any choice . " When will they search his house ? " I asked . " Tonight or tomorrow morning . I asked one of the guys to call me when they have the results . " " At least you \'ll get a week of fishing in , " I said , feeling guilty that I \'d used up half of his vacation . " I \'m ready for that . " I dropped him at his           the case would be over . I was ready to go back to some nice , quiet corporate crime . I was also ready to give up my daily round of AA meetings . I \'d sat through at least a dozen of them , telling my story and listening to others , and all I \'d gotten from it was more opportunity for self-scrutiny and reflection than I found comfortable . I do n\'t know that I was drinking less , but I sure was n\'t enjoying it the way I used to . That seemed like a heavy price to pay for the possibility that I might find someone who might know something about a man who might have been murdered . p128 Molly had been adamant about her desire to sleep in Saturday morning , and I agreed to let her miss aikido in exchange for her promise that she \'d do something with me in the afternoon . She was living in my house , but I \'d been busy enough with work that we had n\'t had nearly enough time together . It made me           should she not get what she needed from me . The aikido class went well . We had a couple of new women who were attending regularly and with growing enthusiasm . One was fifty and had gray hair and smile wrinkles , the other was fifteen . The fifty-year-old was feisty and exuberant , the fifteen-year-old , shy and retiring . They \'d adopted each other , and we all enjoyed watching their friendship develop . I wondered if the older woman ever felt awkward with her young friend the way I did so often with Molly . Molly was in the kitchen eating breakfast when I got home . She \'d made scrambled eggs , a welcome change from the junk food she ate in prodigious amounts . The counter was piled with p129 more dirty dishes than I would have dreamed you could use making such a simple dish . " Steve Marley called , " she said . " The number \'s next to the phone . " The number was n\'t next to the phone . It was over by the sink . Molly could           on the fifth ring . Background sounds suggested that the home improvement of the day involved some form of demolition . His voice was grim . " They \'ve done the search , and they got zip . He must have cleared out the house as soon as he heard that you were asking questions . " " Damn , " I said . " What does that do to the case ? " " Makes it harder , of course , but not impossible . We still have Ben \'s testimony , and the juvenile division will start tracing down every contact past and present . Sometimes you get a list of kids and acts and dates , and then it \'s real easy . This way is harder . " " Do you think he destroyed all the evidence ? " " I doubt it . Could you just burn up all your scrapbooks , old letters , and snapshots ? And I \'d bet Reiter is much more attached to his mementos than you are to yours . We \'re talking compulsion here . I \'d bet           the type of thing you box up and ask your neighbor to store . Where would he put it ? " " He could have an apartment somewhere , though Ben did n\'t mention one . Could have given it to another ped . Maybe he has a summer cabin . " " Or a boat , " I said , remembering Joe \'s snapshot . " Did Ben say anything about a boat ? " " No , but I can ask him . A man in Reiter \'s position might well have a summer place and a boat . I \'ll ask about both . " I made some fresh coffee and sat down at the table . " So what would you like to do this afternoon ? " p130 She shrugged . " You do n\'t have to entertain me , you know . " " I was n\'t planning to . But I was looking forward to spending a few hours with you . How about the Museum of Modern Art ? There \'s a new photography exhibit there . Or we could go walking           possibility seemed to enflame her with enthusiasm . I wondered what had happened to the cheerful little girl who was in love with the world a couple of years ago . The first horror writer to create body snatchers must have been the parent of a teenager . I made some more suggestions . She worked on perfecting her shrug . Finally , I said , " Let \'s hold up a bank . " She looked surprised . At least she was listening . " Just check-ing , " I said . " How about we change sides ? You make the suggestions and I \'ll shrug for a while . " " I know you \'re trying to help me , " she said , " but I \'m not into those things anymore . " " What are you into ? " " Hanging out with my friends . " " So why do n\'t we invite your friends to go along ? " " Catherine , " she said , in the tone I \'d used to say " Mother , " " my friends are           . " Having met the friends , I was n\'t sure I wanted to know what they were into . A dish crashed to the floor just behind me . It was followed by a large , very guilty-looking cat who made a dash for the door . " Stone , " I yelled , and threw a paper at him . " Bad cat . " Touchstone can move remarkably fast for a grossly overweight animal . He was under the bed by the time I \'d finished swearing at him . I do n\'t believe you can train a cat , that \'s part of why I like them so much . They have a bad attitude toward authority . With a cat , you learn to practice preventive behavior . With Touchstone , that means never leaving any form of food within his reach . It had taken two months to get Peter to accept that p131 dishes had to be rinsed before being abandoned on the counter . Now we had Molly . Molly who seemed to believe that dirty dishes magically cleaned themselves . When           and gone to heaven . Molly was working hard to suppress a giggle . She was saved by the phone . I answered it . A voice I did n\'t recognize said , " Molly ? " I gave her the phone and tried to decide whether I should leave the room . I settled for doing the dishes . " You can take it in my study if you want , " I said . " It \'s okay , " she said , and took the phone . Eavesdropping is an occupational hazard . I did n\'t mean to do it ; it \'s just an automatic reflex . " Uh , no , I ca n\'t , not today . I \'m supposed to do some stuff with my aunt . . . . Yeah , well , I \'ll try . . . . Yeah , I \'ll call you . " Not a lot of words , but the tone said , " Mental cruelty practiced here . " I was just finishing the dishes when the phone rang again . It was Marley with           at the Berkeley marina , and a cabin in Pinecrest . " I \'ll get the Oakland PD to get warrants for both of those , " he said . " Maybe we \'ll get lucky . " The morning had been cold and gray when I went to aikido , and it had progressed to a miserable thin mist . Just enough to make outdoor activity unpleasant , and not enough to help with the drought that had scorched the state for four years . We \'d had too many mornings like this . " Get your swimsuit , " I said . " What ? " " Get your suit , your bathrobe , and a couple of towels . And dress warm . " " Where are we going ? " she asked suspiciously . " You \'ll see . " p132 The town of Calistoga is about an hour north of San Francisco , in the middle of some of the most beautiful grape country in the world and right on top of a bunch of hot springs . Sam Brannan , who \'d dreamed of           Saratoga , had built quite a resort there in the 1850s , but the scheme had drained his wealth and a nasty divorce had taken the rest of his assets and left Calistoga a sleepy little town , until a few years ago when the yup people discovered it . Back East , sitting in hot water may be regarded as a cure for what ails you . Californians take a more hedonistic approach . Hot springs in the middle of a valley full of wineries is pretty close to our idea of heaven . The drive itself is worth the trip . The upper Napa Valley is covered with neatly tended rows of wine grapes , interrupted occasionally by ancient volcanic cones that rise like treecovered islands from a sea of vineyards . Thickly wooded hills frame the valley to the west and their arid , starkly rocky cousins form its boundary to the east . Downtown Calistoga is four blocks long and lined with buildings old enough to be picturesque . I turned at the second block and took us to the Roman Spa Motel . I love           in the health business . The pools are surrounded by palm trees and flowers , and at night steam rises from the outdoor pools in great dramatic clouds . Molly had n\'t said much on the way up . She was looking at me as though I \'d completely lost my mind . " Come on , " I Said . " At the worst you \'ll have a good story to tell your friends . " I bought day passes and we changed into our suits . The " cool " outdoor pool is somewhere around comfortable bath temperature . We started there , worked our way to the hotter indoor pool , and ended up in the small , very-hot pool under the palm trees . The lightest of rains brushed our faces , and even Molly could n\'t suppress a sigh of contentment. p133 I leaned back with the rain on my face and felt all the tension of the last couple of weeks drain away . When I \'d reached cooked-noodle status , I dragged myself out into the delicious coolness of the air . "           I asked . " I \'ve never had a massage . " " Always a first time . " We put on robes and headed to the long , low building in back . They \'d redone the office since my last visit , gone upscale , but the girl at the desk still looked like it was 1968 . " I can get you in , in about an hour , " she said . " Would you like a mud or an enzyme bath before the massage ? We \'re offering a special on them this weekend . " Immersing my body in hot mud , even healthy hot mud , has never particularly appealed to me , especially after a friend told me it felt like dying . That \'s an experience I do n\'t pay money to have . " What \'s the enzyme bath ? " I asked . " It \'s a Japanese practice , " she explained . " We put you in a tub with specially blended cedar fibers and plant enzymes . It \'s very warm and relaxing , stimulates the           , " Molly said . I was going to pass on the shredded cedar , but Molly looked interested , so I signed us up . Fifteen minutes later we were climbing into large boxes of what looked like sawdust . I grumbled . Molly said , " Relax , at worst you \'ll have a great story to tell Peter , or better yet , my mom . " The enzyme bath was a success before we ever got in it . It was relaxing and it smelled good . I do n\'t know what the enzymes did , but I had a short snooze and felt great when I climbed out . Getting all the little shreds of bark off my body would have been tedious as hell except that Molly developed a fit of the giggles , and we ended up clowning around and laughing like a couple of ten-year-olds . After the massage , we had an early dinner at a little restaurant p134 that reminded me that yuppification is not all bad . It does improve the quality of the food and wine . Molly           a kid , but she tried some duck sausages that were absolutely exotic for her . Sunset comes early in the valley , so much of our ride home was in fading light , but nothing could dampen our spirits . We were both a bit euphoric -- lots of " Look , there \'s a hawk on the fence " and " Jeeze , that \'s beautiful . " I wondered why she \'d locked that side of herself away for so long . In Marin , where houses had replaced the open country , she said , " You know , that really was fun . Mom never does anything for fun . " " Maybe her idea of fun is different , " I said . Marion \'s idea of fun had always been different from mine . " I guess , " Molly said . " You \'re different people . You like different things . " " Yeah , well , I just wish she \'d stop trying to make me into something I do n\'t want to be . She does n\'t know who           She wants me to be just like her . And when I \'m not , I \'m wrong . " I remember saying something similar to my mother . I also remember her sighing and telling me it was n\'t so easy being a parent . " She treats me like a baby , for chrissake , " Molly complained . " For all those years before Leonard came along , I was her big girl . \' I was mature enough to be home alone , to fix dinner for myself , to listen to her troubles . Now that I \'m really old enough to take care of myself , she \'s decided that I \'m still a child . \' " I remembered how Marion had praised Molly \'s independence and maturity when she was younger . Molly had had to be mature . There was n\'t much choice . Her daddy took a hike when she was six years old , and Marion was ill equipped to be on her own . There were times when Molly had seemed more responsible than her mother . She           Mommy \'s little girl " now that Marion was ready to take charge . " You \'re pretty grown-up , all right , " I said , " but it \'s a scary world out there . I would n\'t like to think of you having to face it all alone . " " I know kids who do . " " I know you do , " I said , " but it seems to me that no one cares enough about those kids to want to protect them . They have lots of freedom , but I do n\'t know that they have much else . " Molly was silent for a while . I did n\'t know whether she was thinking about what I \'d said or had dismissed me as a creature from the Dark Ages . I did know that teenagers do not say , " You \'re right . " p136 The red light on my answering machine blinked to tell me I had a call . Steve Marley \'s voice on the tape sounded excited . " Call me when you get in           . " I think we got a live one here , " he said . " The sailboat is n\'t at the Berkeley Marina . Reiter \'s slip is empty . He claims a friend is sailing the boat to Mexico , but I \'ve got a hunch it \'s closer than that . " " Are the police checking the local marinas ? " " I do n\'t know . It may take them a while to get around to it . " " I \'ll give them a little help , " I said . " Give me a description of the boat . " " It \'s a thirty-foot Catalina sloop , white . The name is the Jolly Roger , California registration number 360964 . " Tracing boats is n\'t my specialty , but I \'d done it once before as part of another case , so I had a starting point . My starting point was Larry Davis , the harbor master at Oyster Point . I called him first thing Monday morning . Larry remembered me . " You \'re the gorgeous creature who           , and destroyed my self-esteem forever , " he said . " I prefer to think of it as saving you from being decapitated by your lovely-but-jealous wife , " I replied . " How \'s my favorite sex maniac ? " " Better for hearing from you . When you coming down , so I can chase you around the desk ? " " As soon as I get a new pair of running shoes . In the meantime , I need some help . " I explained my problem to him . " So if you had a thirty-foot Catalina you did n\'t want found , where would you put it that would still be within an hour or two of Oakland ? " " Well , not one of the bigger marinas . We check registration and all that stuff pretty carefully . I \'d go to an older , private marina , one where they want your money badly enough not to ask too many questions . " " And where would you find such a place ? " " There \'s one or two on           the Sacramento River to someplace in the delta . There \'s plenty of private places up there . I might scrape the registration numbers off my boat , maybe even the name , but unless there was time to repaint the sucker , you \'d probably still be able to read them from where the paint faded . " " Is there a directory with the names and phone numbers of those places ? " " I do n\'t know of one offhand , but I have a bunch of numbers here . You planning on calling marinas ? " " That was the plan , " I said . " I do n\'t know how much luck you \'ll have . We harbor masters do n\'t just give out information , especially not on paying customers . " " Actually , I was going to identify myself as your new assistant . " He laughed . " The day I make enough to hire an assistant , I \'ll be too old to enjoy the interviews . " p138 It was my turn to laugh . " So how           missing boat is in their marina ? " I asked . " You can tell them you \'re a friend of mine , that might help . But the truth is never as much fun as a good fib . Why do n\'t you tell them that the owner of the boat stiffed me for fees and you \'re helping me find him . " " Sounds good to me , " I said . " Thanks , I really appreciate it . " " Think nothing of it . I \'m planning on calling you the next time some guy really does stiff me . " I could n\'t see asking Larry to read me all the telephone numbers he had over the phone . Jesse would have suggested that he fax them , but I knew Larry . He probably did n\'t own a microwave ; he definitely would n\'t have a fax . It \'s my belief that almost anything you want to know can be found in some book , and the real challenge is finding that book . A call to Rand McNally confirmed that           private , on the West Coast , and they had one copy in stock . I sent Amy for the book , and asked Chris to come give me an update on what was happening with Jesse \'s undercover job . " This is taking longer than it should . What \'s going on ? " I asked . " We think something spooked them , " she said . " Jesse \'s playing it extra careful , that \'s why he has n\'t come in since last week . He \'s coming up tonight to see Claire , so he \'ll stop by here sometime after six . He was hoping to meet with you then . " " I \'ll be here , " I said . " Do you need anything from me on this case ? " She shook her head . " We just need these folks to make a move . " " Well , when that happens , let me know . It makes me nervous to be sitting this one out . " p139 Chris handles Amy \'s desk when she \'s           she wants information , she \'s just slightly more pleasant than Leona Helmsley as a receptionist . " There \'s a Kevin Doyle here to see you . He says he \'s a reporter . He does not have an appointment , " she announced . The tone of her voice was only a few degrees above freezing . I figured that the poor guy would never get up the courage to come back , so I told her to send him in . Kevin Doyle had more freckles than I can remember seeing on a grown man . He was covered with them -- face , arms , hands . I do n\'t know about anywhere else , but I \'d bet they were there , too . His hair was red and sort of curly , and he had a Tom Sawyer grin . His parents obviously had n\'t believed that boys needed their teeth straightened , so his upper jaw looked like it had too many teeth competing for too little room . Instead of detracting from his appearance , the crooked teeth came across as a           to late twenties . He was surprisingly well dressed for a newspaperman . His pants had a single crease down each leg instead of the spider web or wrinkles that my friend Max Siedman manages to impress on every pair of slacks he owns . His shirt was actually tucked in all the way around . He handed me his press credentials and explained that he was a reporter for the Chronicle on special assignment . " That means they put me on a slightly longer leash , " he confided . " I \'m doing a series on child abuse , and I \'ve gotten interested in pedophiles . The stereotype is that these are guys in dirty raincoats who lurk around bus stations , but they \'re often highly respected members of the community . But then you know that , " he said with a knowing look . What I know is never to tell a reporter anything you do n\'t want to see in print . I kept my expression neutral . Doyle was undeterred . " I understand that the juvenile sex- p140 crimes unit           " he said . " And I understand that you had something to do with it . " " Mr. Doyle , " I said , " I never comment on my cases to anyone outside my office , especially not to reporters . " He waited for me to say more . I did n\'t . He just kept sitting there looking at me expectantly . He was waiting for me to get uncomfortable with the silence , so I \'d say something to fill it . I use that maneuver all the time . I did n\'t appreciate being on the receiving end . I stood up and extended my hand to signal that the interview was over . " I \'m sorry that I ca n\'t help you . I \'ll look forward to reading your articles . " He remained seated . I remained standing . " Ms. Sayler , from what I hear , you care deeply about abuse of this kind . Surely you wo n\'t just turn your back and let this man get away with his crime . " " I told           cases with reporters . " He shrugged his shoulders , gave me an engaging **25;0;TOOLONG grin , and finally got up to go . At the door , he stopped and took out a business card . " If you change your mind , or you know someone who wants to make sure that the truth gets told , please give me a call . " I had the feeling as he left that I was n\'t going to get rid of Kevin Doyle that easily . It had taken less than forty-eight hours for him to learn about the search warrant . I expected that rumors must be flying around the courthouse , but I also knew that only the insiders would hear them . Kevin Doyle had excellent sources someplace . There were more marinas in the Bay Area than I \'d guessed , especially when you included the ones in the Sacramento River delta . I spent so much time on the phone that my ear hurt , and p141 I began to fear that the telephone would grow onto the side of my head . It           all . Most were friendly and cooperative when I mentioned Larry \'s name , but none of them had seen the Jolly Roger . Several harbor masters at smaller , private facilities did n\'t know Larry and would n\'t talk to me . I could drive to each of those marinas , or I could take the easy way out . I could send Chris . She \'d prefer being out of the office to going over Anton Glosser \'s financial records , and she \'d actually enjoy flirting with strange men and getting them to tell her things . I got tired of that one a long time ago . I asked her to bring me the Glosser file and catch me up on what she \'d found . " Hard to say yet , " she said . " Most of what I \'ve found looks pretty clean , but there are a couple of things to raise questions about . They have to do with some limited partnerships where Glosser \'s listed as one of the general partners . Two of these partnerships have ownership structures that           owned by Y and Z , who are owned by A , B , and C , who are owned by . . . " She shrugged . " When things get that complicated , you have to wonder why . " The other partnerships look solid -- property management , real estate , a couple of small electronics ventures , that sort of thing . Ownership \'s pretty straightforward . I \'ve checked on the other general partners , and they \'re just who you \'d expect -- a couple of relatives , his wife , and the major investors in his company . There \'s only one guy who does n\'t fit , a Milton Diesman . " She shuffled through the file , and pulled out a sheet of paper . " Diesman is himself the general partner in a long list of limited partnerships , many of which are obviously real estate deals . I have n\'t had a chance to check on them , but one name was familiar -- Sunnyside Properties . Ring any bells ? " " More like sirens , " I           folks we nailed in a pro bono case just after you p142 came on staff almost three years ago . Remember the Tenderloin SRO hotel where the owner cut off the heat in December ? That was owned by Sunnyside . They \'re slumlords . " She gave a low whistle . " You mean our boy \'s a slumlord ? " " His friend Diesman could be . It \'s worth checking on Sunnyside and Diesman . " " I have one more thing for you , " Chris said . I waited while she pulled out another paper . " I checked the newspaper file on Dialogue . Two references to Glosser in the Chronicle in the last six months . He was elected president of the German-American Association , and he \'s involved in trying to put together some kind of trading deal with Germany . He \'s been working with the State Department , might be headed into politics . " " Really , " I said . " A place where the appearance of propriety is required , at least in order to get in           answering machine . When I picked up my messages , her voice informed me that she was going to " hang out " with some of her friends and would be back that evening . I wondered about the friends . Were they the vampire twins or someone from school ? And what exactly did hang out mean to kids in the nineties ? I was beginning to feel real empathy for Marion . Jesse got there about six-fifteen . He was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans , and he \'d gotten a haircut that made him look very hip and about nineteen years old . " Is this the International Harvester look ? " I asked . " You like it ? I wanted to catch people \'s attention , maybe speed things up a bit . Claire hates it . " " You look like someone I \'d cross the street to avoid , " I said . That \'s a compliment in our business . We went over what was happening down in Sunnyvale . The p143 answer was not much . " I been making           running me into the poorhouse . And I know they checked out my room over a week ago , so I do n\'t know what \'s holding them up . " " Any chance they \'ve made you ? " " Nah . I do n\'t think so . It just does n\'t feel like that . The guys I figure as contacts , they \'re still real friendly , and they \'re still dropping hints that maybe they know how a bright , not-too-straight guy could make some real money . " " Just be careful . Maybe I should be running backup . I think things are about to come together up here , at least on part of the case . " Jesse shook his head . " Sometimes it \'s more dangerous to have backup than to go it alone . " I knew he was right . When you \'re working alone , you only have to worry about not screwing up ; add another person and you have to worry about them , too . " So tell me about Anton Glosser . That           said . " Nothing yet . Chris has found enough to make me think I might find something if I dig deeper . Peter \'s talked with an attorney who thinks that Maureen Merrick may have cause to sue the county for negligence . I \'d rather see her get the money out of Glosser . " " Where does this thirst for vengeance come from ? I thought you did n\'t believe in that sort of thing . How does that square with your aikido ? " " Aikido is about experiencing the consequences of your actions . You try to hit me , you end up on the floor . Glosser took an action when he double-crossed Orrin Merrick . I just want him to experience the consequences . " " No turning the other cheek , huh ? " " Not when it encourages a man like Glosser to hit the next poor soul who irritates him . " p144 I awoke Tuesday morning to the sound of rain . Four years of drought have sharpened our appreciation of what used to be regarded as a general           for celebration . On barren hillsides in Marin , New Agers perform rain rituals , and I have friends who refuse to carry umbrellas out of the superstitious belief that their lack of protection will somehow hasten a downpour . Molly seemed unusually cheerful at breakfast , and even Peter managed a minimal effort at conversation . Stone took the rain as a sign that he \'d better store up more fat for winter , and made a nuisance of himself until I dumped him out the back door . He took one look at the puddles in the backyard and dashed between my legs back into the kitchen . Stone believes that water should be confined to bowls and toilets . I took my umbrella to the office , just to be ornery and because I find the rain a whole lot more pleasant when it \'s not dripping down my neck . Larry Davis called around ten . " A friend of mine , Charlie Milkin , from up the delta , called . He \'d lost your number , but he thinks he \'s found your boat           He was driving over to his cousin \'s yesterday and went by a place upriver used to be owned by a family with two boats . Present owners just have a small motor boat , and the second slip is usually empty . Only right now it has a pretty little Catalina sloop there . Charlie went over to take a closer look , and the name \'s gone , but you can still see where the paint \'s faded around the letters . It \'s the Jolly Roger , all right . " " Larry , you \'re a prince . I \'ll take you and your lovely wife to dinner the next time I \'m down your way . What \'s Charlie \'s number ? " " Pam \'s on a diet , but I know a great place with candlelight and soft music . " " Dinner , Larry , no dessert . Now , what \'s the number ? " Charlie Milkin was delighted to help . He told me all about the last guy who \'d slipped out without paying for repairs . " Guy           a rubber ball . But he \'d been talking about going to San Luis , and I got friends down there . They called the cops . Turned out this guy owed marinas up and down the coast . He \'d even used fake papers to get the loan to buy the boat . He \'ll be making license plates for a while . " Charlie gave me directions to the boat and promised not to let anyone know we were onto it . I passed the information to Steve Marley . He tipped the cops in Oakland . He asked if I \'d like him to tag along on the search . I figured that meant he was anxious to escape cleaning out closets at home , so I said yes . I did n\'t get a lot of work done during the next several hours . My attention kept straying to the phone . We must have gotten a dozen calls before the one I was waiting for . p146 Steve Marley \'s voice was jubilant . " We found it , " he announced . " Boxes           back at the station , but just the stuff from the first box would be enough for an indictment . There \'s a diary . Reiter was into flowery descriptions of his affairs . His own writing \'ll be enough to convict him . And the diary seems to have some kids \' names , so tracing recent victims wo n\'t be that hard . " " Did you tell them to look for anything that might tie him to Mitch \'s death ? " " I did , and they \'ll contact homicide if anything at all shows up . I should think that Judge Samuel Reiter is only a few hours away from being arrested . " Joe was not as excited by my news as I \'d expected . He gave a long sigh and said , " So it \'s finally over . " I hated to tell him that it was n\'t anywhere near over . Reiter would probably plea-bargain , but he was a public figure and the media were bound to make a circus out of the whole thing . " I do           , " I said . " That is , unless they find something linking Reiter to Mitch \'s murder . It sounds like they have more than enough to make the child-molestation charges . " I hate to admit it , but I \'m just a bit superstitious . A part of me believes in omens and runs of luck . When things are going , my way , I buy a lottery ticket . When they \'re not , I \'m especially careful in crossing the street . Today I bought a lottery ticket on my way to another AA meeting . The lottery ticket was n\'t a winner , but the meeting made up for that . It was led by a short , dark-haired man with a pockmarked face who introduced himself as Mel R. I closed my eyes and p147 listened to his voice to see if it matched the one on Mitch \'s phone tape . I could n\'t be sure . The topic of Mel \'s talk was transcending the past . As he related how his uncle had gotten him drunk to draw           I knew I \'d found Mitch \'s sponsor . Who else but a former victim could have served Mitch in that role , and who better than the quiet self-assured man who was leading today \'s meeting ? Mel finished his talk with a plea to let go of past wrongs . " The past is a great excuse when you \'re looking for a reason to drink , " he said . " But you have to let it go . Living in the present is hard enough without carrying the burdens of the past along , too . " When he asked for questions or comments , I ran through the speech I \'d made at earlier AA meetings . I tried to change it each time , since I \'d seen some of the same people at several meetings , but I did n\'t have to change it a lot . This was a group that understood that problems do n\'t go away fast and some wounds need a lot of telling to be cleansed . After the meeting , Mel R. came up to me and           " he said . " You have to go on . " " I feel so guilty , " I said . " All that does n\'t matter . You have to put it behind you . " His voice was warm but authoritative ; he was just the kind of person I could see a man like Mitch turning to for help . " You ca n\'t let the past become an excuse for taking the next drink , " he continued . " A drunk can always find an excuse . " " I feel like if I could just ? " A tiny , almost elfin man in his fifties broke in . " I \'m sorry to interrupt , but I need to talk to Mel , " he said . " It \'s really an emergency . " Mel let himself be led aside , and was immediately drawn into an intense interchange that did n\'t look as if it \'d be over soon . After more than a week of searching for Mel , it was all I could do not to grab him           on my dwindling reserves of self-control , I took my p148 sorrows to the coffee table , and hung around trying to resist the urge to reach for one of the doughnuts . A young woman wearing more makeup than she needed drew me into conversation , and in the moments that my attention was distracted , Mel disappeared . I tore outside , then back in to check for other exits . I \'d lost him . I knew where to find him again , but I \'d have to wait a week to do it . Just barely managing not to swear out loud , I took a doughtnut to soothe the frustration and headed for home . The judge \'s arrest was n\'t on the six o\'clock news , but it made the ten o\'clock broadcast . The police had managed the arrest without alerting the media , so Reiter was spared having television cameras pushed in his face while he was being led from his home . This would be the last time he was granted that little bit of dignity . The reporters had n\'t           . They \'d dredged up some old footage of the Good Citizen for Youth Award and made a big thing out of the irony of the situation , making Youth Services and a lot of other valuable organizations look foolish . I fervently hoped they would n\'t go around to the chess and computer clubs and harass the already-confused boys there . " You look pretty glum for someone who just won , " Molly said . I felt pretty glum . " I \'m glad they caught him , " I said . " I \'m just sad for all the kids and their families that were betrayed by him . " " But are n\'t they better off with the judge out of the way ? " she asked . " Sure they are , but it \'s like having someone tell you that you need a tooth pulled . It \'s a good thing to find out before it does any more damage , but it still hurts like hell . " Molly nodded , but I doubted that she really understood . One of the virtues           in terms p149 of doing good , instead of worrying about not causing too much harm . Reiter \'s arrest made the front page of the Chronicle the next morning . The byline was Kevin Doyle \'s . He \'d done a good job with the story . I had to give him credit for that . He \'d hit all the sources I had , and had quotes from most of them , and he had n\'t gone for the cheap shots . He \'d made an effort to portray Samuel Reiter as a complex man instead of a monster , and he \'d tried to provide some information on pedophilia . It was n\'t anything the Man-Boy Love Association would like , but it seemed fair to me . I went to the office ready to get back to business as usual . Kevin Doyle was waiting there when I arrived . " Nice work , " he said . " And to you . I liked your article in the Chron . " He followed me into my office without being asked . " So will you           " No ? Why not ? Reiter \'s under arrest . " " I never talk about my cases with the press . That has n\'t changed , " I said . " Okay , " Doyle said , giving up much too easily . " How about your client ? You must have a client who asked you to look into Reiter . Would your client talk to me ? " I did n\'t know . It occurred to me that Joe might very much like to talk with Kevin . It would provide an opportunity to get some publicity about Mitch \'s murder , and there was always a chance that that might lead to something . " Give me your card again . I \'ll contact my client , and if he or she is interested in talking with you , they \'ll call you , " I said . Kevin grinned and handed me a card . " The number on the back is my home phone . Call anytime , " he said . p150 Joe had seen Kevin \'s article , and after considering           " Just be sure that you do n\'t tell him anything you would n\'t want to see in print , " I said . " There is no such thing as off the record . \' " I spent the morning putting together a final report on the Reiter case , getting Steve Marley \'s hours , so I could cut him a check , and dealing with loose ends . At eleven a new loose end popped up . Carol Bailey from Oakland called . " I think I \'ve found your victim \'s car , " she said . " It \'s on Felman in the three-hundred block . I got the tip from a gal I busted who finds herself in need of bail money . I have n\'t checked to confirm it , but I think the tip \'s good . " " Felman Street ? Is that anywhere near Jerry \'s Bar ? " " No , that \'s the funny part . It \'s in the warehouse district above Jack London Square . That \'s a completely different section of town . " The           car on the way to someplace else , certainly not on the way to Jerry \'s . I felt the surge of adrenaline that kicks in when a case starts to come together . Joe was excited by the discovery of the car . It took him only fifteen minutes to clear his calendar so he could go along with me . On the drive to Oakland , he became more somber . " Does this mean Mitch was murdered by Reiter ? " he asked . " I do n\'t know . Can you think of any reason his car would be in the warehouse district in Oakland ? " He shook his head . " I \'m sure there are explanations , but until we find one it makes Mitch \'s death look all the more suspicious . That \'s for sure . " " It \'s funny , " he said . " I hired you to prove that it was n\'t a random killing , and now that we \'re almost there , I wish it was . " I kept my gaze on the road           to feel the intensity that I knew burned in his eyes . " If it had been a robbery , I would n\'t be responsible . It would n\'t matter that I did n\'t help him . " " Do n\'t beat yourself up , " I said . " You do n\'t know that it \'d been any different if you had helped him . " I thought of Mel R. \'s comment that " living in the present is hard enough without carrying the burdens of the past along , too . " Easier to say than do . Jack London Square is Oakland \'s Fisherman \'s Wharf without the fishermen . It \'s on an estuary of the San Francisco Bay and most of the waterfront property is devoted to restaurants . Inland from the restaurants and cutesy shops is the warehouse district . The businesslike old brick buildings are still in good repair , and the area is slowly being revitalized as new businesses move in . Mitch Morrison \'s old Ford Pinto waited on a street that was on its way up . A couple           into office space . The rest were still solid blue-collar structures . Mitch \'s car was a black Pinto that was probably no stranger to the want ads . It had a dent in one fender and one tire had gone flat . It was still there because it looked too poor to rob and just respectable enough not to be towed . The car was locked , but Joe had found an extra set of keys at Mitch \'s apartment . Inside , the car looked messy , a familiar kind of messy , the kind you generate doing surveillance . There were plastic cups and fast-food containers , a half-empty sack of stale pretzels , a partially eaten bagel , a couple of dirty napkins . I wore plastic gloves to search , and tried not to move things around too much in order not to compromise the police search . A copy of a newpaper added to the clutter . I checked the date . It was an afternoon paper from the day Mitch . died . I found a p152 flashlight , a camera , and           Mitch had used his car to watch someone or something . The scraps of paper were mainly food wrappers , but in the space between the driver \'s seat and the gearshift , I found a piece of notebook paper folded into fourths . On it , JONAH T was printed in block letters , and beneath the name was the number 4736682 . " That \'s Mitch \'s handwriting , " Joe said . " But he never mentioned a Jonah to me . " " What do you make of the number ? " " It \'s pretty long . Could be a serial number or the number of a case file or something like that . " It could be damn near anything , I thought . I counted the digits . Seven . It could be a telephone number . We found another sheet from the same notebook in the glove compartment . Written on it in the same block printing was the name " Reiter , " an address which I recognized as his , and a telephone number that was probably his as well           other side of the paper . I copied down the information on both sheets of paper and replaced them where I \'d found them . They were the only thing in the car that seemed promising . Maybe the cops would have more luck , but I doubted it . I sent Joe back to San Francisco on BART . The location of the car and its contents were the closest we \'d come to finding a clue to what happened the night of Mitch \'s death , and I wanted to learn what I could before the police arrived to start questioning people . In my experience , uniforms and badges tend to produce severe memory loss in susceptible individuals . I did n\'t think it was an accident that Mitch had left the car in this neighborhood . He must have been here for a reason . I had my snapshot of the murdered man and a photo of Samuel p153 Reiter . Now all I needed was someone who \'d seen either one or both of them . In a three-block radius of the car , I           might have been Mitch Morrison . Only one of them seemed sober enough to remember something that happened yesterday , let alone a month ago . That was a woman who worked in a small cafe a couple of blocks from where the car was parked . " Yeah , I remember that scar on his hand , " she said . " Remember wondering how he got it . He came in here asking about something , I think . " " Do you remember what he asked about ? " " No . " She shook her head , then stopped , " Yeah , yeah , it was about a car , I think . Yeah , he wanted to know if I \'d seen this car . " " What kind of car ? " She shrugged . " I do n\'t remember , but I think it was an expensive car -- you know , fancy . I had n\'t seen it around here . " I gave her a business card with a fictitious name on it and the agency \'s unlisted phone number           about the man . I always feel a bit paranoid using fake cards , but there are times when I prefer not to give my own name and number , especially when I \'m looking for a killer . I headed back to my car and was almost mowed down by a tall , thin young man carrying a large cardboard box . He backed out of a doorway and straight into me . " Oh , shit , I \'m sorry , " he said . " Are you okay ? " " I \'m okay , " I said . " Do you work around here ? " " Huh ? Yeah , sometimes . " He was probably in his late twenties and had a dark red patch shaped like a strawberry just above the jawline , on the left side of his face . I showed him the picture of Mitch and asked if he \'d seen him in the neighborhood several weeks ago . " This guy ? Why do you want to know ? " p154 " He left his car near here ,           what he was doing here . " " Oh , sure , " he said and studied the picture again . " Yeah , I think I seen this guy , but almost a month ago . Is there a reward or something ? And who \'re you ? " " I \'m working for the family , and there is a reward for anyone who has real information . Did you talk to him ? " " Yeah , I did . But I do n\'t remember exactly what about . How much reward ? " he asked slyly . " Depends on the information . Did he ask you about a car ? " " Yeah . " He nodded . " Yeah , that \'s what we talked about , a car . He was looking for a car , but I had n\'t seen it . " " What kind of car was he looking for ? " He shrugged . " I do n\'t remember . I guess that \'s not good enough for a reward , huh ? But I \'ll tell you what           phone number , and if I find out anything I \'ll call you . " I pulled out a card and realized as I handed it to him that it was the wrong one . I \'d given him a regular business card with my name and the agency address and phone number on it . A seven-digit number can mean just about anything , but the easiest seven digits to check on are a phone number , so when I got back to the office I dialed the number I \'d found in Mitch \'s car . I got a recording telling me that the service was either turned off for the number I was trying to reach or it was out of my service area . I \'ve gotten that message before . It means you \'ve reached a cellular phone . Jonah T. \'s cellular phone ? I hoped so . The only problem now was that cellular phone numbers are unlisted and damn near impossible to get ahold of unless you have a court order or know someone at the phone company willing to risk their           source at the phone company , but not that good a source . p155 I called Inspector Warren at the Oakland PD , and told him about the car and the papers I \'d found in it . He was not impressed by my skill at figuring out that the mysterious seven digits might be a telephone number , but he did agree to get the information on the number from the phone company . I restrained myself from suggesting he do it sometime before the end of the decade . Time to draw on another brilliant investigative technique . I \'d have to call the number until I got someone on the other end . I could do that while I was n\'t figuring out how to nail Anton Glosser . Jesse called in just before five . " It \'s set to go down Friday night . You want in ? " " Tell me about it , " I said . " I \'m to leave the side door open and make sure that the boxes are stacked against the wall just down from the loading dock           I make sure the right stock gets in the right place . Then I go home , and they pick up the merchandise . " " Have you tipped the cops ? " " Yep . A couple of them will come in tonight and mark all the stock on the wish list and put transmitters in the boxes . Tomorrow I just follow instructions so everything \'s right where the gang expects to find it . The cops \'ll take it from there . " " They \'re going to wait to make the bust , I hope . We want the person who ordered the theft , not the thugs who \'re carrying it out . Try to make sure they do n\'t move before the delivery . " " I \'ve already cleared that , " Jesse said . " They want the big boys behind this as much as we do . They \'ll just watch the stolen parts till they get where they \'re going . " " In the meantime , you \'ll have to stay on the job , " I said .           Believe me , I hope they move quickly . You want to be involved in this in any way ? " p156 Part of me wanted to talk to the cops in Sunnyvale , to go back over the operation . Any screwup on their part could blow all of Jesse \'s hard work and , worse yet , put his life in jeopardy , but I remembered how I \'d felt the first time my former boss , Keith Stone , had let me run an entire operation . " It \'s your show , " I told him . " I \'d just be in the way . Just let me know how things are going . " " Will do , " he said , and I could hear the smile in his voice . p157 The next couple of days held few surprises . Samuel Reiter was released on bail . His cronies who had been so quick to threaten me did not call to apologize . The police found nothing in Mitch \'s car to whet their curiosity . And the secret of Anton Glosser           Sunnyvale was robbed on schedule , and the gang was greedy and careless enough to move the loot straight to the competitor \'s warehouse . The police had rounded up the gang , though there was still some question as to whether they \'d gotten the leader . They \'d arrested one highly placed executive in the competing firm , but they were looking for a bigger fish . Our client had what he wanted , and Jesse was so pleased that he had a hell of a time maintaining his pose as Mr. Cool . It was good to have him back in the office . Friday morning \'s Chronicle carried a follow-up story on Judge Samuel Reiter \'s arrest , again with a byline by Kevin Doyle . The reporter devoted a good deal of space to the suspicious circumstances of Mitch Morrison \'s violent death . He inserted the word alleged at all the right spots , and stayed on p158 the safe side of the libel laws , but he managed to make the connection between Mitch \'s death and his investigation of Reiter look a           He did us another big favor . He included in the story a request that anyone knowing anything about Mitch \'s activities during his last days contact Doyle at the Chron . We had been unable to locate anyone who knew much about what Mitch was up to , yet I felt sure that there must be people who did . Maybe one of them would see the article and call . Steve Marley telephoned as I was going over Jesse \'s report on the Sunnyvale case . " I \'m going over to Oakland to take another look at the stuff from Reiter \'s boat . You want to come along ? " Did I want to look through a pedophile \'s private souvenir collection ? Not hardly . But there was the chance that something in those boxes might provide a clue to Mitch \'s death , so I tried to sound grateful as I thanked him . Steve \'s buddy from the Juvenile Division looked as if he wished I \'d stayed home , but he found us a room where we would n\'t be interrupted .           and a dirty window that looked out on the freeway . He fussed a bit and delivered a set of instructions that translated as " Do n\'t let the civilian screw anything up " ; then he and Steve went to claim the boxes that would send Samuel Reiter to jail . The four boxes they lugged in were only part of the total haul from the boat . Steve \'s buddy dropped his boxes on the table and announced , " They \'re all yours . Just check them back in when you \'re through , " and hurried out of the room . Steve put three of the cardboard boxes on the floor , sat the fourth on the table between us and began to sort through it . There were hundreds of snapshots , all of boys . He dropped a pile in front of me . " Let \'s see how good you are at this kind of thing . What do these tell you ? " p159 I picked up a handful and looked through them , then laid them out on the table in           the kind parents carry in their wallets ; but in most the boys were naked . Some struck provocative poses ; others tried to look casual , as if there was nothing out of the ordinary about their nudity . When you looked at them all together , certain similarities emerged . The boys were all about the same age , somewhere between nine and eleven . Their body types were similar -- on the small side with little bony chests . All were white , and most were towheads with a sprinkling of freckles across their noses , the kind of kid Norman Rockwell loved to paint . There were a number of redheads and several dark-eyed Latin types , but the majority were strikingly similar . I picked up a picture of a strawberry blond , freckle-faced youngster who was wearing only a Mickey Mouse T-shirt . He stood with one foot on a tree stump and offered an uncertain , crooked-toothed smile for the camera . He was the kid down the block , the upstart in the fourth grade , Tom Sawyer in the school play           fish or a baseball bat , not posing for Samuel Reiter \'s private collection . " He likes boys between nine and eleven , white , average build , and prefers blonds with freckles , " I said . I looked away from the faces and was struck by the vulnerability of the skinny legs and knobby knees , liberally decorated with the scrapes and scabs that are the badges of boyhood adventures . " Yep , " Marley said . " But you missed the backgrounds . Most were taken in the woods or on a sailboat . We \'ll check the interior shots ; they \'re probably from his house . " He was holding a notebook he \'d pulled from the box . " One of Reiter \'s journals , " he said . " You might find it interesting . " Reiter wrote in a spidery , cramped hand , but it was fairly easy to decipher . The first entry described a boy who \'d just joined his soccer team . The writing was flowery , like something p160 from a cheap romantic novel .           \'s infatuation with the boy was apparent . I flipped to a later page and found an entry with a different tone . I often wonder if things would have been different if I had n\'t met Craig . What if I \'d played Little League instead of joining the Boy Scouts ? Or what if I \'d joined another troop ? Would I feel this attraction to boys if Craig had n\'t introduced me to it ? The " experts " would place the blame on him , but what do they really know ? Do they know why he chose me , instead of someone else ? Did he see something , know something about me that even I did n\'t realize ? I showed the journal to Steve . " Reiter was a victim , too , " I said . Steve read the page and nodded . " You \'d be surprised how many times I \'ve read passages just like that . I told you that these guys were former victims . In fact , a lot of what we know about peds comes from           me and I read on as he sorted through the contents of several boxes . Pages of selfdenunciation and loathing alternated with pathetic , self-serving efforts at justification . At times , Reiter clearly saw the damage he was doing to his " loves " and swore he \'d stop , but subsequent passages revealed that not only had he been unable to quit , but he was busy planning the seduction of a new boy . I followed his infatuation with a boy named Brad who was the son of his law clerk . He described in loving detail conversations and outings , the exchange of confidences and other signs of growing trust and intimacy . There were pages of descriptions of how Brad combed his hair , his casual gestures and favorite expressions , the way he sat or stood or ran . That was the touching , almost sweet , part . There were also p161 sections so explicit and prurient as to be pornographic . I skipped those . Toward the end of the journal I came across an entry that caught my attention . Spent           They were so worldly , so unabashed in their sexuality . I was both fascinated and repelled . K. is my dark side . He is the most completely amoral man I have ever known . I ca n\'t imagine him tormenting himself with guilt and remorse the way I do . I do n\'t trust him , do n\'t even like him , yet I am drawn back to him like a moth to a flame . " What do you make of this ? " I asked Steve . He read it , then handed back the book . " A buddy . It \'s not unusual . These guys find each other . They \'ll trade pictures , write to each other about their affairs . Sometimes they even pass kids along . When a kid gets too old for one guy , he gets introduced to a buddy who likes older kids . " We spent several hours , and I skimmed through a couple of diaries , but I found nothing that told me whether Samuel Reiter had played any role in Mitch Morrison \'s           n\'t have faced another page of Reiter \'s private obsessions . That evening Molly wanted to go to a party , but when I asked whose parents would be there , she just laughed . " Parents do n\'t hang around parties , " she informed me . " Even in Palo Alto , lots of times they go out for the evening . " " And leave a house full of fourteen-year-olds on their own ? " " Lots of the kids at this party are older . " That \'s when I realized that interrogation skills might be useful in raising a teenager . It took a lot more questions , most met p162 with evasive answers , to discover that the party was being given by the vampire twins . Molly was indignant when I said no . I tried to explain the dangers of the streets . She was unimpressed . " Goll , " she said , and rolled her eyes , " you \'d think I was a baby . You \'re so paranoid , Catherine . Not every person out there is a           are cool , like that guy across the street who gave us a ride down to Polk Street yesterday afternoon . " I should have asked , " What guy ? " Should have wondered why a stranger would walk up and talk to three girls coming out of my house on a Thursday afternoon . But I was so busy trying to explain the general dangers of urban America that I missed completely a very specific one much closer to home . The weekend was a disaster . Molly was furious that I had n\'t let her go to the party , and the fragile relationship that we \'d begun to build when she first arrived had eroded as I spent long hours at the office . She went off with the vampire twins both days and came back spoiling for a fight . Even fairly innocuous requests that she turn down her music or rinse her dishes were met with angry tirades or sullen sulks . I felt like I was living in the middle of a minefield . Peter was as tired of his role as peacemaker           found more reasons to be away from home . I missed him and was silently furious for his defection . By Monday morning I was ready to send Molly back to Marion . I \'d decided that they deserved each other . I did n\'t delude myself that sending Molly home would solve her problems , but it would mean that one less person would be miserable , and since that person was me , it seemed like a good plan . I was figuring out how to effect the reunion of mother and daughter when Arthur Costa called . I know Arthur only indi- p163 rectly ; Peter \'s worked for him and has some very entertaining stories about Costa \'s courtroom antics . He is a highly respected , somewhat eccentric , defense lawyer who has won more than his share of lost causes . " Ms. Sayler , I \'m representing Joe Girard , " he said . He had a marvelous voice , radio-announcer perfect with the trace of an accent I could n\'t identify . " I understand that Mr. Girard retained you on a           I said warily . A call from Arthur Costa suggested that the week that had started so poorly was about to get even worse . " That \'s correct . " " I wonder if you could manage to see me today . It \'s a matter of some urgency . Joe has been arrested for the murder of Judge Reiter . " It took a minute for the words to penetrate , and when they did , I felt as if someone had knocked the breath out of me . " The murder of Judge Reiter ? " I stammered . " Yes . I assume you have n\'t heard of it . " Monday mornings are hard enough without starting them off with a dose of the news . I rarely listen to the radio , and this morning I \'d even skipped the front page of the Chronicle . " No , I had n\'t heard . Can you tell me what happened ? " " Judge Reiter was found dead in his study early Sunday morning . He \'d been struck on the head with a           ? " " Yes . They can place Joe at Reiter \'s house at eight Saturday night . Death occurred sometime between eight and ten . Joe has made no secret of his belief that Reiter is responsible for his cousin \'s death . They have motive and opportunity . Enough for an arrest . They arraigned him this morning . He \'s being held without bail . " I tried to make sense of what he was telling me . It was shocking enough that Samuel Reiter was dead , but the idea that Joe might have killed him was even more disturbing . " What does Joe say ? " I asked . p164 " He says he \'s innocent , that he left the house about twenty minutes after he arrived , and Reiter was alive at that time . " I did n\'t ask if Costa believed Joe ; it \'s not a relevant question for a defense attorney . Costa \'s job was n\'t to decide on Joe \'s guilt or innocence , but simply to provide him with the best defense possible . "           " The judge had an assistant who admitted Joe at eight , then left shortly thereafter . He discovered Reiter \'s body when he returned home this morning . " An assistant . That had to be the tall young man who \'d opened the door the night I visited Reiter . " Joe has asked that I retain you as my investigator in this case . I \'m agreeable to that if you \'re willing to take the case . " " You know that I do n\'t usually do criminal work . " " Yes , and I \'ve discussed that with Joe . He \'s most adamant that he wants you to continue . Your rates are somewhat higher than my regular investigator \'s , but I \'ll pay them . " Very generous , except that Arthur Costa would n\'t be paying my rates , he \'d be billing them to Joe . A well-known San Francisco lawyer , when asked how much it cost for a first-degreemurder defense , once responded , " Whatever you \'ve got . " I feared that was what Joe           " I \'ll take the case , " I told Costa . " Did you say that they \'ve denied Joe bail ? " " That \'s correct . It \'s outrageous . A combination of bad luck and worse timing . The judge we drew is tough under the best of circumstances , but only a week ago he released a man on bail who subsequently shot his wife . " " But this is a first offense , and Joe \'s a member of the bar . Ca n\'t you appeal ? " " I \'m doing that , but since the victim is a public official , it \'s a special-circumstances situation , and they are within their p165 rights to deny bail . I am not optimistic about our chances of a reversal . " I \'d like you to see Joe today if you can . Take him through his activities on the night of the murder in as much detail as possible . Tape the interview . I can see you at three this afternoon . Let my secretary know if you ca n\'t           and tried to absorb the information I \'d just been given . Reiter \'s death was a shock , but it was Joe I was worried about . Was it possible that he had killed Samuel Reiter ? Anyone can kill , and Joe had plenty of reason to hate the judge , but I could n\'t imagine him as a killer . Joe believed in the law the way Catholics believe in the Eucharist . I just could n\'t see him taking it into his own hands . The thought of Joe in jail filled me with fear . Joe would not do well in jail . In fact , he might not survive it . He was n\'t a guy who knew how to back off or keep a low profile , and he had a bad attitude toward authority . He \'d alienate the guards , then he \'d side with some poor , weak inmate against the more powerful , predatory cons who called the shots . No one would be surprised when he became a jailhouse casualty . Working for Joe was supposed to help           back all my feelings of anger and helplessness . Only this time I was n\'t helpless . I made myself a promise that Joe was not going to end up like Orrin . Joe was being held at the Oakland jail , a formidable square tower with slits for windows that squatted next to the Nimitz Freeway . It \'s a classic example of the concrete block construction so common to buildings dealing with law and order . I do n\'t know whether the designers wanted it to be ugly , depressing , or intimidating , but they achieved all three . I checked in , and was taken to the attorney \'s booth , which p166 was really a glass cage facing another glass cage , next to several more pairs of glass cages . In the cage next to me a small black man in his forties talked with his client , a tired-looking guy who could have had a job on celebrity wrestling . The little guy did a lot of hand waving , but it was all motion and no sound . I sat in the           no one was looking at me . Just being this close to confinement made me jumpy . I thought first of Orrin , then of Joe . As if cued by my thoughts , the door in the cubicle opposite to me opened , and Joe walked in and sat down . He looked pale and drawn . He seemed to have lost weight since I \'d last seen him . " How \'re you holding up ? " I asked . " I \'ve been in jail before , " he said cockily . He waited for a response , then shrugged . " Okay , civil disobedience is different from murder one . And I hate jail , thank you . I \'ve always hated jail . But you want to know something funny , the guards have been nicer to Joe Girard , the killer , than they ever were to Joe Girard , the good citizen . " He gave a mirthless laugh . " My roommate is a twenty-year-old who shot two people in a SevenEleven . A real nice guy . " I nodded           people you \'d most like to avoid , and you get to meet them when they \'re at their most angry and have the least reason to restrain themselves . It does n\'t take a lot of imagination to understand why prison holds such terror for the weak and defenseless . " Tell me what happened the night you went to Reiter \'s , " I said . " I assume that whatever I tell you is covered by attorneyclient privilege . " " It is . I \'m working for your attorney , " I said , bracing myself for a confession . " I have n\'t told the police about what Reiter did to me . They still think that my only connection with him is through Mitch . " p167 " Have you told your lawyer ? " " Not really . " " Joe , there is n\'t any room for not really \' when you \'re putting together a murder defense . Arthur needs to know the whole thing . " " I \'m not telling anyone else about it . That \'s the way           out , then lowered my voice , " this is a murder charge , and a very substantial one , that you \'re facing . If you do n\'t want to spend the rest of your life in jail , you \'d better stop worrying about what happened to you as a kid and start worrying about what \'s going to happen to you as an adult . " The way his jaw tightened and set told me he was n\'t about to listen to me . " Telling the cops what happened would just give them a better motive , " he said . " It does n\'t help my case any . " " You still need to tell Arthur . " " You do it . I do n\'t want to talk about it , " Joe said grimly . " What happened at Reiter \'s ? " I asked . " He called me around seven and asked if we could meet . I did n\'t want to . Shit , I \'ve worked for years to put all this behind me . But he was           both of us . " Joe looked down for a moment and wiped one hand across his eyes . " I do n\'t know why I went . It sure as hell was n\'t because I thought it \'d help . Maybe I just wanted to see him squirm . " The assistant was there when I arrived , but he must have gone out because he was n\'t around when I left . Anyway , Sam was pretty loaded . He offered me a drink , and I took one . He was refilling his glass before mine was half empty . " It was all right at first . I mean he wanted to know what I \'d done with myself , was pleased that I \'d chosen the law . He played the proud father like he \'d done when I was a kid . The more he talked , the more pissed off I felt . I was about to tell him he was full of shit when he started telling me it was his influence that had made me what I am , how nobody           . The bastard wanted me to say that what he \'d done was okay , that it was really good . " I exploded . I told him that was bullshit , and that he did n\'t know how much he \'d hurt me . That he \'d totally screwed up Mitch . I wanted to tell him the whole thing -- the years of therapy , all the relationships I \'ve screwed up just when they were getting good , the loneliness , the never trusting anyone , God , all of it . But he did n\'t want to listen . " He started yelling at me . I do n\'t even know what he said , because by then I was so angry I could n\'t listen to him anymore . I threw my glass at him -- I think it broke on his desk ? then I just walked out . I got in my car and drove around for hours before I came home . " " And the next day the police arrested you . " " Yeah . I was there , and           . He was still yelling when I went out the door . " " Was there anyone in the house when you left ? " " I did n\'t see anyone . " " But he called you ; that \'s why you went to see him ? " " Yeah . " " We \'ll have to get access to his phone records for that night , " I said . " We need to know who else he called . " " You mean he might have called the killer , just like he did me ? Why ? " " From what you say , he was distraught , anxious to talk . If he called you , he may well have called other victims or their families . Maybe he got someone who was less able to control his anger than you are . " Joe nodded . " Yeah , that \'s a real possibility . He seemed to need me to tell him that what he \'d done was okay , that it was no big deal . " He shook his head in           he called someone else . Someone he knew could be manipulated to give him the answers he wanted . " " Or someone he knew would blow up , " Joe suggested . " As p169 I think about it , he was more than drunk , he was depressed . Maybe he was looking for someone to whack him . " " A cowardly suicide ? It \'s possible , " I said , " but I doubt that it \'ll play well in court . What did you do after you left ? " " I just drove around for a long time , first around Piedmont , then out Highway 24 to Walnut Creek and back . I needed to cool off and get myself together . " " Anyone see you ? " Joe shook his head . " I do n\'t think so . " I took him back through the whole day , from the time he put on his socks to when he climbed in bed . I took notes and got it all on tape . There was n\'t much on which           asked me to find a murderer three weeks ago ; now the alleged killer was dead , and Joe needed his own defense against a murder charge . Another three weeks on this job and maybe I \'d be in jail . The trend was not in the right direction . I got back to the city a little before two o\'clock , too early for my meeting with Arthur Costa , enough time to check in at the office . Amy informed me that I looked as though my favorite cat had died , and I probably should not see any clients in my current condition . I knew the situation was serious when she offered to fix me a cup of tea . She handed me four pink message slips . Not surprisingly , one was from Kevin Doyle . I hate to see cases tried in the press , but there are times when access to the media is important , and Kevin had shown himself to be a thoughtful and intelligent reporter . It might be very handy to have him on our side . Still           talked with Arthur Costa . I did call the mysterious seven-digit number I \'d found in Mitch \'s car . I \'d gotten the recording so many times that I was p171 startled when a human voice answered . The voice was masculine , low and fairly gruff . " Yes . " " Jonah ? " I said , hoping the name and number were connected by more than coincidence . " What ? Who is this ? " the voice demanded . " I was trying to call Jonah . Is this the right number ? " " Who \'s calling ? " Suspicion and a hint of hostility hardened the voice . It told me that there was some connection between the name and number . I doubted that the man I was speaking to was Jonah . His reaction to the name was wrong , but he knew Jonah and had some reason to distrust anyone who mentioned him . " This is Catherine Small , " I said , using one of the names I \'d developed for situations like this . " Who \'s           " " I want to talk to him . Can you tell me how to get ahold of him ? " " Give me your number . I \'ll have him call you . " I gave him the unlisted office number . He would n\'t be able to trace it back to me , and if he called , we \'d be expecting him . I called Arthur Costa \'s office and was told to come right on over . The address was downtown in one of the skyscrapers that keep sprouting around the Embarcadero . Costa \'s not a Belli or Hallinan or Erlich , one of those men who create legends and end up in Herb Caen \'s column for their clever one-liners , but he is well known and highly respected among the legal community . He \'s been mentioned for the bench more than once , and the next time the powers that be are looking for a Spanishsurname judge , they may well look his way . They \'d probably have tapped him much sooner if his sharp tongue and independent mind had n\'t           file on Joe and headed for Costa \'s office . As I drove downtown I realized that I was n\'t looking forward to p172 working for Arthur Costa . I do n\'t work for lawyers . I work for the people who hire lawyers , and that means the lawyers have to be reasonably polite to me . I like to call the shots . I had a hunch Arthur Costa did , too . Costa \'s office was decorated in a style I call tasteful-expensive . It comes in modern and traditional , and he \'d chosen the traditional version with lots of heavy wood and brass , thick carpeting , and paintings of dogs and horses on the wood-paneled walls . I suppose it makes his clients feel secure to know that their lawyer is so well-heeled . It \'d just make me feel poorer . Costa was in his late forties , and the years showed around his middle but not in the thick dark hair that he left cut just slightly long . His face was roundish and dominated by thick eyebrows that slanted down to           \'d take him for a mild-mannered accountant . He seated me on a large leather couch and took the armchair next to it ; his secretary brought us coffee . I do envy unliberated employers who can get away with asking their secretaries to make coffee . Amy would just ask solicitously if I \'d hurt my arm . Costa had me go over my work for Joe from the beginning , and as he probed and questioned the mild-mannered accountant disappeared , and I got a taste of the sharp mind behind his bland brown eyes . I decided that working for Arthur Costa might be fun after all . When I told Costa that Joe had been abused by Reiter , he restrained himself to a heartfelt " Damn , " then demanded , " Who else knows this ? " " Joe \'s been in therapy for it , so his therapist knows . Beyond that , I doubt that he \'s told anyone . " " No need for it to come out , then , " Costa said . " It just provides the prosecution           my investigation . He considered what I \'d told him . " I know you \'re not experienced at this , " he said , " but how would you go about constructing a defense ? " p173 " Joe does n\'t remember much about where he drove after leaving Reiter \'s , so there \'s not much chance of developing a credible alibi . I \'m used to looking for the guilty party , so I \'d want to know who else might have visited Reiter that night . It was only a few days after his arrest . There must be a number of parents who just discovered that their sons were molested , maybe even some adults for whom the arrest brought back painful memories . " " Reasonable doubt , " Costa said . " It \'s a weak defense . " " There \'s the wife . Joe did n\'t see her ; he does n\'t think she was home , but I \'ll check on her . And there \'s the assistant . If he \'s the man I met at Reiter \'s ,           former victim . It \'s not unusual for a pedophile to continue his relationship with boys after the sexual liaison ends . He could have been jealous or afraid of exposure . " Costa nodded . I continued . " Then there \'s the issue of Mitch \'s death . Two murder victims connected to each other ; you have to wonder if the killer might be the same person . " " But you do n\'t have anything on Mitch \'s killer . " " No . " I had a feeling that Mel R. from AA might know something , but it was too early to tell . " I \'d like to keep working on that angle . I might be getting close to someone who knew what Mitch was doing , but I wo n\'t know for a day or two , maybe more . " " Well , one of the things I want you to do is develop alternate suspects . But there are some fairly routine jobs that I \'ll need from you first . I \'ll want you to gather the discovery           the DA \'s Office . He \'ll give you copies of the police reports , information from the technicians and the lab , autopsy protocol , photos , taped statements . My secretary will give you a letter authorizing you to receive them . " I groaned inwardly at the name Tom Roselli . He was an old friend of my ex-husband , Dan Walker . Both Dan and Tom had started out on the SFPD . Dan had stayed and risen to homicide p174 inspector . Tom had left to work for the District Attorney \'s Office . The DA \'s Office is a lot easier than working the street . It \'s as close as you come to a nine-to-five job in law en-forcement . Knowing the inspector in charge ought to have been a help , except that Tom had never recovered from a bad case of male chauvinism imparted by his Italian father . He was capable of making cracks about keeping women barefoot and pregnant without the least embarrassment , and he was the only man I knew who referred to me as " the           refuse to take me seriously or act openly hostile because of the divorce , probably both . Costa continued . " The way we work , you \'re my eyes and ears , you understand . You go to the police property room and look at any evidence they \'ve got . It \'s usually just routine , but maybe you \'ll see something that is n\'t quite right or raises questions . You do n\'t even need to know why it feels funny , just tell me if it does . A feeling can be the beginning of a theory . " I \'ll want a statement from the assistant . And start digging to see if there \'s anything to your hunch about him being a past victim . Get a statement from the wife , even if she was n\'t there that night , and from the neighbors , and anybody else who might know something . " I \'ll subpoena the phone company to provide us with Judge Reiter \'s phone records for the last week and to reveal the name that goes with the phone           take it down today , and with luck they \'ll have the information for us in a day or two . They can try to quash the subpoena , but I do n\'t think we \'ll have a problem . " I told Costa about Kevin Doyle and showed him a copy of Kevin \'s story in the Chronicle . " Do you want me to talk to him , or should I avoid him ? " Costa pursed his lips and considered it . " He could conceivably be useful at some point -- not yet , I think , but maybe in p175 the future . Try to stay on good terms with him . Do n\'t tell him anything unless you clear it with me first . " As we were finishing up Costa said , " I get the impression that you \'re a friend of Joe \'s . " " Yes , " I said . " He \'s a friend as well as a colleague . " Costa nodded . " Yes , I also consider him a friend . He does good work           hate to see him go to jail . " " I think jail for a man like Joe could be a death sentence , " I said , giving voice to a fear that had haunted me all day . Costa nodded . His expression was grave . " He would make the wrong kind of enemies , I think . " " On both sides . " " Yes , on both sides . That \'s why it \'s imperative that we keep him out of jail . " " I \'ll do my best to help you do that , " I said , praying that my best would be good enough . Costa \'s secretary whipped out the subpoena for the phone company in a matter of minutes , and I made a dash for the Pac Bell building to deliver it before closing . There were no parking places , but then there are never any parking places in this city . Maybe at 2:00 A.M. , but never when I \'m looking . I left the Volvo in a red zone . A bored woman           sheet . I groveled rather well as I urged her to expedite the request , and stressed how important it was . She did n\'t seem nearly as impressed as I would have liked . Back at the office , Jesse was getting ready to head home . " Can you stay a minute ? " I asked . " I may be digging us into a hole ; you should probably know about it . " p176 I told him about Joe \'s arrest and my meeting with Costa . " We \'ve never worked criminal defense . I realized after I agreed to take the case that I should run it by you . " Jesse looked surprised . He was no more used to being a partner than I was to having one . " Hey , it \'s your call , " he said . " What do you want me to do ? " Unqualified support . That was exactly what I needed just now . " You \'ve just done it , " I said . " Can you stay on top of our           on this one ? " " No problem . I \'ll even take on the Glosser case if you \'d like . " Did I want the albatross off my neck ? You bet . Glosser \'s finances were complex , and I had n\'t had the time to trace them the way I wanted to . I was only too happy to hand the job over to Jesse . I gave him my first full smile of the day . " I \'d love it , as long as you feel okay about doing it . " " Vigilante justice is one of my specialties . What do you have so far ? " " Nothing solid . I \'ve been too busy to do much on it . I \'ve got two companies held as limited partnerships that look interesting . In both cases , the ownership is hidden in a maze of different entities . Then there \'s Sunnyside Properties and a man named Milton Diesman. " p177 If things were dicey at work , they were n\'t any better on the home front . I arrived           was there . Peter had left a message on the machine , saying that he was going out with friends to play music . I usually join them . Tonight I was n\'t invited . Molly had n\'t left any message at all , but there was a message from Gil , the teacher who ran Phoenix , telling us that Molly had missed school , and asking us to call him . " I \'m having a hard time getting through to her , " he said . " Sometimes an idea catches her interest and she really takes off , but a lot of the time she \'s just coasting in neutral . " " Do you think she \'s on something ? " I asked . " No , not at school , anyway . But she \'s talked about some friends of hers who \'re clearly into street life . If she keeps hanging out with them , it could happen . That \'s why I wanted you to know she \'d skipped school . " It \'s real seductive for a kid like Molly .           she enjoys the freedom . Living with a bunch of kids sounds just great . No one to tell you what to do . Every- p178 body sharing drugs and booze . She does n\'t realize what else goes with that . Your friends put you up for a while , but at some point it \'s your turn to contribute something for food and drugs , and what does a fourteen-year-old have to sell except her body ? " I felt sick and sat down on the floor so I could lean against the wall . I \'d known all this , I suppose , but had refused to think about Molly in those terms . " What can I do ? " I asked Gil . " Just what you have been doing . Be there for her . Let her know you care . You ca n\'t live her life , and you ca n\'t lock her in a closet . She \'s a good kid , basically , and smart . She \'ll make it okay . " He offered me a few more platitudes ,           the wall in the dark with thoughts I did n\'t want to have . It was just before midnight when Molly came in the front door and tried to sneak down the hall to her bedroom . I had weeks of AA meetings to thank for the fact that I had n\'t crawled into a gin bottle during the long hours while I waited for her . I had , however , drunk enough coffee and tea to be running on a caffeine high that probably would n\'t wear off for days . " It is n\'t midnight yet , " she said defensively . She reeked of marijuana . " You missed school today , " I said . " Yeah , " she said , trying to sound defiant . " It \'s boring . And the kids are boring . They \'re not much better than the ones in Palo Alto . " " And the streets are fun . " " Yeah . " " Tell me one thing . Where do your friends get their money ? " " What money ? " p179 "           the food , whatever else they need . " " I do n\'t know . They get jobs when they need some money , and Cindy has a boyfriend who helps her out . " " A boyfriend ? Or a pimp ? " Molly looked shocked . " It \'s not like that , " she said indignantly . " Is n\'t it ? Does Cindy do dates ? " Molly looked sullen . " Sometimes , but only when she feels like it . " " Or needs the money . Or the drugs . " " You do n\'t understand , " she shouted . " I understand that life at home can be so tough that even the street seems better . But I do n\'t understand why life here is that bad . " " It \'s not you , " she said . " I mean I really appreciate all you \'re doing . It \'s just that I enjoy hanging out with Cindy and Rae . I \'m not doing drugs or anything . I do n\'t know why you \'re so uptight           failing when I was a kid , and now I was definitely uptight . " I \'m uptight because I love you , and I do n\'t want anything to happen to you , " I said . " The streets are dangerous . " I could have given her the litany of dangers I \'d spent the last three hours reciting to myself -- bad drugs , men who regard an underage girl as a special treat , AIDS , any of the assorted psychos who place no value on human life -- but she was n\'t about to listen to me . She looked at me with the same expression I \'d used on my mother . And I was sorely tempted to adopt my mother \'s reaction to that look , which was to send her to her room . Instead , I said , " Okay , this is how it plays . If you want to stay here , you go to school and you \'re home by six on school nights . That \'s six in the evening , not the morning . Understood           you living with me or with Marion , or are you ready to join your friends on the street ? " I prayed that she \'d give me the right answer . I had no idea what I \'d do if she chose the street , but I knew that it was time for me to set the rules . " Shit , I guess I \'ll stay here , " she grumbled . " Good , and you agree not to cut school or stay out after six ? " " Yeah . Can I go to bed now ? " I \'d have liked a hug , some little sign that the wonderful twelve-year-old who used to inhabit that body was still in there somewhere , but she stalked past me and slammed the door . Peter came in a little later , rosy from too much beer and smelling like cigar smoke . Now that I did n\'t have to worry about Molly , I was furious at her for putting me through such hell . Peter was a convenient target for all that anger . I           delivered his I-just-need-some-space speech , I suggested he could find that at his own place . That \'s exactly what he decided to do . I do n\'t like to sleep alone ; it makes me grumpy . The next morning , I was not in the best of moods to tackle a visit to the Alameda County District Attorney \'s Office and Tom Roselli , but I did n\'t have much choice . Tom greeted me heartily -- a bit too heartily -- called me Katie , which I \'ve always hated , and led me down the hall to his office . He delivered his condolences on my divorce with an attitude more appropriate to a diagnosis of terminal cancer , and launched into an enumeration of my ex-husband \'s virtues . When he paused for breath , I said , " I \'m here about the Reiter homicide . I \'m working for the defense . " p181 He chuckled condescendingly . " What \'s a nice girl like you doing on a case like that ? " I wondered how much you \'d get for slugging           sweetly and said , " Tom , can we cut the crap and get down to work ? " A dark , ugly look crossed Tom \'s face . I was not being a nice girl . He was offended . I did n\'t give a damn . If I was n\'t going to get any advantage from being nice , I was at least going to have the pleasure of not taking any shit from Roselli . " Katie , " he said . " My name is Catherine , " I said . " And you would do well to remember that any obstruction by your office can have an adverse effect on the prosecution . " Roselli was looking downright mean . " And you \'d do well to remember to keep a civil tongue in your head . " We glared at each other , then I switched tactics and smiled . " How is Anne Marie ? " I asked . That caught him off guard . Anne Marie is his daughter , about Molly \'s age . She \'s the apple of her daddy           she was driving him nuts by proving her prowess in judo . Tom ca n\'t talk about Anne Marie without smiling . He mellowed noticeably and said , " She \'s doing fine . Pretty as a picture , boys calling her every night , and straight A \'s in school . " " That \'s terrific , " I said . " And the judo ? " " She \'s a purple belt now , and she was a finalist in the national championships this year . " " You must be very proud . " He nodded . " It does n\'t seem like anything a girl should want to do , but she loves it . And it \'ll keep her safe on the streets . You did some of that , did n\'t you ? " " Aikido . My dad feels about it the same way you do . " It was n\'t true . My dad had applauded my decision to study martial arts , but I was going to get a lot further with Roselli if he p182 thought of me as an           as Dan Walker \'s ex-wife . " So you \'re working on this Reiter thing . A nasty piece of business all around . " I nodded . " I did the investigation that revealed the child abuse , so I know that part of it , " I said . " Not so hard to understand why your client wanted to kill him , " Roselli replied . " I imagine there were quite a lot of people who felt the same way -- former victims , parents of recent victims , brothers , even sisters . " Roselli nodded grimly , his expression indicating that he \'d be leading the lynch mob if his son had been a victim . " True , but Girard is the only one we can place at the scene . " I had him walk me through what they \'d found , and did n\'t learn much that was new . The cause of death was a blow to the head . Murder weapon , a heavy brass paperweight . The paperweight had been wiped clean of fingerprints ; however , Joe           to the judge \'s desk . " Was the front door locked ? " I asked . " No . Closed but unlocked . " " Joe does n\'t know if it was locked when he left . It seems unlikely that the assistant would have left it unlocked . That means someone had to unlock it that evening . " " Could have been Girard as easily as anyone . " " Or it could have been Reiter who unlocked it after Joe left , because he was expecting someone else . " " Who ? " " Someone he called , just as he called Joe . Or someone who \'d already arranged to come by . " " We \'re checking out the phone calls , " Roselli said . " But I think you \'re grasping at straws . " " How about the wife ? " I asked . " In Denver on business . " p183 " The assistant ? " " What about him ? " " Does he have an alibi ? " " He does . Besides , he has no           I gave Roselli my theory that the assistant might be a former victim and possibly a current confederate . I was on the edge again . The look on Roselli \'s face told me that nice women did not discuss such subjects with cool objectivity . " You \'re accusing this man of being a former victim ? " he asked tightly . " I think it \'s worth checking , " I said . Roselli did n\'t say he \'d do it , but I knew he was too good a cop not to . When I left , he shook hands and said , " Good-bye , Catherine . Good luck on your case . " My mother likes to say that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar , and it \'s true , but sometimes it helps to leave the vinegar open , just to make the smell of honey sweeter . p184 I stopped by the jail to see Joe after I left Roselli \'s office . He looked tense and drawn , and he \'d developed a slight nervous tic in his           , but there was a brittleness to his manner . " It \'s a real kick living with a lunatic , " he said . " This guy has the moral awareness of a sea slug , and his hold on reality \'s tenuous at best . " " Is he dangerous ? " I asked . " Hell , he killed two people . Of course he \'s dangerous . " " I \'ll ask Arthur to try to get you a new cellmate . " " Do n\'t bother . This guy \'s probably no worse than lots of the others , and one thing I \'m learning here is that you can always do worse . " It was Tuesday afternoon . I \'d been waiting all week for a second shot at Mitch \'s AA friend , Mel R. With Joe bunking with the 7-Eleven killer , my need to find out more about Mitch had become urgent . Reiter \'s death might not be connected to Mitch \'s , but it was the best lead we had right now , and my p185 stomach was           and the man I hoped could tell me what Mitch was doing just before his death . Mel R. was there , leading the meeting again . I sat with the backbenchers and did n\'t volunteer anything . I spent most of the time looking at the floor , hoping that Mel would take it as a sign of backsliding . If anything would draw him to me , it was his desire to help . After the meeting , he headed for me immediately . " So how \'s it going ? " " One day at a time , " I said , smiling slightly . " I almost blew it last night , but I \'m still here . " " hood , that \'s good , " he said , giving my hand a squeeze . " That \'s how it happens , one day at a time . " " I still think about Mitch all the time . His cousin was arrested for murder . " Mel looked surprised . He clearly had n\'t heard about Joe . " The man who molested Mitch           of days ago , and the police arrested Mitch \'s cousin . But I do n\'t think he did it . See , I think the same guy who killed Mitch killed the judge , and if I knew more about what Mitch was up to , I \'d know who the son of a bitch was . " " You have to let the past go , " Mel said . " Easy for you to say . It was n\'t your friend who got killed . " " But it was . Mitch was a friend of mine , too . " Bingo . My hunch had been right . " And you do n\'t care about who killed him ? " " He \'s dead , Catherine , that \'s all that matters . " The hall had almost emptied . I took Mel \'s arm . " Can we go for coffee somewhere , just talk a little more ? " " Sure , " he said . " Sure , we can . " I hate lying to good people . Scamming sleazeballs and liars           to someone like Mel makes me feel rotten . Not rotten enough to stop , but rotten all the same . p186 We found a coffee shop a block away . It was actually a little hamburger joint , and the counterman did n\'t look at all pleased when we only ordered coffee . He sat the heavy white ceramic mugs down hard enough to make the coffee slosh over onto the table . " You were his sponsor , I \'ll bet , " I said , when the counterman had gone back to his grill . Mel looked surprised . He was n\'t good at disguising his thoughts and feelings . " Let \'s just say I was his friend , like you were . And I have to go on , just as you do . " The problem with pretending you \'re someone you \'re not is that you have to tell the truth at some point or give up the chance to get your informant to make a formal statement . I doubted that I could get Mel to talk to the police , but           admit who I was . " Mel , I need to tell you something , " I said , " but I want you to promise that you wo n\'t walk out on me when I do it . " I \'m sure he thought I was going to confess to falling off the wagon . That would have been a far safer confession than I had to offer . " Will you hear me all the way through ? " " Of course . " " Only part of what I \'ve told you is true . I was n\'t a friend of Mitch \'s . I \'m an investigator working for his cousin Joe . You probably know that Joe refused to help Mitch . When Mitch was killed , he asked me to find the killer and to see that Samuel Reiter was exposed . " Mel \'s face had contracted into anger and suspicion . I continued . " Mitch did n\'t have many friends outside AA . Our only hope of finding someone who knew what he \'d been doing just before his death was           and spied on us , " he said , his voice tight with anger . " I lied . I did n\'t spy . I \'m not about to repeat anything I heard at meetings . But I need to know about Mitch , and you may be the only one alive who can point the way to his killer . " p187 " I told you it \'s over . Mitch is dead . " " But what caused his death is n\'t over . The kids in the book are n\'t dead . They \'re still alive , and I suspect they need help . " Mel frowned . I was sure now that he knew about the photo book . " Did he show you the book ? " I asked . " Some of those kids were n\'t much more than babies . " Mel \'s face clouded . " Leave me alone . I know your kind . You lie and use people . Well , you \'re not getting anything from me . " It was my turn to be angry . " So           and killing a friend than be caught helping a woman who misrepresented herself at an AA meeting . That \'s a real interesting set of values , where lying is worse than abuse and murder . I think you \'re just feeling sorry for yourself and angry that I did n\'t play by the rules . I do n\'t think you give a shit about Mitch or what he was trying to do . " Mel looked like he might hit me , and the narrow booth did n\'t allow much room to maneuver . Then he took a deep breath and closed his eyes . He sat like that -- rigid , eyes closed , taking deep , irregular breaths until his shoulders began to relax and the breathing became regular . Finally , he opened his eyes . " You \'re lucky . You \'d said that to me three years ago , I \'d have taken your head off . " " You would n\'t have reacted so strongly if you did n\'t care about Mitch . So what \'s keeping you from helping me ? "           chewed on it . I forced myself to sit quietly and wait . The decision was his to wrestle with . At last , Mel said , " What , exactly , do you want from me ? " " Just that you tell me all that you know about what Mitch was doing and thinking in the weeks before his death . It may be that something you know could lead to the killer and could help locate the kids in the book . " Mel shook his head . " You know enough about AA to understand that I ca n\'t reveal what Mitch told me. " p188 " That \'d make sense if Mitch were alive , but he \'s not , so who are you protecting , except the man who killed him ? " Mel stared into his coffee cup as if seeking a solution there . " You probably know all about the abuse , " he said slowly . " Well , Mitch took to following the judge -- what was his name ? " " Reiter . " " He figured that           kid to go to the police . He had a camera and he was hoping to get pictures . The second night he followed Reiter , they ended up in Emeryville in an area that \'s mostly warehouses . Reiter met some other guy driving a Mercedes , and the guy got out of his car and went with Reiter . " Mitch lost Reiter \'s car when they got on the freeway , so he went back to the Mercedes . He had boosted some cars as a kid and knew how to get into the Mercedes . That \'s where he found the photo book . " " So the book did n\'t come from Reiter but from one of his friends . " Mel nodded . " Mitch waited . They came back several hours later , and he tailed the guy in the Mercedes to someplace in Oakland . He knew that Reiter \'s buddy must also be a ped , and he figured that maybe he could get them both . He said it \'d be a lot easier to stake out this guy \'s           Piedmont . " I nodded , thinking how obvious a man in an old Ford would have been on the affluent and politely deserted streets of Piedmont .. " And then ? " " That \'s it . That \'s the last I heard from him . I called several times , and he was n\'t there . Recovering alcoholics are n\'t the most reliable people . I figured that he \'d slipped and gone on a drunk . It seems strange now , but I did n\'t even consider that he might have been killed until you came to the meeting . " " Did he have a car license or a name or anything to identify the man in the Mercedes ? " " I think he did , a name maybe , but not a complete one . I p189 remember he said it was like AA , where you get the first name and an initial , and that \'s it . " " Jonah T. ? " " Yeah , I think that \'s it . " " Would you tell the police this ?           . I do n\'t get along with cops . " " How about giving a statement to Joe \'s lawyer ? " " I do n\'t like lawyers , either . I got ta go now . " He slid out of the booth . I caught him before he got to the door . I wanted his name and a way to find him , but I knew he would n\'t give them to me . " I wo n\'t hassle you , " I said . " But if you think of anything more , will you call me ? " I pressed one of my regular cards into his hand . He nodded uncertainly and hurried out the door . I waited a minute , then followed him . There \'s no way you can follow someone who knows you for any distance if they \'re looking for a tail . But Mel was upset , and I hoped he would n\'t be looking too hard or going too far . I crossed the street so I was n\'t directly behind him and stayed a block back           but he did n\'t look across the street . He \'d left his car on a side street a couple of blocks from the meeting . Unless he made a U-turn , he was going to have to drive right by me . I stepped into a doorway and waited . As the car went by , I got the license number . Arthur Costa was not nearly so elated as I about Mel R. \'s revelation . " I \'m not sure how useful he \'d be even if he were willing to testify , but without that , we have nothing . " " Not yet , but I \'m one step closer to finding Jonah T. , and that may put me one step closer to finding out who killed Samuel Reiter . " Perry Mason was probably the only defense attorney to think p190 in terms of finding the guilty party . Costa was clearly far more concerned with building a case that would get Joe off than with finding out who had committed the actual murder . I did n\'t think we had much chance           . I did n\'t expect the Oakland police to be a lot more receptive to my story than Costa had been . A week ago , when Joe was an interested citizen instead of an alleged murderer , they might have taken a different view . Now , Reiter \'s mysterious friend would sound like a convenient ploy on the part of the defense . I pointed out to Warren that I \'d given him the name Jonah T. and the phone number several days before Reiter \'s murder . He thanked me for the information and assured me that he \'d check on the unlisted phone number . His tone was polite and distant , and vaguely patronizing . He reminded me of a doctor who once told me not to worry about the pain in my side . That was a couple of days before my appendix ruptured . As he terminated our conversation he said , " This is a police matter now . I appreciate your help in finding Morrison \'s friends , but I wo n\'t have you interfering with an ongoing investigation . Do           " I said , thinking that if the investigation were a bit more ongoing , I would n\'t need to be involved . Kevin Doyle was n\'t one to wait till I got around to calling . The third time he phoned , Amy begged me to take the call . " I really like Joe , " he said . " I \'d like to help him if there \'s any way I can . This is a big enough story that the papers are going to give it lots of play . Believe me , you \'ll do better with me on your side . " I made the appropriate polite sounds about how much I appreciated his concern and his willingness to help . He interrupted . " I talked to Joe a couple of hours ago .... " " At the jail ? " I asked in surprise . " He agreed to see you ? " p191 " Yes . And he suggested that I call you . " Oh , great , I thought . Joe had been watching too much television if he           way to solve a crime . " He said you thought that the killer might be someone Reiter had molested in the past or the parent of one of the victims . " " Those people certainly have a motive , " I said cautiously . I was uncomfortable discussing the case with Kevin . I did n\'t want to find myself explaining to Arthur Costa how quotes with my name on them found their way into the Chronicle . " Look , I \'d really like to help , " he said . " I guess I feel a little guilty . Maybe if I \'d gone over that night when he called me , he would n\'t have gotten killed . " " Reiter called you that night ? " " Yeah . He \'d seen the story I did on him and he wanted to tell his side of it . I \'d have gone , but I must have eaten something that did n\'t agree with me , and I \'d spent the last couple of hours throwing up , so I was n\'t in much           way I was driving to Piedmont . I told him I \'d see him the next day . " " What time did he call ? " " Jeez , I do n\'t know , I was n\'t in , much shape to worry about the time . Joe said something about phone records . It \'d be there , would n\'t it ? " " Was it before or after eight ? " " I think it was after , but I could n\'t swear to it . It was dark . I know that . Does it matter ? " It mattered a lot . If Reiter called after eight , it proved that he was alive when Joe left . Of course , I still had to prove that Joe had left before Reiter made the call . " Did Reiter sound like he had anyone else there ? " I asked . " No , I did n\'t get that impression . " " Did he seem to have been drinking ? " " I do n\'t know . Maybe . His speech was a little           needed those phone records . I wondered how much longer it would take and made a mental note to call the phone company . In the pause , Kevin shifted gears and asked , " Do you think the judge \'s death is connected to Mitch \'s murder ? And do you know any more about that ? " " I might , " I said . " I \'ll call you back on that . " Kevin did n\'t want to let me go without the full story , but I did n\'t give him any choice . Costa was n\'t thrilled that Joe had talked with Kevin , but he agreed that we were better off with the Chronicle raising questions about Mitch \'s death than with it hammering away at Joe . He was cautiously optimistic about the revelation of Kevin \'s call . " It could be helpful , " he said . " Let me know as soon as you get the phone records . " Kevin was waiting anxiously for my call . He and Costa were at opposite ends of the energy spectrum           felt tired just listening to him ; the lawyer was so low-key I thought he might have gone to sleep while I was talking . I told Kevin that we knew Mitch had been following a man who appeared to be a friend of Samuel Reiter and had come into possession of a photo album containing incriminating evidence . We believed that he was following that same man the night of his death . It was n\'t nearly enough for Kevin . He wanted to know about the album and the man and where Mitch had followed him . I \'ve spent too much time with cops to offer anything more than general information . Give out specifics , and you have a dozen confessions and no way to tell if one of them is genuine . Kevin asked if there was any indication that Reiter \'s friend was a pedophile . I said there was , and that was the last thing he got from me except good-bye . p193 Molly and I spent a tense evening alone . She arrived home at five fifty-nine , but there was           and she gave me the silent treatment during dinner . I had the evening to reflect that I \'d replaced a very desirable lover with a sullen teenager . It did n\'t seem like a smart move . Peter and I are well matched in pride and stubbornness . I was the one who \'d yelled at him ; I \'d have to make the phone call . Crow was never my favorite dish , but I knew it only took a few bites to earn dessert . I was in considerably better spirits the next morning . I \'d have liked to share a leisurely breakfast with Peter , but the memory of Joe in jail drove me to the office early . I called the phone company to see about our subpoena for Reiter \'s phone records and got a perky young woman who really wanted to help but did n\'t know anything about the subpoenas . She informed me that the legal department was reviewing whether or not to honor the subpoenas , and they would contact me as soon as a determination had been made .           a determination has been made . " Bureaucrat-speak is an awesome thing . Waiting around for a determination did n\'t seem like a hot idea , so I decided to get on with interviewing Reiter \'s neighbors and his assistant . I did n\'t expect to find too many of the neighbors home during the day , but on Reiter \'s street , I might find servants and maybe some gossip . On Glen Ellen Drive the houses on the downhill side of the street have striking views of the bay and San Francisco . They date from around the turn of the century and are at least twice as large and lavish as their newer uphill neighbors . Their owners all have servants . The uphill houses have cleaning ladies and an occasional cook . The cleaning ladies spoke a variety of languages , none of them English . They were busy and would n\'t have had time to talk even if they \'d understood what I wanted . The servants were far too well trained to gossip with strangers . Two of them were , however , willing           They did n\'t know a lot about Judge Reiter , but they gave me an earful about his young assistant . Jeffrey Gotelli had made no secret of the fact that he did not consider himself in the same class as the other working people on the block . Reiter \'s former cook had found him so insufferable that she had quit . " I do n\'t think the new missus liked him much , " the cook next door confided . " She asked him to move out of his little cottage in the back after the judge died . Did n\'t have any further need for his services . I guess he was pretty upset about it . " I asked what they thought of the charges that Reiter was a child molester . The cook pursed her lips and shook her head . " I do n\'t know where they got such notions , but you \'ll never convince me . He did have boys around , especially before he remarried , but what \'s wrong with a man giving a hand to boys that need it           know what I mean . " p195 I did n\'t know what she meant . Did she assume that molesters wore dirty raincoats and lurked in alleys ? Or was it that Reiter was too cultured , too rich , too wellborn to indulge in such distasteful activities ? Two houses up the street on the uphill side I found Mrs. BraxtonHancock . She had given the police a long statement and was willing to do the same for me . I \'d read her statement ; there was n\'t much there , since she \'d been out the night of Reiter \'s death , but I hoped to get some background information that the police had been too busy to fish for . Mrs. Braxton-Hancock was in her sixties , a tiny bundle of energy with birdlike motions . She settled me in a chair in her living room , and made a pot of tea . She was fascinated to meet a woman private investigator and wanted to know all about it . In return she was only too happy to tell me about Samuel Reiter . She           home when he was in his early twenties . " It was a real tragedy , his parents dying like that . A boating accident , I think , on the way to Mexico . " The first Mrs. Reiter had been a local girl , someone Reiter had known in high school and later met at some social function . " They seemed the perfect couple , " Mrs. Braxton-Hancock said . " Both so attractive and intelligent . She was a painter , I think . But it did n\'t last very long , five years at the most . She moved away . I do n\'t know where . " " I thought he was a widower , " I said . " Well , I suppose in a manner of speaking . They never really divorced . She was killed in an automobile accident the next year , so he was a widower , I guess . It was a real tragedy for him . He must have pined for her , showed no interest in getting married again until a few years ago , when           point out to my hostess that it was unlikely Reiter had p196 pined for an adult woman when his major interest was young boys . She seemed completely unaware of the charges against him . Like the cook , she probably refused to believe them . " Has he always had an assistant ? " I asked . " Usually . And a cook , I believe . " " And the assistants , have they been young men like the current one ? " She looked at me shrewdly . " Yes . Are you suggesting something ? " " No , not at all . I was just interested in what type of people the judge hired . " They \'ve all been very nice young men . The last one must have been with him five years at least . " " Were any of them married ? " " No , of course not . The cottage is really only big enough for one . " " I know that Judge Reiter was active in many boys \' clubs . Did his assistant participate , too           do n\'t know . I \'ve seen him bring boys to Sam \'s house , and I think he may have gone along on outings with Sam \'s clubs . But that does n\'t mean anything , you know . " We both knew what it meant , but only one of us was willing to admit it . Reiter \'s assistant , Jeff Gotelli , was living in an apartment near Lake Merritt in Oakland . It was a real comedown from the cottage behind the judge \'s house , but it was nice enough to make me wonder where Gotelli got the money to pay for it . His presence there on a weekday afternoon suggested that he was n\'t working a nine-to-five job . Molly would have described Gotelli as " drop-dead gor-geous . " In his mid- to late twenties , he was too old for her , but there are some men you can appreciate at any age . He had p197 the dark good looks of the Mediterranean -- smooth olive skin , curly black hair , and large , deep-brown eyes . Many           eyes . I was surprised that I had n\'t noticed how attractive he was the night I visited Reiter . In the large , dimly lit entry hall , he \'d faded into his surroundings . In his own apartment , he looked considerably more casual and relaxed . There was nothing servile or self-effacing about the way he moved or acted . In fact , it was quite the contrary . If he was the least uncomfortable being questioned by the defense , he certainly did n\'t show it . I had him describe in his own words what had happened the night of Reiter \'s death , and what he \'d seen when he entered the study the next morning . He told me he \'d gone to a party that Sunday night . He \'d left the house right after Joe arrived and picked up his date in another section of Piedmont at eight-twenty . They \'d arrived at the party around eight forty-five . I commented that he seemed unusually certain of the time . " I make it a point to be punc-tual , "           be there at eighttwenty , I am there at eight-twenty . " " How did you meet Judge Reiter ? " I asked . " He was a friend of a friend . " " Can you tell me the friend \'s name ? " " Actually , I ca n\'t . I do n\'t remember it . He was n\'t a close friend , just someone I knew casually . He knew I was looking for a job and that Sam needed an assistant . " " How long ago was that ? " " Five years . " " So you were how old then ? " Gotelli looked surprised , but he answered , " Twenty-two . " " What exactly were your duties ? " " Mainly assisting him with his business affairs . Most people thought I was the butler or something , but I was really an administrative assistant . I did the other things because he needed someone to do them . " p198 " Did you know of Reiter \'s interest in young boys ? " Gotelli flushed . " I do           " It was lies , made up by people who wanted to hurt him . You know when a man is as successful as Sam , when he has talent and he \'s also attractive and wealthy , it makes a lot of people jealous . " At least a dozen people were willing to testify that Jeff Gotelli had been at a party from eight forty-five till after midnight . If Reiter had called Kevin after Joe left , then the assistant had an unshakable alibi . Only the phone records could tell me that . I stopped by the phone company on my way back from Piedmont . Maybe I \'d do better in person than I had on the phone . When it only took three passes around the block before I found a place to park , I figured luck was on my side . Luck was half on my side . The lawyers had decided to release the name that went with the number in Mitch \'s car . It was Edward Kohl . They were still considering our request for Reiter \'s phone records           request for motor vehicle registration information for Edward Kohl . I did n\'t have a birth date or Social Security number and Kohl is not that unusual a name , so I figured I \'d have to wade through a bunch of records before I found the right one . Steve Marley called to ask how things were coming in Joe \'s case . I gave him a quick rundown , and when I got to the name Ed Kohl , he exploded . " Kohl ? Shit ! " " You know the man ? " " Too well . His name \'s come up in several investigations . He \'s a slippery bastard , always at the edge of the picture , but never so we can nail him . That \'s what the Piper is about . Damn it , how could I have missed that ? " p199 " Piper ? " " His nickname is the Piper , as in He who pays the piper calls the tune \' or the Pied Piper . Word has it he can provide anything your average pedophile or           claims to be an investment consultant , specializing in real estate . What that seems to mean is that he owns properties which he rents out at above-market rates in exchange for not asking any questions . " We busted a brothel for underage girls last year . Guess who owned the property . Oh , his name was n\'t on the deed . But he was a major shareholder in the company that owned the company that held the deed . He \'s one slick operator . " " Capable of killing someone who got in his way ? " " I would n\'t rule it out . I think the guy \'s a real psychopath . There \'s nothing inside , no moral sense , no connection to anything but his own drives . See , he \'s not like the peds . They do what they do out of compulsion . He \'s coming from a different place . " " So he \'s not a pedophile ? " " Not necessarily . All that I know about him has to do with kids , but that           kicks . And you can figure he \'s in this for more than kicks . He \'s a high roller . " " And the photo album ? " " It \'s the kind of thing I \'d expect him to have . Those photos were n\'t produced for pornography . Those kids are for sale , and you can bet that a big hunk of their earnings are coming back to the Piper . " My stomach knotted up and I got off the phone as soon as I could . I did n\'t doubt what Marley was telling me , but the ugliness of it was appalling . Part of me wanted to just get off this case , but even the little voice that is usually so sensible said , If decent people are too squeamish to deal with this , who does that leave to protect the children ? p200 Edward Kohl was the break I \'d been hoping for . He was a prime candidate for Mitch Morrison \'s and Samuel Reiter \'s killer . I called Costa in high spirits . Costa reacted to           very interested in Edward Kohl , but he did n\'t want me to take my information to the police -- not yet , anyway . " I want to decide how best to play this card , " he said . " Kohl \'s name does not appear on the police report \'s list of people questioned about Samuel Reiter \'s death . You gave the police the telephone number ? " " A week ago . Of course , I gave it to the officer in charge of the Morrison investigation , but I \'d assume that the Piedmont police have talked with him . " " Yes , certainly , but evidently they have n\'t followed up on the phone number . That could be very embarrassing for the prosecution . " I could imagine his sly smile . " Make an appointment to see Mr. Kohl . Find out what he has to say about Samuel Reiter and Mitch Morrison , but do n\'t ask what he was doing the night either one was killed . I do n\'t want to suggest to him that he needs           which may well be lies , I want your impression of him . What kind of man is he ? How will he come across in court ? " I called Kohl \'s office , but he was gone for the day . I reached him at ten o\'clock the next morning . I \'d anticipated some difficulty in getting him to agree to see me , and I was surprised when he suggested that I come to his office that afternoon . He was so cordial I thought he must have misunderstood the purpose of my visit . I spent the morning wondering why Kohl was so willing to meet with me . It makes me nervous when things that should be difficult are easy . It \'s often a sign that I \'ve missed something I should be paying attention to , and with an adversary like Kohl , any mistake could be dangerous . Kohl \'s office was a block from the place where we \'d found Mitch \'s car and right next door to where I \'d nearly been run down by the kid with the           was parked just up the street . Its vanity license plate read " Jonah T. " That solved the mystery of the name Mitch had written on the paper in his car . He must have assumed , as I would have , that the license bore the name of the owner of the car . I recognized Ed Kohl at once . He was the man Mitch had sketched with Samuel Reiter in his notebook . Mitch had captured him remarkably well . He looked like an aging fraternity boy -- pleasant in a bland sort of way , good features , blond hair , blue eyes , nice straight teeth . It was hard to imagine him as a killer , but I suspect that \'s true of most killers . He made small talk ; I made small talk . We both watched each other . The whole process reminded me of dogs circling and sniffing . Finally , I said , " Did you know Judge Samuel Reiter ? " p202 " Only slightly , " he said . " We met occasionally at social functions           \'s safe anymore . " " So you did n\'t know him personally ? " " No . " " And you did n\'t meet him in Emeryville about a month before his death ? " " No . " He lied well , I had to give him that . " Did you know anything about Judge Reiter \'s interest in young boys ? " " I knew he worked extensively with youth programs . That \'s all anyone really knew . Now that he \'s dead , it seems cruel to speculate on anything more . " Again his execution was flawless . He was the discreet businessman , too well-bred to indulge in unseemly speculation . He would be a difficult witness . I had the feeling that he could be anything he chose to be and that no scruple would intrude to mar his performance . " Do you drive a Mercedes with Jonah T \' on the license ? " " Yes , I do . A silver coupe . What does that have to do with this ? " " Did you lose something           binder ? " " No , I do n\'t think so . " He considered for a moment . " I ca n\'t think of anything that \'s missing . " We looked at each other across his desk . I knew he was lying , and I had the feeling he knew I knew . " Who \'s Jonah T ? " I asked . He laughed . " A friend . I put his name on my license as a joke . " " Did he put Piper \' on his ? " There was a reaction , so slight I \'d never have seen it if I had n\'t been watching , a tightening of the muscles around the eyes . Then he gave me his pleasant , bland smile and asked , " Can I do anything more for you ? " The Oakland Hall of Justice was only a few blocks from Kohl \'s p203 office . I had more than enough to point John Warren at Kohl , but I \'d promised Arthur Costa that I would n\'t do anything until I \'d checked           that Joe might have to stand trial , I \'d let Costa call the shots . The jail was also nearby , and I considered visiting Joe but decided against it . I did n\'t want to raise his hopes until I could nail Kohl for sure . Besides , since I \'d demanded that Molly be home by six , I wanted to be there when she got home . Traffic was impossible on the way home . A truck had spilled some white powder on the Bay Bridge earlier , and the cops had closed the bridge until they knew what it was . By the time I got there , they \'d identified it as harmless and were in the midst of cleaning it up . Those of us who got to sit and wait were not happy campers . In fact , everyone was so frustrated and grumpy by the time they finally reopened the bridge that several drivers promptly plowed into each other and snarled traffic all over again . I got home at six-fifteen , tired , short of temper , and hungry .           of wine and sat down to wait for Molly . Peter got home around seven . Still no Molly . I \'d passed through irritation and was starting to worry . " She \'s probably hanging out with friends and has lost track of time , " Peter said . " The friends are exactly what worries me , " I said . " And an hour is quite a bit of time to lose track of . " We had a quick dinner , and by eight , Peter was as edgy as I was . " I just have a bad feeling about this , " I said . " She knows she \'s supposed to be home by six . Do you think she \'s run away ? " " Did you check her room ? " " Nothing \'s missing except what she took to school . I have a rough idea where the vampire twins hang out . I \'m going to check on them . " " Why do n\'t you let me do it , " Peter suggested . " You should p204           may be less hostile to me . If I do n\'t get anything from them , I can start checking with some kids I know and some other sources . " Peter had a lot more sources on the street than I did . It made sense for him to go , but I hated like the devil to be stuck waiting by the phone . It did n\'t help any that I \'d spent my afternoon with Ed Kohl . Kohl was an unnerving reminder that the dangers I \'d warned Molly about were all too real . The hands of my watch slowed down as the hour got later . I wanted Molly home , but I still did n\'t know what to say to her . I knew we could n\'t go on like this . The phone rang at nine-thirty . " Is this Catherine Sayler ? " The voice was female and young , but it was n\'t Molly \'s . " Yes . " " This is Rae . I was at your house . " " Yes ? " I said , my           to call you , but she \'s , like , sick , and I think you should come and get her . " " Where are you ? I \'ll be right there . " " She said to make you promise that you would n\'t call the police . She did some drugs , and she \'s scared you \'ll turn her in . " " I wo n\'t call the police , and I wo n\'t turn her in , " I promised . " Just tell me where she is . " " We \'re down near Fifth Street on Bluxome . The number is two twenty-three . It \'s like this old warehouse , and you ca n\'t get in the front door , but there \'s an alley on the side , and about halfway down , there \'s this blue door . You can come in there . We \'re on the second floor . " " I \'ll be right down , " I said , and there was a click at the other end . p205 I hurried down to my car           Molly for putting herself and me through all this . As I drove down Divisadero , I wondered exactly what drugs Molly had been " doing , " and how sick she was . I prayed it was n\'t an overdose or a batch of bad stuff . At Turk , I almost missed the red light and had to brake to a stop just shy of the intersection . All I needed now was a ticket or a wreck . I resolved to be more careful . But as I turned onto Golden Gate my foot seemed to have a will of its own , and the needle on the speedometer climbed more quickly than it should have . I had to brake again at Van Ess . The red light glared down at me , stubbornly exercising its power . I realized that my breath was coming in short , shallow gasps , and made a conscious effort to take deeper , longer breaths . Usually , that calms me ; today , it simply made me more impatient . Just as I decided that the light must           Civic Center and through the Tenderloin took forever , but once I hit Sixth Street , the traffic thinned , and p206 I could make decent time . at night , so I cut over to Howard . I hoped to hell that Bluxome Street was where I thought it was . I found it on the first try , and drove up the street until I found the number , then around the corner and up the alley to the blue door . The alley looked deserted . Years ago its proximity to the train yards would have made it attractive to hobos , but today \'s homeless were n\'t railroaders , and they stayed closer to downtown . I wondered how the devil Molly and her friends had found this place . I parked just before the blue door , pulled the flashlight from the compartment on the car door , and got out . The blue door bore a faded pink notice that informed me in large letters that the building was unsafe for human occupancy . Beneath the notice , the door stood slightly ajar ,           the city \'s warning . The door was braced with heavy crossbeams , a clear sign of earthquake damage . This area was full of brick buildings built on fill , which is about the worst combination in a quake . During the quake , a couple of them had lost their outside walls , and many more had been damaged . Some , like this one , still awaited repair or the wrecker \'s ball . I pushed the door open , wedged it to keep it that way , and stepped inside . The building was a warehouse , and I was standing in a wide hall . To my left , heavy beams cross-braced an opening the size of a garage door . My flashlight illuminated only a tight circle of space . Beyond its beam was black emptiness . " Molly ? " I called . A muffled moan answered me from somewhere ahead . I followed the sound . Yellow light leaked from under a door at the top of a flight of wooden stairs . I picked my way through the rubble and climbed           A single p207 low-watt bulb illuminated a small room . Against the opposite wall , a shapeless heap of blankets lay on an old mattress . I hurried toward them , praying I was n\'t too late . I pulled back the blanket to find a pile of rags and felt suddenly sick as I realized that I \'d been set up . " Hands on your head , please . " The voice was almost casual , as if the order were just a polite request , but I recognized it at once and knew that Ed Kohl was deadly serious . I did as I was told and turned slowly to face him . He stood next to a pile of boxes where he must have been hiding . He wore the same bland smile he \'d greeted me with at his office , but he was holding a gun . " Sal , " he called . The door behind me opened , and I turned to see the young man with the strawberry birthmark pushing Molly ahead of him into the room . Her hands were           been forced into her mouth as a gag . Her eyes were wide with fear . After all my worries about Molly running away , I \'d discovered that there were far worse possibilities . Kohl made a motion with his free hand , and Sal moved Molly over next to me and pushed her down onto the mattress . He handed Sal the gun , with orders to shoot me if either of us moved , then moved around behind me . " Put your arms behind you very slowly , " he said . He slid my jacket off and checked the pockets . The turtleneck and jeans I was wearing were too tight to hide a weapon , but that did n\'t stop him from searching for one . When he \'d finished , he stepped back and took the gun from Sal . " Why ? " I asked , though I knew the answer . " Because you would n\'t back off , " he said . " A man in my position ca n\'t afford to have someone like you digging around . You           but God knows what else you might have come up with . I ca n\'t take that chance . " p208 " But you did kill Mitch Morrison . " " Sure . For the same reason I have to kill you . I \'m a businessman . You are a liability , so was he . " " And the judge , was he a liability , too ? " " To himself , not to me . There \'s no way Sam would have even admitted to knowing me , much less revealed that he knew what I did . No , he was n\'t a threat to me . " " Then why kill him ? " " You \'re asking the wrong man . I did n\'t kill Sam . I did n\'t need to . " Kohl was perfectly capable of lying , but there was n\'t any reason for him to . He \'d already admitted to one murder , why deny the other ? " Where \'s the book ? " he asked . " The police have it . They found the           The one Morrison stole from my office . " I did n\'t say , " What other book ? " but my face must have revealed what I was thinking , because Kohl said , " So you have n\'t found it yet . Too bad . I \'d like to have it back . " " What are you going to do with us ? " I asked . " Dump us behind another bar ? " " No need . This neighborhood will do fine . Your niece ran away , you got into the wrong part of town looking for her . " " You better make it good , " I said , " because my ex-husband is an inspector in homicide , and no matter who does the investigation , it \'s bound to be a personal friend . " " There wo n\'t be anything for them to find , just as there was n\'t in Oakland . People die all the time in a neighborhood like this . " " Not people investigating murders . Not former wives of homicide detectives . This           not to look like a setup . You get Dan Walker on your trail , you \'re going to wish it was only me you were dealing with . " P209 Kohl smiled broadly . " I \'m terrified , " he said . " You surprise me . I would n\'t have taken you for a gambler . " He was smiling , but he was also thinking , and that gave me some reason for hope . If he decided to shoot us here , it was probably all over , but if he had to take us somewhere else , there was a possibility that he \'d make a mistake and I \'d get a chance at him . " Okay , " he said . " No problem . I \'ve got just the place for you . We do n\'t have to worry about the kid , see . You \'ll be glad to hear that she \'s not part of this . A cute little piece like that -- what is she , twelve , thirteen ? There are folks \'ll pay plenty for           I \'d have killed him right then . In cold blood . I \'ve learned to control fear , but the fury that surged through me pushed me right to the edge . Kohl laughed , a nasty , evil sound . " Sal \'ll take care of her . But do n\'t worry , he \'ll be real careful with her . Go on , " he ordered the other man . " You know where to take her . I \'ll be there soon as I finish here . " Sal started toward us , and I waited for the moment when he \'d come between Kohl and me . With my training in aikido , I had no doubt I could take them both , but not with a gun pointed at me . I needed Sal for a shield . Just as he was about to step between us , Kohl barked out , " Do n\'t walk in front of her , dummy , go around behind . " With him coming in behind me , and my hands on my head , there was           shot . I forced myself to stand still while Sal pulled Molly up from the mattress and dragged her toward the door . For the first time , I felt truly helpless . There was n\'t a damn thing I could do to stop Sal , and even if I did save myself , I was n\'t sure I could save Molly . When they were gone , Kohl said , " We \'re going to take a p210 little walk down the street , down to those buildings at the end . You \'re about to become another victim of the quake . " He laughed harshly . I remembered those buildings . The entire outside walls were gone , but the interior ones remained . Metal scaffolding held the floors up . A deep trench surrounded the foundations . Kohl was right . No one would question an accident there . Kohl picked up an electric lantern with his free hand and motioned me toward the door . With only a beam of light coming from behind me , I could barely see the stairs . It would           my hands , but negotiating those stairs with my hands on my head was nearly impossible . Just over halfway down , I missed a step and plunged forward in the darkness . I grabbed for something to break my fall and caught hold of one of the poles supporting the handrail . Momentum threw me forward , and a wrenching pain shot through my shoulder . I let go and rolled down a couple more steps , landing hard on the floor at the bottom . Another sharp pain shot through my shoulder and the side of my face slammed against the floor . A moment later the beam of the flashlight bored into my eyes . " Get up , " Kohl said . I did n\'t know if I could . I was still in shock , and I could n\'t tell how much damage the fall had done , but as my head cleared , I made a decision . " I do n\'t know if I can walk . " I said . " I think I did something to my leg . " "           through the motions , struggling to get on my hands and knees . My left shoulder hurt like hell , and a knife of pain stabbed through my right ankle . As I started to stand I let myself fall again . " I ca n\'t , " I said . " I think I broke it . " Kohl hesitated . He descended the stairs and stepped behind me . I could n\'t see a thing except the blinding light he kept in my eyes . " Get up now , " he ordered . " I ca n\'t . " I tried to sound desperate . p211 " Get up or I \'ll shoot you here . " I \'d hoped he \'d reach down to pull me up , but he was too smart for that . " Please do n\'t shoot , " I pleaded . " I \'m getting up . " I struggled and stumbled to my feet . I did n\'t have to fake the limp . I just accentuated what my body already wanted to do , but as I approached the           so that my left foot was always forward . " Keep moving , " Kohl ordered . I shuffled even slower . " Damn it , move , " he snarled . He stepped in closer and jabbed me in the back with the barrel of the gun . It was the moment I \'d been hoping for . I pivoted to my right and spun around , knocking his gun hand to the side . My right hand slid down to grab his wrist . I stepped behind him , brought my left hand around his neck and across his throat , grabbed the collar of his leather jacket and pulled hard . He struggled against the choke . I \'d missed the carotid artery . The pain in my shoulder was almost more than I could stand . I was n\'t going to get a second chance . I stepped back and went down on my left knee , bringing Kohl down hard . I slammed his right arm , fully extended , across my right leg . There was a pop as the elbow broke . Kohl           p212 Pain stabbed through my shoulder and ankle , and I did n\'t know how long I \'d have the strength to keep the pressure on Kohl \'s throat . I gritted my teeth and held tight as he struggled against my arm . " Where \'s my niece ? " I demanded . " You want your niece ; I want my freedom . We can do busi-ness , " he croaked . I gave the arm with the broken elbow a sharp yank . He screamed . " Where is my niece ? " I repeated . He made a gurgling sound , and I loosened my arm a bit . Too much pressure and I \'d choke him out . He would n\'t be much use to me unconscious . " Tell me , " I said , " or I \'ll twist your arm off . " I gave another yank to make my point . " All right , all right , " he cried . " I \'ll take you there . " " You \'ll tell me where she is first , then           I tightened my grip on his arm . He gave me an address on Del Norte Street . " Tell me about it . " " What do you mean ? " " What kind of place is it , who \'s there , what can I expect ? I do n\'t want any unpleasant surprises . " p213 " It \'s a house in the Castro , sort of a halfway house where kids hang out . Runaways . Boys . " " And where will your friend have taken Molly ? " " I \'ve got an office in the back , on the second floor . " My arm would n\'t hold out much longer . I shifted my grip and increased the pressure on his carotid artery until he sagged into unconsciousness . Then I gave him a push forward onto the floor and felt around for the gun near my right foot . I \'d only have a few seconds before he regained consciousness . Even though I did n\'t think he was in any shape to give me problems , I wanted the gun           dropped the lantern when I turned on him . Fortunately , it had n\'t broken . It lay on the floor in front of us , illuminating empty space while we remained in the dark . I picked it up and shined it in Kohl \'s face . His skin was a ghostly white , whether from the light or the pain , I could n\'t tell . His eyes fluttered open and stared blankly at me . I shivered , aware for the first time that my back was wet with sweat . " Up , " I said . As Kohl \'s head cleared , his nasty disposition returned . He swore colorfully if not imaginatively . " Get up , we \'re going to get my niece , " I said . " Fuck you , " he said . " I \'m not going anywhere . " " You \'re going . With or without a couple of bullet holes in you . Your choice . " He paused and blinked into the light , as if he were trying to see my face to gauge           I said . " You do n\'t have to go there , " he said . " You could call and Sal would meet you somewhere , exchange me for Molly . That \'s the safest bet . " I wanted safe , but I was n\'t about to let Kohl define it for me . " We \'re going to my car now , " I said . " Give me any excuse at all , and I \'ll shoot you . That \'s a promise . " He limped ahead of me out the door . At the car I made him p214 stop and keep his good hand over his head while I opened the trunk . " The trunk ? " he shouted . " You ca n\'t put me in the trunk . I \'ll suffocate . " " I do n\'t think so , " I said . " I do n\'t like vermin in my car . Get in the trunk . " " What about my arm ? " " It too . Move . " Kohl climbed awkwardly into the trunk           . The drive to Del Norte Street was one of the longest of my life . All I could think of was how terrified Molly must be and what appalling danger she faced . Kohl \'s instructions to Sal gave me some reason to believe that she was safe for the time being , but things can go wrong . Sal could panic or she could try to escape . I tried to force my mind away from such thoughts , but fear sat heavy in my chest , compressing my lungs so it was hard to get enough breath . There was n\'t a lot of traffic , but every slow driver in the city seemed to be on the streets tonight and all the lights were red . I slammed on the brakes to avoid an ancient Volkswagen that pulled out right in front of me . A muffled yelp from behind reminded me that it was a rough ride in the trunk . I did n\'t give a damn . Kohl would n\'t suffocate , because Volvos have an opening from the trunk to the main compartment           was n\'t a priority . I forced myself to think about how I \'d deal with Sal and the others at the house on Del Norte Street . It was risky to go in alone , without backup . If something went wrong , Molly would still be in Sal \'s hands with no one to come after her . But it was even riskier to call the police . Their involvement could easily lead to a hostage situation with lots of men with guns and far too much chance that a shot might go astray . p215 I decided to call Peter . If he was home , I \'d use him for backup . If not , I could leave a message telling him where I \'d gone and why . I found the address on Del Norte . It was a two-story row house , third from the corner on a residential street a block above the commercial district . I drove past it twice to be sure I knew the layout , then looked for a parking place some distance away . I found one three           a small neighborhood grocery . I needed a phone . The man behind the counter was Asian , probably Korean , an older man with tired eyes . He was obviously getting ready to close . " You all right , miss ? " he asked . " Your head is bleeding . " I touched my cheek and discovered that I \'d cut it in the fall . I considered cleaning up but did n\'t want to take the time . Besides , this way I could claim to have had some kind of accident that required Sal \'s help . " I fell , " I told the grocer . " Do you have a telephone I could use ? " " There \'s a pay phone over by the chips , " he said . I reached in my pocket and realized I \'d left my wallet at home when I rushed out to get Molly . The old man handed me a quarter with a look that said he had n\'t really expected me to have the money . I called home , hoping to catch           message telling him what had happened and where we were . I ended with , " If you do n\'t hear from me by eleven , call the police . Do n\'t try to go in before then . " I limped the three blocks to the address Kohl had given me , feeling every step in my aching ankle . My stomach had tied itself into one large , painful knot ; and my chest was so tight that breathing took an effort . I shivered , but the icy chill in my hands and feet had nothing to do with the cold night air . I paused in front of the house , then climbed the steps to the p216 porch and knocked on the door . The hand in my right pocket held Kohl \'s gun . A boy in his early teens , in tight jeans and a white T-shirt , answered the door . " I need to see Sal , " I said . He looked at me for a moment , then said , " I think he \'s upstairs . " "           kid stepped aside and let me enter . He did n\'t seem to care much about who I was or why I was there , and my disheveled appearance had n\'t bothered him any . I did n\'t have to ask directions because there was a set of stairs in the entrance hall . I climbed to the second story and walked toward the back . If Kohl had n\'t lied to me , the door at the end of the hall should be his office . I stood with my back to a wall and knocked . Sal opened the door . Before he could move , I said , " I have Kohl \'s gun in my pocket . Just walk backwards into that room . " He did . I followed him in and closed the door behind me . Molly sat on an old couch , still bound and gagged . " Put your hands on your head , " I ordered Sal . His eyes were wide enough so you could see the white all the way around . He put his hands on his           " he protested . " I ai n\'t touched her . " " It \'s a damned good thing for you , " I said . I made sure he did n\'t have a gun , then made him lie facedown on the floor while I removed the tape that held the gag in Molly \'s mouth . " Oh , Catherine , " she gasped . I reminded myself we were n\'t out of this yet and kept my tone as cool as I could manage . " We \'re going to be fine , Molly , but you have to keep it together till we \'re out of here . Can you do that ? " She nodded and bit her lip . " Good . We \'re going to walk right out of here . Sal , you \'re going to walk ahead of me ; Molly , you walk behind me . Be p217 careful not to get between Sal and the gun . " I untied her wrists and ankles . " Can you walk all right ? " " Yes , " she said           and hold her to me , to smooth her hair and comfort her , but this was not the time for that . I ordered Sal to get up , cross his arms in front of him , and hold his elbows as we walked out . " Be real careful not to say or do anything that might make me feel I have to shoot you , " I said . He did n\'t look so dangerous anymore . We must have made a strange procession , but no one stopped us as we left the house . We walked the three blocks to the car , and when we reached the corner and I could see it ahead with the trunk still closed , I began to breathe easier . At the car , I had Sal put his hands behind his back ; then I handed Molly the gun , and used my belt to tie Sal \'s wrists . It \'s a lot harder than you \'d think to tie someone up with a belt , and it took several tries . I was glad I           I put Sal in the backseat of the car , with another warning on the dire consequences of trying to get loose , then I gave Molly the big hug that we both needed . She clung to me but she did n\'t cry . " Are you all right ? " I asked . " Can you go with me to the police ? " She nodded . " Yes , " she said in the same small voice . I wanted to take her anywhere but a police station . She needed someplace warm and comforting where a kind , loving person would serve her tea and cookies and hold her while she cried . She needed home , but that was a long way away right now . The Hall of Justice is nearly deserted at eleven o\'clock at night , but there are always people at Southern Station , just inside the p218 front door . I pulled into the red zone at the curb and walked up the front steps with my gun in my pocket , my hands in full view , and Sal           the door , a cop sat behind a metal detector . Even in the daytime , this building felt cold and cavernous . At night , it was even less hospitable . Dirty yellow light spilled through the slab of bulletproof glass that separated the police station from the lobby , accentuating the gloomy darkness of the outer room . I stopped in front of the metal detector . " This man kidnapped my niece , " I said . " There \'s a man in the trunk of my car who tried to kill me . I have his gun in the pocket of my jacket . " At the mention of the gun , the patrolman jumped up . He looked like he was about fifteen . He stammered for a minute and then picked up the phone and called for reinforcements . Two men in uniform hurried out of Southern Station . The older of the two was a stocky man in his early forties . He was about my height and close to twice my weight . His name tag identified him as Emile Alvarez .           gun from my pocket . Everyone breathed easier when that was taken care of . " There \'s a fair chance that that \'s the murder weapon from an Oakland homicide about four weeks ago , " I said . " The man in my trunk confessed to being the killer , though I \'m sure he \'ll deny it to you . " Alvarez escorted us into Southern Station and sent two cops to retrieve Kohl . " May I see your identification , please ? " he asked . " I do n\'t have it with me , " I said . I was in the process of explaining who I was and why I had an injured man in my trunk when they brought Kohl in . He was pale , and his arm hung useless at his side , but it did n\'t slow him down any . " That woman tried to kill me ! " he shouted . " She held a gun p219 on me and locked me in her trunk . I need a doctor , and I want my lawyer .           ordered the patrolmen to take him to the Emergency Room at SF General . " These men will take your statement at the hospital , " he said . Kohl was still protesting and threatening lawsuits as they took him out the door . " He \'s a dangerous man , " I warned Alvarez . " They know he \'s a homicide suspect . They \'ll be careful , " he assured me . He turned to Molly . " Do you need to see a doctor ? " he asked gently . Molly shook her head . " How about you ? " he asked me . I shook my head . " I \'d just like to get this over with so I can get my niece home . " He had me tell him my version of the evening \'s events , then he said , " The inspector will want to talk with you . " I put my arm around Molly and drew her to me . " Hang in there , " I said . " It \'s going to be all right           held her there . p120 We sat on hard chairs and waited for the inspector . The light seemed too bright , and the noise made my head ache . I asked to use the phone and called home . Peter was still out , so I left a message telling him that all was well and we were at Southern Station . I was almost dozing when I remembered something Kohl had said back at the warehouse , something I did n\'t want to forget . I \'d been so concerned with saving Molly that I \'d shoved it to the back of my mind . Now I tried to pull it up . It was a reference to a book , but not the book of photographs , another book , one Mitch had stolen from Kohl \'s office . I was too tired to think as clearly as I needed to , but I sensed that book was important and I wondered why it had n\'t been in Mitch \'s apartment or his car . He must have hidden it somewhere or given it to someone .           finding . It could be connected to Mitch \'s murder , and even to the judge \'s . So long as Joe was still in jail , we needed to know everything we could about Samuel Reiter. p221 My thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of an attractive Asian woman in her thirties , with short black hair . She introduced herself as Inspector Lui and took us upstairs to her office . There she had Molly recount the night \'s events . I learned that Kohl had enlisted a friend of the vampire twins , a boy in his late teens , to lure Molly to the warehouse . He \'d offered her a ride home and claimed he needed to drop something off on the way . The " something " turned out to be Molly . I also learned that Molly recognized Kohl as the man who had spoken to her in front of my apartment and given her a ride to Polk Street several days ago . I wondered how he \'d known where to find me ; then I remembered the business card I \'d           to see how close I \'d get . My call , or maybe my visit , had set him off . Molly described her whole ordeal with amazing composure . She was close to tears several times , but she fought them down and went on . When she apologized to me for the second time , I realized that she felt responsible for what had happened . " I should have listened to you , " she repeated . I pulled her to me and held her . " This did n\'t happen because of you , " I told her . " Those men were after me . They just used you . " Later , I \'d have time to reflect that the hardest part for both of us was feeling responsible for the other \'s pain . Lui had Molly go back over several points . I began to relax a bit , and a wave of exhaustion and nausea hit me . The whole left side of my head throbbed . I reached up and touched it gently . The hair on that side was           it when I fell . My cheek and the inside of my mouth also hurt , my right ankle ached , and I could n\'t lift my left arm without a sharp stab of pain . But I would heal . It was Molly I was worried about . When Lui finished with her , I asked if I could call Marion to take her home . Molly objected so strenuously that I agreed to let her stay with me , at least for the night . p222 As we were getting started on my statement , an older man in a brown suit came in and whispered something to Lui . I recognized him a few seconds before he recognized me , so I was ready when he said , " Say , are n\'t you . . . ? " " Catherine Sayler , " I said . " Hi , Bill . " Bill Stanton was one of the first police officers I \'d met when I came to San Francisco . He reached out and shook my hand with the same slightly awkward gentility that I           the name , but I never forget a face . You \'re Dan Walker \'s wife . " " Ex-wife , " I said . " We were divorced several years ago . " " Oh . " He looked genuinely distressed . " I \'m sorry to hear that . " Before I could tell him that he \'d do us both a favor if he did n\'t mention my presence at Southern Station to Dan , he said , " There \'s a Peter Harman out front asking after you . I \'ll let him know you \'ll be down in a while . " I thanked Bill , and we returned to my statement . Lui had me take her through the whole evening , including breaking Kohl \'s elbow . " You must be very good to have disarmed a man of his size , " she said . " I had a lot of motivation . " I did n\'t tell her about yanking on Kohl \'s arm or that I \'d have shot him if he \'d given me any excuse at all .           or the things I \'d been willing to do . It was beginning to look as if we \'d be spending the entire night at Southern Station , so I asked Lui if she could n\'t expedite things and let us come back down and sign the statements in the morning . I doubt she \'d have done it for me , but she could see that Molly was exhausted , so she cut some corners for us . Peter and Dan were waiting in the lobby , and both of them looked considerably the worse for wear . It \'s a real ordeal for p223 those two to be in the same room together . They both work so hard at being polite that you think their faces are going to crack . " You guys look like you \'re waiting at the morgue instead of Southern Station , " I said . They both jumped up , then there was an awkward moment while they waited to figure out what to do next . I went to Peter and gave him a big hug , then turned and           We both needed all the hugs we could get . When I pulled away from Dan , he studied my face . " You have a nasty scrape on your cheek and the cut on your head might need stitches , " he said . The thought of going to a hospital tonight was more than I could manage . All I wanted was to get Molly home and to crawl into bed myself . The head wound was n\'t bleeding anymore . It could wait till tomorrow . " I just want to go home , " I told him . " Can you drive my car and leave yours here ? " I asked Peter . " I do n\'t feel like driving . " By the time we got home , Molly could barely keep her eyes open . I tucked her into bed and stayed with her until she went to sleep . I was exhausted , but sleep was a long way off . As I sat down in the living room I began to shake uncontrollably . Peter wrapped a blanket around me and           of things , " I said through clenched teeth . My head throbbed , my stomach was queasy , and my heart pounded . I had held myself together through the scene at the police station and until Molly was safely tucked away , but my body was n\'t holding on any longer . Peter poured me some brandy and steadied my arm while I drank it . I was afraid my stomach would n\'t take it , but it actually helped . " Want me to build a fire ? " he asked . p224 I nodded , anxious to surround myself with every possible source of comfort . When he had a fire going , he wrapped me in his arms again and held me against his chest . " Want to talk about it ? " he asked . I told him the whole story . It did n\'t get any better for the telling . " The worst part , " I said , " was knowing what could happen to Molly . I could n\'t stand to think about what Kohl might do to her           would have been uncomfortable under other circumstances . I put my head against his chest and struggled to calm the maelstrom of emotion that seethed inside me . Fear and anger were no strangers , but I \'d never felt either the way I had tonight . I could have killed Kohl in cold blood and without regret . But that was n\'t what bothered me . It was the intensity of my fear that haunted me . Nothing had ever frightened me like the possibility of Molly coming to harm . I \'d spent years developing the self-defense skills that allowed me to feel safe even in dangerous places , and in one night I \'d discovered an appalling vulnerability . Part of me wanted to ship Molly back to Marion immediately , but that was the same part that wanted to bolt whenever Peter got too close . I try not to listen to it . Peter \'s heart beat steadily and reassuringly as I lay against his chest . I gave him a hug . " And you ended up sitting on a bench with Dan Walker           bad . Walker has mellowed some . He did n\'t even beat me up for leaving you alone to nearly get killed . " I pulled away and looked at Peter . The lines on his face seemed to have deepened , and he looked exhausted , not just physically tired but emotionally drained . " Does n\'t look like he had to . I have the feeling you did the job for him . " Peter managed a rueful smile . " I keep kicking myself for not seeing that it was a setup . " " Right , you should have seen it , even though I did n\'t . Is p225 that \' cause you \'re a man or just because you \'re supposed to be smarter than I am ? " " Oh God . " Peter moaned . " Now you \'re going to beat on me. " p226 The next morning complaints from various parts of my body indicated that I \'d done more damage than I \'d realized on my trip down the stairs . A number of ugly bruises had blossomed during           dark blue camellia . My head throbbed dully , and the scalp wound had opened again while I slept , leaving the pillow looking like something for the police lab . The blood disturbed Molly , who \'d ended up in our bed when the nightmares struck . It was reassuring to have her body cuddled tight against me , but it also made sleeping difficult , and I crawled out of bed at seven feeling exhausted and miserable . My first effort to move my arm told me that a visit to the doctor was definitely in order . But the worst thing I had to face was n\'t the physical pain . It was the knowledge that I had to call Marion , and I had to do it soon before she heard about the evening \'s escapades somewhere else . The call lived up to my worst fears . When you have to start out by reassuring a mother that her child is alive and uninjured , you \'re in trouble . Marion \'s voice rose to a shrill screech , and the pain in my head           p227 story she heard . She vacillated between concern for Molly and fury at me . " I \'ll be up to get her immediately , " she informed me . " I think it \'d be better if I brought her down , " I said . " I do n\'t think you want to run into a bunch of reporters , and that \'ll be a real possibility here . " As I \'d expected , Marion was n\'t anxious to meet the media . She accepted my offer with a comment about Leonard having a reputation to uphold in the community . It struck me that Leonard \'s reputation was a heavy burden to lay on Molly \'s back . Peter watched me stumble around the kitchen , favoring my right leg and trying not to move my left arm . " I think you \'ll need me to drive you and Molly to Palo Alto , " he said . " Palo Alto ? " Molly howled . " I do n\'t want to go home . Please , last night you said I could stay           you can , " I said . " But that \'s Marion \'s decision . I do n\'t have any legal right to keep you here unless she agrees to it . " " I wo n\'t go back , " she said stubbornly . " She ca n\'t make me . " She \'s worried about you , " I said . " And given what happened last night , she has good reason to think that I \'m not a good person for you to live with . " Molly fussed and moaned while we ate breakfast . I called Jesse and gave him the short version of the night \'s adventures . He had more questions than the police , but he did n\'t get much satisfaction since I needed to cut the conversation short so I could call my doctor . I reached her as soon as the office opened and managed to talk her into working me in first thing . The phone rang again almost as soon as I \'d hung up . It was Arthur Costa . " I hear you had a           How ? " " Your reporter , Kevin Doyle , called . He \'s most anxious to reach you . " Of course he was . He and a couple of dozen other reporters , probably . I \'d better get away before they found me . I gave Costa an abbreviated description of the night \'s misadventures . " Do you think Ed Kohl killed Samuel Reiter ? " he asked . " I do n\'t know , " I said . " He did n\'t confess to it , but he \'s a great candidate if he ca n\'t come up with an alibi . " " The police will no doubt question him today . We should know soon whether they have enough to charge him . In the meantime , you can expect to be popular with the press . Be careful what you say . " Costa gave me a telephone number for Doyle . " Make sure he knows how this ties in with the Reiter case , " he said . I put off calling Doyle until I got to the doctor \'s           anyway , and I did n\'t want to be home when the members of the fourth estate found my address . Doyle had gotten the story from the police reporter , and he was most anxious for the details , but his first question was , " Are you and your niece all right ? " I was beginning to understand why Joe liked him so much . I told him some of what had happened , then said , " Look , Molly and I really do n\'t want a lot of publicity . Is there any way we can keep a fairly low profile on this ? " " It \'s going to be hard , " Doyle said , " but maybe I can help . The story can be played several ways . Obviously , everyone \'s going to love the **54;27;TOOLONG angle , but I think I can persuade my editor that the real story should focus on Kohl as sex merchant to the rich and powerful . I know that will appeal to him , and in that version , you slip from paragraph           drop a few comments around my colleagues . If I play it right , they \'ll all believe they figured it out for themselves . But you have to promise to give me the whole story , especially anything that ties into the Reiter case . " " Absolutely , " I said . " I \'ll call as soon as I get back from Palo Alto . " I turned to find my doctor watching from her office door . Her forehead was creased with a frown . " I \'m sorry to keep you waiting , " I said . " I did n\'t mean for that conversation to take so long . " " If you \'re going to go one-on-one with killers and kidnappers , you \'ll need more than a GP , " she said . " Come on in , and let \'s see how much damage you \'ve done to yourself . " Mary has a sharp tongue but a gentle touch . I stay with her because she takes me seriously . If I say there \'s a problem , she keeps           have to look too hard . The problem with my shoulder was a bad sprain , which was a whole lot less serious than some of the other possibilities . She put me in a sling and gave me an ice pack for it . " I do n\'t suppose you take painkillers , " she said . " I \'m careless , not a masochist , " I said . " Of course I take painkillers . " She gave me a couple of prescriptions , one to reduce the inflammation , the other for the pain , and ordered me to get them filled in the pharmacy downstairs . " Now , " she said as I walked out the door , " not when it \'s convenient , but now . " She need n\'t have worried . I was anxious to do anything that would delay my meeting with Marion . Both the pharmacist and the officers at Southern Station were unusually efficient . I got my pills and signed last night \'s statement in less than an hour . The traffic to Palo Alto was           in front of Marion \'s . The p230 Cape Cod house with its immaculate yard had the " right " address in the " right " town . It was equipped with all the " right " things . No wonder Molly did n\'t feel that she fit . I suggested that Peter stay in the car . My sister does not bring out the best in me , and I did n\'t want an audience for our encounter . " I \'d feel like I was driving the getaway car , " he complained . " Besides , you could use some moral support . " He climbed out of the car and followed me in . I had n\'t gone into a lot of detail with Marion , so she was n\'t prepared to see me looking like I \'d lost a fight with the Hell \'s Angels . " Catherine , " she gasped when she opened the door . " You did n\'t tell me you were hurt . " Then she glimpsed Molly behind me , and I stepped aside so she could give her           warm hug , and Marion had tears running down her cheeks when Molly finally pulled away . Leonard was waiting in the living room . He \'s stiff and a bit standoffish under the best of circumstances , and today he was almost frozen . Even before we sat down , Molly said , " I do n\'t want to come home . I want to stay with Catherine . " Marion \'s face clouded . " Now , listen here ... " I put up my hand and said , " Whoa , back up . I know you two love each other , but you sure keep it a well-hidden secret . " They both stared at me . " We scared your mother badly , " I said to Molly . " She acts angry , but she \'s really scared because she ca n\'t stand to think of what could have happened to you . Tell her , Marion . " Marion stuttered . She did n\'t seem to know what to say . " Of course I love you , and I was worried sick           should have started to work . They should have given each other a big hug , resolved their differences , and lived happily ever after . They did n\'t . Marion said some of the right things , and Molly started to p231 relax and look like she was n\'t under attack , then Marion took a dig at me , and I could n\'t resist responding in kind . I showed all the restraint of a ten-year-old , and the fourteen-year-old sprang to my defense . Before long , she and Marion were screaming at each other again . Even with a hefty dose of painkiller coursing through my veins , I could n\'t take the noise . I sank down on the couch , and Peter , sensing the need for reinforcements , stepped forward and took Molly by the shoulders . It was an act of reckless courage , like breaking up a cat fight . He could easily have been slashed by both of them . " Your mother and Catherine need to talk , " he said . " Let \'s go for a walk           her gently toward the door . " Let \'s go for a walk , " he repeated in a tone usually reserved for much bigger , tougher people . With Molly gone , Marion collapsed into a chair . She did n\'t look a lot better than I felt . Leonard kept standing there looking uncomfortable and trying to figure out how to take charge . He started to say something , and Marion interrupted . " Leonard , honey , " she said with the same phony sweetness she used to use on our parents , " could you give Catherine and me a few moments to talk ? " Leonard was delighted . He fled to the back of the house . Then to my surprise , Marion began to cry . She does n\'t do that often , so I was n\'t sure how to respond . " I do n\'t know , " she said , blowing her nose . " I \'ve done everything I could with Molly , and she seems to hate me . We were so close when she was younger ,           same room with me . I \'ve been scared to death she \'d do something foolish and get herself hurt . I just do n\'t know what to do with her . " " She \'s working on a hefty case of teenage rebellion , " I said , reflecting that my mother could testify to my expertise in that area . " And she feels like she does n\'t fit in here . " p232 " She does n\'t try to fit in , " Marion complained . " In fact , just the opposite -- she dresses wrong , hangs out with the wrong kids . She makes a point of not fitting in . " It always amazes me that some people , my sister included , see right and wrong as social rather than ethical concepts , but Marion and I had had that argument before . " I think she may fit in better in the city , " I said . " She seems to get along all right with the kids at school , and after last night , I think the streets           stay with me . " Marion considered it and , to my surprise , agreed without an argument . " Do you think she \'d spend the weekend here ? " she asked almost timidly . " Leonard could bring her back up Sunday night . " Molly had cooled down when Peter brought her back , and seemed pleased both by the agreement that she could continue to live with me and by her mother \'s invitation to spend the weekend . As we were preparing to leave I asked Marion the question I did n\'t want an answer to . " Did you call Mother about this ? " She shook her head vehemently . " No . I do n\'t run to Mother with every problem , you know . " It was the first time I could remember her missing a chance to snitch on me . Maybe there was hope for my baby sister after all . p133 I returned to my office with some trepidation and was grateful to see no sign of TV crews as I drove up the street . But my           saw the expression on Jesse \'s face that we had a more serious problem than the media . " Joe \'s been attacked , " he said . " Call Arthur Costa . " " What happened ? " " His cellmate went after him . Arthur says the cops claim he was n\'t hurt , but it does n\'t sound good . " I got through to Costa right away . He \'d been in Oakland to see Joe . " It \'s not as bad as I \'d feared , " he reported . " Joe \'s not seriously hurt , and he \'s in a cell by himself now , but it could have been very bad indeed . " He explained that Joe \'s cellmate , the 7-Eleven killer , had taken offense at something Joe had said or done , and slammed him against the wall a couple of times . " This is exactly the kind of thing we were afraid of , " he said . " I do n\'t know if it was random chance that Joe drew a raging lunatic for           , but if the guard on duty had n\'t been paying attention , Joe could be dead now . " p234 I told myself that Costa was exaggerating the danger , but the tightness in my chest and heaviness in my stomach were truer indicators of what I really believed . It \'s too damned easy to die in jail . Costa continued , " The jails are crowded . I do n\'t know how long they \'ll keep Joe separated . I certainly hope they find evidence linking Kohl to Reiter \'s murder . " I hoped so , too . But I knew we \'d better not count on it . I needed to find Kohl \'s missing book , but as soon as I was off the phone , Amy brought me a stack of messages from more reporters than I \'d have thought we had in this town . I \'d have dumped them all in the trash , but I was n\'t about to give up any opportunities to suggest a connection between Kohl and Reiter \'s death . I called Kevin Doyle first .           your voracious colleagues are calling on the phone instead of staking out my office , " I said . " I think I can safely accept credit for directing their attention elsewhere , " he said . " I \'ll be right over so you can tell me the whole thing in person . I can also help you figure out which of those calls you need to return . " " Give me thirty minutes , " I said . " I \'ve got to take care of something else first . " If Mitch had stolen Kohl \'s book , I had a good idea where I might find it . The problem would be getting my hands on it . I called Steve Marley . My activities of the night before would probably provide his division with enough material for several months . He was ebullient when he came on the phone . " We busted the house where you found Molly , " he said . " Kohl kept an office there , and we seized boxes of papers . We \'ve got enough to put           murder charge . " I told Marley about the other book . He gave a low whistle . p235 " It fits , " he said . " We have n\'t found much dealing with money or his personal finances , and the stuff we have uses codes instead of real names . A man in Kohl \'s business has plenty of dirt on his customers . I ca n\'t believe that he did n\'t keep more than we \'ve found . That book could make very interesting reading . " I wanted to help Marley , but I was far more interested in getting Joe out of jail . Right now the book looked like my best chance of doing that . " I might be able to get it for you , but I need some help . I need to borrow your most lurid example of the kind of photograph we found at Mitch \'s apartment . Something really shocking that would get to a former victim . " " I have some pictures from previous cases . I suppose I could lend you one . You           " " I need to get someone \'s attention . " In California , an investigator can no longer get the address of a citizen from the Department of Motor Vehicles . It used to be that all you needed was a license number , and for a small fee , you could get information on the owner of the plates , but after one careless PI delivered the address of an actress to a deranged fan who subsequently killed her , the DMV has made that information off-limits . Off-limits to investigators . Not off-limits to those working for insurance companies . I have a cozy relationship with a firm that occasionally needs my services for corporate fraud cases . They were only too happy to get me Mel R. \'s real name and address . Mel was n\'t happy to see me when I showed up at the door of his basement apartment that evening . It took him a minute to figure out who I was , and my battered appearance probably slowed down his door-slamming reflexes . I got my foot in the door and stuck           of his face . p236 " Just a reminder of what we \'re talking about here , " I said . " Have you really shut down so tight that you ca n\'t feel anything for those kids ? " " What do you know about it ? " he exploded . " And who the hell are you to talk to me about abuse ? " " I \'m the one who damn near got killed last night because the man Mitch stole that book from was looking for it . " He looked at me with dawning comprehension . " Come on inside , " he said . He watched me warily as I stepped into the room . It was scrupulously neat and rather Spartan , as if physical comfort and worldly goods were not of great concern to its occupant . In the corner a portable television set was tuned to the evening news and male and female pretty faces chatted with studied animation . Mel walked over and hit a switch and the screen went blank . " You were the one involved in that           , and the man who tried to kill my niece and me is the one who killed Mitch . " " I did n\'t know his name , " Mel said . " I did n\'t make any connection to Mitch . " " The police think he was a big-time operator . I think his records are in the book Mitch stole , the one he gave to you . " Mel did n\'t try to feign ignorance . " How did you know ? " he asked . " Because you were the only one he \'d have given it to . The only one he trusted enough . He knew that you \'d been a victim , just as he had . I \'d guess that \'s why he chose you for his sponsor ; he thought you \'d succeeded in putting it behind you . " Mel nodded . " But I was n\'t the right one for him . He really needed someone to help him get vengeance , and I was never into that . I believe that you have to find forgiveness in           " " Is that why you did n\'t give me the book ? " p237 " I do n\'t know . I did n\'t see that it would do any good , and it might have done harm . I guess it did harm , anyway . I \'m sorry . " " I do n\'t know what that book contains , but I think Kohl killed Mitch to keep whatever \'s in it secret . If you hide the book , Kohl succeeds . And the people involved in this " ? I held out the photograph again ? " are safe to continue what they \'re doing . I ca n\'t believe you want that . " Mel shook his head . " No , you \'re right . There \'s a difference between forgiveness and irresponsibility . I \'ll get it for you . " He went into the next room and returned after a minute with an old , black loose-leaf binder filled to overflowing with papers . " This is what Mitch gave me . He was afraid it might be stolen from his place           seeming conscious of the move , wiped his hands on his pants . Kohl \'s missing book did more to take my mind off the pain in my shoulder than Mary \'s little pills . I brought it home to Peter like a new toy , and we laid it out on the kitchen table and began going through it . Even a brief inspection told us that it would take days to decipher . Jesse was only too happy to come over when he heard what we had . We spent the entire evening trying to make sense of Kohl \'s nearly illegible handwriting . It was enough to convince me that penmanship should be a required subject in all schools . Jesse went home around eleven , taking a section of the book with him . I did n\'t expect him to get much done over the weekend since he \'d informed me his lady love was returning from a business trip on Saturday . On the other hand , with Molly out of the apartment , it was possible that Peter and I would be less productive           moved from the kitchen p238 table to the living room when Jesse left . Peter put the Dead on the stereo , and we snuggled on the couch ; at least we came as close to snuggling as my arm would allow . " So what did the doc say about your arm ? " Peter asked . " It \'s a bad sprain . She advised against rolling down stairs and suggested that I avoid people like Kohl in the future . " " Good advice . How careful do you have to be with it ? " " You mean , do we have to give up our favorite activity ? " " That was a general question , but if you choose to interpret it as a sexual solicitation , far be it from me to correct you . " " It seems the sort of question that would require empirical examination , " I said . " I just love it when you get empirical , " Peter said with a grin . During the weeks of Molly \'s visit , sex had taken on a           teenager in my parents \' house . There was a delicious freedom in knowing we had the whole house to ourselves , though making love with a sprained shoulder requires a certain amount of careful choreography . I was stiff and sore Saturday morning , and if anything I looked worse than I had the day before . The discomfort just fed my desire to unlock the secrets in Kohl \'s book . One section appeared to be written in some kind of code , and we decided to start there . The first column contained entries of two , and in a few cases three , capital letters . One set was SR . I hoped that stood for Samuel Reiter . Following each set of letters were other notations , often with dates . It might as well have been written in Arabic . Kevin Doyle called at two o\'clock to tell us that the Oakland police had charged Ed Kohl with the murder of Mitch Morrison , but not with that of Samuel Reiter . It seems that the night of Reiter \'s death Kohl had been           been seen by any number of upstanding citizens . The news was a sharp disappointment . Though I \'d been fairly sure that Kohl had n\'t killed Reiter when he denied it to me at the warehouse , I \'d hoped that the police would charge him with it . I \'d have been only too happy to let Kohl take Joe \'s place in jail . With Kohl eliminated as a suspect , we were worse off than we \'d been before the warehouse confrontation . Joe was still the prime suspect , and we had nothing to point the police in a different direction . Joe could n\'t command a private cell for long in the crowded jail , and his next cellmate might be even more dangerous and violent than the previous one . Kohl \'s book looked increasingly like our only hope , so Peter and I spent a frustrating weekend trying to make sense from its entries . On Sunday we took it to the copy shop and copied the entire thing ; then I played the good citizen and delivered it to the police           Kohl arrest was still page-one news . The San Francisco Police had found information among Kohl \'s papers that led them to a brothel that specialized in underage girls . The story got bigger headlines than the national news . Page three carried Kevin Doyle \'s interview of the madam , and it was one of the more troubling pieces I \'d read in a while . The woman pointed out she had n\'t stolen the girls from a convent . " Everyone is so offended by the idea of these girls selling sex , but no one gives a damn when they \'re starving on the street or being raped in a back alley . If the churchmen and the politicians care so much for these girls , where \'s the money to take care of them ? " It \'s damned uncomfortable to find yourself agreeing with a woman who prostitutes young girls . I called Kevin and complimented him on the story . " It \'s terrific . Pulitzer material , " I said . " The worst part is that she \'s right , " Kevin           There is n\'t one major social program that serves kids that has n\'t been cut during the last ten years . It \'s easier to get money for prisons than for schools . " I \'d never heard him so bitter . In fact , I was always amazed at how upbeat he could be while covering such painful subjects . " Sounds like this story is getting to you , " I said . " Oops , you caught me on my soapbox , " he said . " I \'ll climb down if you \'ll have lunch with me . " I agreed and he asked , " What \'s happening in the Reiter case ? Any other leads at all ? " " Maybe . Take me to lunch , and I \'ll tell you a story . " P241 The mail arrived around eleven and Amy handed me an envelope with no return address . " Looks like it might be personal , " she said . A single sheet of white typing paper fell out when I slit open the envelope . On a manual           " If you care about your niece \'s health , stay away from Samuel Reiter \'s death . " I stared at the note , and Amy stared at me . " Leave everything on my desk just the way it is . Do n\'t touch a thing , " I said . " I \'m going to Molly \'s school to pick her up , then we \'ll call the police . " All the way to Molly \'s school I told myself that she was n\'t in danger yet . My mysterious correspondent wanted to scare me off , not to hurt Molly . Surely they \'d wait to see the effect of the warning before taking further action . Emotions set little store by logic , and the rest of my body paid little attention to my head . My heart speeded up , my mouth went dry , and I felt exactly as I had on the drive to the warehouse . Phoenix School had its temporary headquarters in the basement of a church about twelve blocks away . I left the car by a hydrant           hurried down the hall I could hear Molly \'s voice from a room up ahead . There was no fear in it , but it had a serious , thoughtful quality that I had n\'t heard a lot lately . " Well , I do n\'t think the Trojan p242 War was Helen \'s fault . She was just an excuse . These guys did n\'t give a shit about women . They slaughtered them and traded them around like baseball cards . You ca n\'t tell me the war had anything to do with love . " A thin boy with a reedy voice began to object , but I did n\'t hear his argument . I leaned against the wall and took several deep breaths before I entered the room . I \'d forgotten that I still looked like recent road kill , but the kids \' surprised expressions reminded me immediately . " I need to take Molly out of school early , " I told Gil . Molly looked confused , but she gathered her things . One of the girls reached out to give her           " she asked as we headed for the car . I told her about the note . " Wow , " she said . " You mean that there \'s someone else , someone besides those guys at the warehouse ? " " I \'m afraid so , " I said . I took Molly back to my office and called the police . Then I called Peter . Both got there about the same time . The police took the note as seriously as I had . They bagged it for the lab and questioned both Molly and me about any strangers we \'d seen around the apartment or her school . Neither of us had seen anything . " I \'d like to be able to assign an officer to watch her , " the investigator said , " but we \'re shorthanded , and I ca n\'t do that . " I \'m not overly impressed by the deterrent power of one bored police officer following you around , perhaps because I can think of several ways I \'d get past that officer . " I \'ll           " I do n\'t want this guy to have any idea where she might be . " " Not home , " Molly wailed . p243 " Definitely not home , " I said . " It would n\'t take much to find you there . " " Your parents ? " Peter suggested . " No , that \'s still too easy . Would you take her to the cabin ? " Peter owns a cabin in the Santa Cruz mountains . No one would connect it with me , and it is n\'t a place you \'re likely to meet someone accidentally . " That \'d be neat , " Molly said . " I love the cabin . " The cabin is a lot less " neat " in the cold and wet of April than in the warmth of summer , but I did n\'t tell her that . Peter frowned . " It \'s a good place for Molly , but I \'d rather be closer to home . You could use someone to watch your back . " " It \'s not my back           , Peter , sending her with you is the only way I \'ll feel she \'s safe . " It took more grumbling on Peter \'s part and the promise that I \'d use Jesse for backup and not go off on my own , but in the end he agreed to take Molly to the cabin . The police officer issued the required warnings about keeping doors locked and calling if I saw or heard anything suspicious , then departed . Once he was gone , Peter said , " I can take off work for two or three days , maybe four , if you \'ll do some work at the courthouse for me . That \'ll give you time to figure out where to send Molly till this is over . This could go on for months , you know . " I knew that . I did n\'t think I could stand months of worrying every minute about whether a killer might be after Molly , and I sure as hell was n\'t going to let Joe down . I had to find a way to           I \'d completely forgotten that I \'d arranged to have lunch with Kevin . He arrived at my office just as I was saying good-bye to Peter and Molly . I wanted to wrap the two of them in my arms and hang on for dear life , but I forced myself to let go p244 after a quick hug . I bit back the temptation to issue lists of instructions and warnings and tried to keep our parting light . Peter made no such attempt . " For godssake , be careful , " he said as he left . Kevin and I had lunch at a little place just off Fillmore that has great homemade soup , and while we ate I told him about the note and Kohl \'s book . " Have you any idea at all who sent the note ? " he asked . " None . It makes me think that I must be closer to the killer than I realize . There must be some evidence out there that the killer thinks I have or he \'s afraid I \'ll find ,           . " " But what ? " " I wish I knew . I suspect it has something to do with Kohl \'s book . I spent a good part of the weekend going over it , and I kept a copy I made after I turned the original over to the police . I have n\'t found a list of names , but he was clearly keeping some sort of accounts . Marley \'s pretty sure he \'ll have a list of clients somewhere . I \'m hoping it \'ll lead us to a good suspect . " " Another pedophile , like Reiter , " Kevin suggested . " I \'ve heard something -- unfortunately , I ca n\'t reveal the source ? from a guy who knew both Kohl and Reiter . He says that Reiter was n\'t the only one in the criminal justice system who was into kids . Reiter had a friend -- he thinks it was someone important ? who also liked boys . " " Did he tell you anything about this friend ? " Kevin shook his head . " No           friends . " I thought of Reiter \'s diaries . K. was the only adult friend that Reiter had mentioned , and I assumed K. stood for Kohl . But other friends might have appeared in other diaries . " I wish I \'d read all the way through Reiter \'s diaries , " I said . " Reiter kept diaries ? " " Yes , Art Costa should be able to inspect them . They were p245 hidden on Reiter \'s boat . Marley took me with him once when he went through that stuff . " " Wow , what else did they find ? " Kevin \'s avid enthusiasm reminded me that he was still a reporter and always on the lookout for a good story . " Down , boy , " I said . " Sorry , " he said . " I could n\'t help thinking what a great story the diaries might make . What else did they find ? " " The only other thing I saw was a bunch of photos of the kids Reiter had molested . " I told           freckle-faced kids trying to pretend that nothing unusual was going on . " They all looked so young and vulnera-ble , " I said . " It was a vivid reminder of how many kids he abused . " Kevin nodded soberly . " After Kohl \'s trial , I \'d like to try to see those diaries . It \'s a story that needs to be told , you know . " " I know , but right now I \'m more interested in Joe \'s story . Will you see if you can get anything more out of your source ? " " Of course , and I \'d also like to help you run down stuff from the book . I \'m not worth much as a bodyguard , but the killer \'s less likely to try something when there are two of us . Besides , you look like you could use some help with driving for a couple of days . " I did n\'t feel that I needed a bodyguard , but the idea of having a driver appealed to me . My arm           my ankle to step on the brake , and driving to Molly \'s school and back had taken its toll . I accepted Kevin \'s proposal with enthusiasm . " One of the things we \'ve gleaned from Kohl \'s book is a list of properties , " I said . " How about taking a look at the actual buildings that go with the addresses ? " The first was a two-story building just off Clement . Four buzzers beside the front door indicated that it was divided into flats . The only one that answered was for the downstairs apart- p246 ment on the right . Its occupant was a woman in her midthirties who was working at home but agreed to talk to us for a few minutes . She knew nothing about her landlord except that she mailed checks to Pacific Coast Properties in Oakland . She gave us the address . It was Kohl \'s . The other tenants were all young professionals , and it did n\'t seem like we had anything , until she complained about George Gillespie \'s nephews . Gillespie lived           , but she always knew when he had his nephews over because they made so much noise . The boys were about eight or nine , and sometimes they brought friends . They visited several times a week . Under any other conditions , we \'d have taken the story at face value , but given the landlord , you had to wonder about those nephews , especially when it came out she never saw Gillespie in the morning . " It sounds almost like he does n\'t really live here , " I said , " like he just visits in the afternoon . " " At the rent they charge on this place ? Why would anyone do that ? " she asked . I did n\'t think she \'d really want to know . " Nice setup , " Kevin said as we got back in the car . " A guy wants a pad where he can entertain boys , but he does n\'t want to put it in his own name . Kohl provides it , no doubt at something above market rents . The           rent , and everybody \'s happy . " " The SFPD should be very interested in these addresses , " I said , " and maybe somewhere in the list of guys they pick up , we \'ll find one who knew Samuel Reiter . " " Let \'s check out the whole list , " Kevin suggested . " You never know what else we might find . " His blue eyes sparkled with excitement , and his fingers drummed on the steering wheel . p247 " You really love this kind of work , do n\'t you ? " He smiled , a wide , toothy , boyish grin . " I live for it , " he said . " The most fun I ever had was working stories on the IRA . It was like being in the middle of a spy movie . In the end , it turned out to be more talk than action , but there was one guy who really was hooked in to the IRA , and had been collecting money and acting as a courier for them for several           man here , and we had to smuggle him out of the country . It was great fun . Robbie Quinn was his name . The U.S. wanted to extradite him , but the Irish authorities never could seem to find him . " Kevin gave me a wink and laughed . As we headed back downtown , he said , " There \'re a lot of Irish out on the Avenues now , but in the old days we all lived south of the slot . You know what that means ? " " No , " I said . " South of the cable car slot , meaning south of Market . Before the twenties the Irish could n\'t live north of the slot . That \'s why the Mission and the Castro had big Irish populations . They were south of the slot . " San Francisco was a big Irish city . Most of the men ended up as cops and in other middle-level jobs . The best never made it to the work force . Soon as the Jesuits spotted them , they were headed           Franciscans to be turned into good citizens . That \'s why there were so few great Irish leaders here . The bright ones ended up as priests . " It took only a little prompting to get Kevin spinning tales of the Irish in San Francisco . He was a natural storyteller with a healthy shot of stand-up comic and a mockingbird \'s ability to mimic voices . People I \'d known only as names in the newspaper came alive as he described their quirks and foibles and imitated their speech . The afternoon went swiftly in his company , and I was grateful to him for making an unpleasant job enjoyable . We checked p248 out addresses all over the city , total score : two more apartments that may have been rented to pedophiles and a house that neighbors described as being like the local boys \' club . The other places seemed to be legitimate real estate holdings ; no sinister purpose we could discern . Maybe the police would have more luck . p249 Kevin and Jesse and I spent a lot of time together over           Kohl \'s book . When you \'re trying to catch a thief , it helps to think like one , and we quickly discovered that Kevin had a certain native talent for that sort of thing . " You have a truly devious mind , " Jesse said in response to one of Kevin \'s more creative suggestions . It was a high compliment . I kept a close watch for anyone suspicious in my neighborhood , but either he was very good or he was n\'t sticking close . Kevin loved being a bodyguard . If I had n\'t grown so fond of him , I would n\'t have put up with his chivalric nonsense . Peter agreed to stay an extra day with Molly if we did some research for him at the courthouse . There were a number of things we needed to check in connection with Ed Kohl , so Jesse volunteered to take care of both assignments . It was a real concession for him to go to the courthouse since he was a firm believer that anything worth knowing was available on computer .           bugging him for a week to go to the courthouse to check on Anton Glosser. p250 Kevin and I spent the day puzzling over the book without noticeable success . Jesse called at four and I could tell he was excited . He did n\'t want to blow his image as cool , so he restrained himself from whooping , and said simply , " I \'ve got something very interesting for you . Be over after I check a couple more things . Oh , you probably want to send Kevin home before I get there . " An hour and a half later , when he finally arrived , I was just past dying of curiosity and headed for deeply annoyed . " So ? " I said . " What did you get ? " " Well , first I learned that technology does indeed have its limits . You were right about the value of going to the courthouse to check documents . " I love to be right , especially in an argument with Jesse , but tonight I just wanted to know what he           if you do n\'t get to the point , " I said . " Okay , here \'s what I did n\'t get from the computer files . Ed Kohl \'s lawyer is Milton Diesman . The same Milton Diesman whose name popped up in your investigation of Anton Glosser . Diesman \'s name is all over Kohl \'s investments , but only on a couple of Glosser \'s . Care to guess which ones ? " " The two we \'ve had such trouble tracking and , of course , the one with Diesman as a general partner . " " You got it , but it gets better . " Jesse could n\'t hide his glee . " The house where they took Molly was owned by West Coast Properties , which is owned by a limited partnership with Ed Kohl as the general partner . And guess who is one of the limited partners in this little company . " " Not Anton Glosser . " " The very same . " I let out a low whistle . What a stroke of luck ! We \'d           the Kohl connection we would n\'t have known what it meant . I wondered about the connection between Kohl and Glosser . It could be Diesman . The lawyer probably helped Kohl find p251 investors for his ventures , and Glosser would have been a natural choice . But it could be a far darker connection . Anton Glosser could be a pedophile . I went back to the book , to the coded section we thought held the names of Kohl \'s clients . There was no A.G. listed . We checked the full list of people who were members of Kohl \'s various limited partnerships . About a third of them matched sets of initials in the book . " We need more information , " I said . " We wo n\'t get anything from Diesman . Did you get names of notaries ? " Jesse consulted his notes . " Yep , and we \'re in luck . The papers for West Coast Properties and most of the others were notarized by a Jules Valdo . He probably works for Diesman . " " He \'s           . " " And then ? " " Glosser is either a pedophile , in which case I \'ll happily help Steve Marley build a case to send him to jail , or he \'s simply an investor who did n\'t ask too many questions about why he was making such a good return on his money . In that case , I imagine that he \'s very nervous about the possibility that word will get out of his connection to the house on Del Norte Street . " " As well he might be , " Jesse said . The news about Glosser was exciting , but it did n\'t get me any closer to Reiter \'s killer and the man or men who threatened Molly . If the book had n\'t yielded an answer in two days , it could be weeks before we broke its codes . Weeks of worrying about Molly and rearranging both Peter \'s and my lives , weeks of feeling like a sitting duck . I was n\'t about to put up with that . I needed a way to provoke the killer           to know he was headed my way than to have to wonder where he was . The first step was to get Molly safely out of the picture . p252 Sending her to any of my relatives meant fessing up to my parents about a number of things . Marion did n\'t want to explain why Molly was living with me , and I did n\'t want to explain how I \'d almost gotten us both killed . It was a story better told in the past tense , when it was really over and they did n\'t have to worry about how it was going to end . It was time to call in a favor , and the person who came to mind was Corinne Case , a longtime friend and former employee who now lived and worked in Boise . " Casey " had teenagers of her own , so she was familiar with their rituals and strange behavior . From stories she \'d told me on the phone , Molly would fit right in with her brood . Casey was delighted to help . She \'d           I told her I needed a babysitter more than a backup person and promised to give her a call the next time something exciting came up . She described the cases she was working ; they sounded wonderfully dull . Peter liked the plan a lot less than Casey did . He whined and fussed and complained about me acting as bait for a killer . He made the whole thing sound a lot more dramatic and dangerous than it really was . Finally , I told him just to put Molly on the plane to Boise , in either Oakland or San Jose , and we could fight about it when he got home . I spent the evening planning my strategy . If I was going to be the bait , I was sure as hell going to call the shots . That meant setting the whole thing up before I let either Jesse or Peter get involved . The next morning I called Kevin Doyle before I left for work . I knew that Kevin loved a good scam and wanted to help Joe . That made           what I wanted to do . " What I need is something that will make the killer think I \'m about to deliver incriminating evidence to the police , " I told him . p253 " A newspaper story , " Kevin said . " That could be very useful . " " A newspaper story in which sources close to the defense complain that the police are not pursuing the case vigorously enough and indicate that an unnamed private investigator has evidence implicating a secret associate of the judge \'s . How \'s that sound ? " " Terrific . I do n\'t want this to drag on . Can you suggest that this evidence will be delivered to the police in the next three days ? " " Sure , whatever you want . Pardon me for asking , but is n\'t this a bit dangerous ? " " It could be , but I do n\'t think the killer is a pro , and I \'ll have Peter and Jesse watching my back . " " It \'s your show , " he said . " I           that Joe \'s attorney will back you up . And you can expect th ? cops to be on your case . " The killer , I thought , will be the least of my worries . Costa did n\'t like the plan . It was risky . It could cause trouble with the police . It was n\'t the way things were done . I pointed out that standard procedure had gotten us nowhere and was likely to continue taking us there . This was by far the most promising approach we had . Finally , Costa agreed that he \'d go along with the plan for four days . He did n\'t say what he \'d do at the end of that time , but I had the feeling the killer \'d better be in custody or he \'d hand me my head . Next , I called the law offices of Milton Diesman and asked for Jules Valdo . A secretary with a voice that could cut glass informed me Mr. Valdo no longer worked there . She did not know where I could find Mr. Valdo           is not a common name . There was only one Jules Valdo in the phone book . He was n\'t at home but his wife was , and she was happy to give me his office number . p254 Valdo worked as a paralegal for a firm I \'d once dealt with on a case . It was a definite step up from Diesman on the respectability scale . I offered to buy him lunch . He accepted . Jules Valdo was a smallish man with a pinched mouth and a crease between his brows . He looked like he could do the " before " segment of an Excedrin commercial . His voice had n\'t prepared me for his pinched appearance . It was rich and mellifluous , the kind that ought to go with a cleft chin and lazy smile . " You wanted to see me about Mr. Diesman ? " he said as soon as I \'d introduced myself . No social pleasantries , no meandering around to get to the point . " Yes , " I said . " I understand you used to           yes , " he said warily . The tone was so odd , so guarded . I felt like the grand inquisitor or maybe a representative of the IRS . " Why did you leave Mr. Diesman ? " I asked . " I was not altogether comfortable with some of his prac-tices , " Valdo said . I did n\'t hop up and do a little dance around the table , but that \'s sure what my spirits were doing . An unhappy employee is almost as good as an ex-wife when you want to know the dirt . And it turned out that Mr. Valdo did know plenty of dirt . He \'d watched Diesman and Kohl put together a number of deals . " I did n\'t know exactly what was going on until I read those articles about Ed Kohl , " he said . " But I could tell just from the way they talked and the way that things were structured that these were not legitimate businesses . And I do n\'t mean that they were highly speculative . That \'s just it ;           estate , good solid properties that should have been a straightforward investment . Yet they were looking for investors who wanted a fat return and would n\'t p255 ask too many questions . That \'s what I heard Kohl say more than once , no questions asked . \' " I told Valdo about West Coast Properties and the house on Del Norte Street . He shook his head in disgust . " It does n\'t surprise me , " he said . " Not really . I knew there was something going on . " " Do you remember a man named Anton Glosser ? " I asked . " He was one of the limited partners on that deal . " Valdo shook his head . " Glosser is a large man , maybe six two and big boned , not really fat , just large . He has blue eyes and thinning blond hair , which he combs over a bald spot where his hair \'s receded . His voice is a bit loud and harsh . " Valdo shook his head again . " I do           they did n\'t know what they were getting into . They were anxious to make a killing , and you do n\'t come to Milton Diesman if you \'re too concerned about ethical investing , but they did n\'t know the details . " I probed and questioned , but Valdo did not remember Glosser . He did n\'t know whether Diesman or Kohl had brought him in on the deal , and that was all-important . Finally , Valdo said , " Wait a minute . I did n\'t meet him , but there was a man who was head of a computer firm , or maybe it was electron-ics -- I think it was electronics -- who invested in a number of Diesman \'s schemes . That could be your Mr. Glosser . " Several hours at the courthouse confirmed that Anton Glosser had invested in a number of deals where Diesman was the registered agent . I felt fairly sure by now that Glosser was simply greedy rather than predatory . I headed back to the office to see Jesse . He and Peter were waiting in           Jesse was irritated that I had n\'t told him of my plan , and both he and Peter had a dozen reasons why it was a bad idea . I \n p150 Edie -- perhaps late at night , in the dark -- and leaving her , dead and blood-stained , on the kitchen floor . He shivered at the thought . Vi noticed the shiver . " Is something worrying you ? A ghost just went over your grave . " This observation was too close for comfort . " I was thinking about Edie \'s cousin . I do n\'t like her . " " Oh , Henry . " " I do n\'t think Edie is safe with her . " Vi made a little face . " To be honest , Henry , I \'m not very happy either . But I think that it \'s just a great trial for Edie . We talk about her cousin in the mornings , over coffee . Lottie \'s certainly a very tiresome lady , but apart from driving Edie to distraction with her ways , I do n\'t think Edie \'s in any real danger . Not the kind you \'re imagining . " He had n\'t told her what he imagined , but she knew . Vi always knew things like that . " You will           ? You wo n\'t let anything happen ? " " No , of course I wo n\'t . And I shall make a point of seeing Edie every day , and keeping an eye on the situation . And I \'ll ask Lottie for tea one day , and that \'ll give Edie a bit of a breather . " " When do you think Lottie will go away ? " " I do n\'t know . When she \'s better . These things take time ? \' " Edie was so happy , on her own . And now she \'s not happy a bit . And she has to sleep on the Put-U-Up . It must be horrid not being in her own room . " " Edie is a very kind person . More kind than most of us . She is making a sacrifice for her cousin . " Henry thought of Abraham and Isaac . " I hope Lottie does n\'t make a sacrifice of her . " Vi laughed . " You \'re letting your imagination run away with you . Do n\'t go           mother again tomorrow . " " Yes . " That was much better . " What time do you think she \'ll come ? " " Well , you \'ve got a busy day tomorrow , out with Willy Snoddy and his ferrets . I should think about tea-time . When you get back , she \'ll be here . " " Do you think she \'ll bring me a present from London ? " " Sure to . " s " Perhaps she \'ll bring you a present , too . " " Oh , I do n\'t expect a present . Besides , it \'s my birthday soon , so I \'ll get one then . She always gives me something quite special , something that I never realized how much I wanted . " p151 " What day is your birthday ? " He had forgotten . " The fifteenth of September . The day before the Steyntons \' party . " " Are you going to have the picnic ? " Vi always arranged a picnic for her birthday . Everybody came , and they all           cooked sausages , and Vi brought her birthday cake in a big box , and when she cut it , the assembled party stood around and sang " Happy Birthday to You . " Sometimes it was a chocolate cake , and sometimes it was an orange cake . Last year it had been an orange cake . He remembered last year . Remembered the inclement day , the racing wind and the scattered showers that had dampened nobody \'s enthusiasm . Last year he had given Vi a picture that he had drawn with his felt pens , and which his mother had had framed and mounted , just like a proper picture . Vi had it hanging in her bedroom . This year he was giving her the bottle of rhubarb wine that he had won in the raffle at the church sale . This year . . . He said , " This year , I sha n\'t be there . " " No . This year , you \'ll be at boarding-school . " " Could n\'t you have your birthday earlier , so that I           birthdays do n\'t work that way . But it wo n\'t be the same without you . " " Will you write me a letter , and tell me all about it ? " " Of course I will . And you shall write to me . There \'ll be such a lot that I will want to hear . " He said , " I do n\'t want to go . " " No . I do n\'t suppose you do . But your father thinks that you should go , and he nearly always knows best . " " Mummy does n\'t want me to go , either . " " That \'s because she loves you so . She knows that she \'ll miss you . " He realized then that this was the first time he and Vi had talked about f his going away . This was because Henry did not even want to think about it , let alone discuss it , and Vi had never brought the subject up . But now they had started speaking about it , he discovered that he           to Vi , and knew , too , that she would never repeat it . He said , " They \'ve been quarrelling . They \'ve been cross with each other . " " Yes , " said Vi . " I know . " " How do you know , Vi ? " " I may be old , but I \'m not stupid . And your father is my son . Mothers \' know lots about their sons . The good bits and the not-so-good bits . It p152 does n\'t stop them loving them , but it makes them a little bit more under-standing . " " It \'s been so horrid , with them so unkind to each other . " " It must have been . " " I do n\'t want to go away to school , but I hate them being cross with each other . I simply hate it . It makes the house feel all headachy and ill . " Vi sighed . " If you want to know what I think , Henry , I think they \'ve both been           able to say anything , because it \'s none of my business . That \'s another thing a mother must n\'t do . She must never interfere . " " I really want to go home tomorrow , but . . . " He gazed at her , his sentence left unfinished , because he did n\'t really know what he was trying to say . Vi smiled . When she smiled her face creased into a thousand wrinkles . She laid her hand on his . It felt warm and dry , and rough from all the gardening she did . She said , " There \'s an old saying , that parting makes the heart grow fonder . Your mother and father have had a few days apart , on their own , with time to think things over . I \'m sure they \'ll both have realized how wrong they both have been . You see , they love each other very much , and if you love someone , you need to be with them , close to them . You need to be able to           as important as breathing . By now , I \'m certain that they will have found this out . And I \'m just as certain that everything will be just as it was before . " " Really certain , Vi ? " " Really certain . " She sounded so certain that Henry felt that way too . Such a relief . It was as though a huge weight had dropped from his shoulders . And this made everything much better . Even the prospect of leaving home and parents and being sent to board at Templehall had lost some of its fearfulness . Nothing could be as bad as thinking that his home would never be the same again . Reassured , and filled with grateful love for his grandmother , he held out his arms , and she leaned forward , and he embraced her , hugging her tight around her neck and pressing kisses on her cheek . When he drew back , he saw that her eyes were very shiny and bright . She said , " It \'s time to sleep . " He           lay back on the pillow and felt beneath it for Moo . Vi laughed at him , but gently , teasing him . " You do n\'t need that old bit of baby blanket . You \'re a grown-up boy now . You can make fairy p153 cakes , and do jigsaw puzzles , and remember the names of all those wild flowers . I think you can do without Moo . " Henry screwed up his nose . " But not tonight , Vi . " " All right . Not tonight . But tomorrow , maybe . " " Yes . " He yawned . " Maybe . " She stooped to kiss him , and then got up off the bed . The springs creaked once more . " Good night , my lamb . " " Good night , Vi . " She turned out his light and went out of the room , but she left the door open . The darkness was soft and blowy and smelt of the hills . Henry turned on his side , curled up in a ball , and           TEN YEARS AGO , VIOLET AIRD bought Pennyburn from Archie Balmerino , she had become owner of a sad and drab little house with little to commend it save its view and the small stream that tumbled down the hill on the western march of its land . It was from this stream that the house took its name . It stood in the heart of Archie \'s estate , on the face of the hill that sloped up from the village , and access was by the Croy back drive and then a rutted track overgrown by thistles and fenced by sagging posts and broken barbed wire . The garden , such as it was , lay on the slope to the south of the house . This too was surrounded by rotting posts and straggling wire , and consisted of a small drying-green , a weedy vegetable patch , and dismal evidences of hen-keeping -- leaning wooden sheds , much wire netting , and nettles grown waist-high . The house was built of dull coloured stone , with a grey-tiled roof and maroon paintwork in a sad state           to the door , and inside were small and lightless rooms , hideous peeling wallpaper , the smell of damp , and the persistent drip of \' some faulty tap . In fact , so unattractive was the entire property that Edmund Aird , viewing it for the first time , strongly recommended that his mother abandon the idea of ever living there and start to look for somewhere else . But Violet , for reasons of her own , liked the house . It had stood empty for some years , which accounted for its dereliction , but despite the mould and the gloom , it had a pleasant feel to it . And it had that little burn within its lands , tumbling away down the hill . And , as well , the view . Inspecting the house , Violet would pause from time to time to glance out , p155 rubbing a clear space on the dusty glass of the windows , seeing the village below , the river , the glen , the distant hills . She would never find another house with such a           and she disregarded her son \'s advice . Doing it all up had been tremendous fun . It had taken six months to complete the work , and during that time Violet -- politely spurning Ed-mund \'s invitation to remain at Balnaid until such time as she could move into her new abode -- camped in a caravan that she had rented from a tourist park a few miles up the glen . She had never lived in a caravan before , but the idea had always appealed to her gypsy instincts and she leaped at the chance . The caravan was parked at the back of the house , along with the concrete mixers and barrows and shovels and daunting piles of rubble , and from the open door she could keep an eye on the workmen , and dash out to have a word with the long-suffering architect the moment she spied his car come bumping up the road . For the first month or two of this cheerfully vagabond existence , it was summer , and the only hazards were the midges and a leaky roof whenever           the caravan trembled beneath their blast and rocked unsteadily at its temporary mooring , not unlike a small boat in a storm . Violet found this quite exciting and relished the dark and gusty nights . She could lie in her bunk , which was far too short and too narrow for such a sizy lady , listening to the keening wind and watching the clouds racing across the cold , moonlit skies . But she did not spend all her time alternately bullying and cajoling the builders . To Violet , a garden was even more important than a house . Before the workmen had started in on their labours , she had already engaged a man with a tractor , who tore up all the old fence posts and broken wire . In their place she planted a beech hedge on either side of her driveway and all around her small plot of land . After ten years , this was not high , but thick and firm , always leafy , and so providing good shelter for birds . Within this hedge , on either side ,           Not her favourites , but quick-growing and good for keeping the Horst of the coldest wind at bay . On the west , overhanging the stream , ? r ew gnarled elder , willows , and double white cherries . At the foot of the garden she had kept her planting low , in order to conserve the view . Azaleas grew there , and potentillas , with drifts of spring bulbs in the hough grass . There were two curving flower-beds , one herbaceous and one filled th roses , and between them a good-sized lawn . This was on the slope tricky to cut . Violet had bought an electric lawn-mower , but Ed-156 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p156 mund -- interfering again -- decided that she was likely to sever the flex and electrocute herself , and so engaged the services of Willy Snoddy to come once a week and do the job for her . Violet knew perfectly well that Willy was a great deal less competent than she herself at handling complicated equipment , but she went along with the arrangement as being the line of least           low with a killing hangover , did not turn up , and then Violet , quite happily and efficiently , cut the grass herself . But she did not tell Edmund that she had done so . As for the house , that she had transformed , turning it back to front and opening out all the poky and ill-proportioned rooms . Now the main entrance stood to the north and the old front door had become a glassed garden door , opening straight out of her sitting-room . The concrete stairs she had demolished , and in their place stood a semi-circular flight of steps built of old stone salvaged from a fallen dyke . Aubrietia and scented thyme grew from crannies between these rocks and smelt delicious when one trod upon them . After some consideration , Violet decided that she could not bear the dull colour of the stone walls of Pennyburn , and so had them all harled and painted white . Windows and doorways were outlined in black , which gave the face of the house a crisp and down-to-earth appearance . To embellish it           ten years , it had scarcely grown as high as her shoulder . By the time it reached the roof , she would probably be dead . At seventy-seven one was perhaps better off sticking to hardy annuals . All that was missing was a conservatory . The one at Balnaid had been built at the same time as the house . Its erection was due to the insistence of Violet \'s mother , Lady Primrose Akenside , a woman not addicted to the great outdoors . It was Lady Primrose \'s opinion that , if forced to live in the wilds of Scotland , a conservatory was absolutely essential . Quite apart from the fact that it was useful for keeping the house supplied with pot plants and grapes , it was somewhere to sit when the sun shone and yet the wind blew with an edge like ice to it . Such days , everybody knew , occurred with amazing frequency during the winter and spring and autumn months . But Lady Primrose spent a good deal of the summers in her conservatory as well , entertaining her           conservatory for less social reasons , relishing the warmth , the peace , the smell of damp earth and ferns and freesias . When the weather was too inclement to garden , you could always potter about in the conservatory , and what better place to sit down after lunch and try to do The Times crossword ? p157 Yes , she missed it , but after deliberation had decided that Pennyburn was too small and modest for such an extravagant addition . It would make the house look pretentious and foolish , and she was not about to inflict such an indignity upon her new home . And it was scarcely a hardship to sit in her sheltered and sunny garden and try to do the crossword there . She was in her garden now , and had been out working all afternoon , staking clumps of Michaelmas daisies before the autumn winds arrived to ell them flat . It was a day to start thinking about autumn . Not cold but sh , with a certain smell about the air , a briskness . The . farmers were           in tall elds of barley was seasonal and strangely reassuring . The sky was blue t sailing with clouds blown in from the west . A blinking day , the old untry people called it , as the sun went in and out . Unlike many people , Violet did not mourn the passing of the summer nd the prospect of a long dark winter ahead . " How can you bear to live Scotland ? \' she was sometimes asked . " The weather so unpredictable , much rain , so cold . " But Violet knew that she could not bear to live ywhere else , and never yearned to move away . When Geordie was alive ey had travelled together extensively . They had explored Venice and tanbul , paced the art galleries of Florence and Madrid . One year they d taken an archaeological cruise to Greece ; another time had sailed the rds of Norway , as far north as the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun . ut without him , she knew no urge to journey abroad . She preferred to ay right           a countryside at she had known since she was a child . As for the weather , she disrerded it , caring not if it froze or snowed or blew or rained or scorched , o vided she could be out of doors and part of it all . Which was proved by her complexion , weather-beaten and lined as an farm worker \'s . But again , at seventy-seven , what did a few wrinkles tter ? A small price to pay for an energetic and active old age . he drove in the last stake , twisted the last length of wire . Finished . stepped back onto the grass to survey her work . The canes showed , once the Michaelmas daisies had thickened out a bit , they would be ealed . She looked at her watch . Nearly half past three . She sighed , ys reluctant to stop gardening and go indoors . But she stripped off 158 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p158 her gloves and dropped them into her wheelbarrow , then collected her tools , the last of the canes , the drum of           her garage , where all was stowed neatly away until the next day \'s labour . Then she went into the house by the kitchen door , toeing off her rubber boots and hanging her jacket on a hook . In the kitchen , she filled the kettle and switched it on to boil . She laid a tray with two cups and saucers , a milk jug , a sugar bowl , and a plate of chocolate digestive biscuits . ( Virginia would not eat anything at teatime but Violet was never averse to a small snack . ) She went upstairs to her bedroom , washed her hands , found a pair of \' shoes , tidied her hair , slapped a bit of face powder onto her shining nose . As she did this , she heard the car come up the hill and turn into the lane . A moment later came the slam of its door , her own front door opening , and Virginia \'s voice . " Vii " " Just coming . " She settled her pearls , fixed a stray wisp           in the hall waiting for her ; her long legs were in corduroys and a leather jacket was slung around her shoulders . She had a new hair-do , Violet noticed , drawn back from her brow and fastened at the nape of her neck with a ribbon bow . She looked , as always , casually elegant , and happier than Violet had seen her for a long time . " Virginia . How lovely to have you home again . And how chic you look . I love the hair . " They kissed . " Did you have it done in London ? " " Yes . I thought perhaps it was time I changed my image . " She looked about her . " Where \'s Henry ? " " He \'s out ferreting with Willy Shoddy . " " Oh , Vi . " " It \'s all right . He \'ll be home in half an hour . " " I did n\'t mean that . I meant what \'s he doing spending his time with that old reprobate ? " " Well ,           all in school . And he got talking to Willy when he came to cut the grass this week , and Willy invited him to go ferreting . He seemed very keen to go , so I said he could . You do n\'t disapprove , do you ? " Virginia laughed and shook her head . " No , of course not . It \'s just rather unexpected . Do you think Henry realizes what ferreting entails ? It \'s quite a bloodthirsty business . " " I \'ve no idea . We \'ll doubtless hear all about it when he gets back . Willy will see that he \'s on time , I know . " p159 " I always thought you thought the old drunk was quite undepend-able . " " He would n\'t dare break his promise to me , and he never gets drunk in the afternoons . Now , how are you ? Did you have a good time ? " " A great time . Here . . . " She thrust a flat package , impressively wrapped , into Violet \'s hands           City . " " My dear , you did n\'t need to . " " It \'s a thank-you for having Henry , " " I \'ve loved having him . But he \'s longing to see you and go home to Balnaid . He was all packed up and ready long before breakfast this morning . Now , I want to hear all about everything . Come and watch me open my present . " She led the way into her sitting-room and settled herself in comfort in her own fireside chair . It was a relief to get the weight off her feet . Virginia perched herself on the arm of the sofa and watched . Violet undid e ribbon bow and unwrapped the paper . A flat box , orange and brown , as revealed . She removed the lid . Inside , folded and silken beneath the yers of tissue paper , was a Hermes scarf . " Oh , Virginia . This is far too much . " " No more than you deserve . " " But having Henry was a treat . "           It \'s in the car . I thought he could en it here , before I take him home . " The scarf was all pinks and blues and greens . Just the thing for brighting up that grey woollen dress . " I ca n\'t thank you enough -- I \'m really lighted with it . And now . . . " She folded the scarf , returned it to its x , and set it aside . " Let \'s have a cup of tea , and you can tell me rything that \'s happened in London . I want to hear all the de- " When did you get back ? " " Yesterday evening , on the shuttle . Edmund met me at Turnhouse and went into Edinburgh and had dinner at Rafaelli \'s , and after that we leave home to Balnaid. " " 1 hope " ? Violet fixed Virginia with a firm stare ? " that you used the e together to sort out your differences , " 160 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p160 Virginia had the grace to look abashed . " Oh ,           It was obvious to anyone but a blind man . I did n\'t say anything , but you must realize that it \'s very worrying for Henry if you and his father are not on good terms . " " Did Henry talk to you about it ? " " Yes , he did . He \'s much upset . I think he feels that going to Ternplehall is bad enough , but having you and Edmund at each other \'s throats is more than he can bear . " " We were n\'t exactly at each other \'s throats . " " Icy politeness is almost worse . " " I know . And I \'m sorry . And Edmund and I have made it up . By that I do n\'t mean anything \'s changed . Edmund wo n\'t budge from his decision , and I still think it \'s a dreadful mistake . But at least we \'ve called a truce . " She smiled and held out a slender wrist circled by a wide bracelet of gold . " Over dinner , he gave me this           be churlish to carry on sulking . " " That is a great relief to me . I managed to persuade Henry that you would both have come to your senses and would be friends again . And I \'m grateful to you both , because now I do n\'t feel that I am letting him down . He needs a lot of reassurance , Virginia . A lot of security . " " Oh , Vi , do n\'t I know it ? " " And there \'s another thing . He \'s very bothered about Edie . He \'s frightened of Lottie . He thinks that Lottie might harm Edie in some way . " Virginia frowned . " Did he say so ? " " We talked about it . " " Do you think he \'s right ? " " Children are perceptive . Like dogs . They recognize evil where , perhaps , we adults do n\'t see it . " " Evil is a strong word , Vi . I know she gives me the shivers , but I \'ve always told myself she           n\'t know , " said Violet . " But I \'ve promised Henry that we will all keep a weather eye on the situation . And if he talks to you about it , you must listen to him , and try to set his mind at rest . " " Of course . " " Now . " With that necessary exchange safely disposed of , Violet steered the conversation into a more cheerful direction . " Tell me about London . Did you get a dress ? And what else did you do ? And did you see Alexa ? " " Yes . " Virginia leaned forward to refill her cup from the teapot . " Yes , p161 I did get a dress , and yes , I did see Alexa . That \'s what I want to talk to you about . I \'ve already told Edmund . " Violet \'s heart sank . What on earth was happening now ? " She \'s all right ? " " Never better . " Virginia leaned back in her chair . " There is a man           man ? But that \'s splendid news ! I was beginning to ink that nothing exciting was ever going to happen to the dear child . " " They \'re living together , Vi . " For an instant , Violet was silenced . Then : " Living together ? " " Yes . And I \'m not telling tales out of school . She particularly asked me let you know . " " And where are they living together ? " " At Ovington Street . " " But . . . " Violet , flustered , sought for words . " But ... how long s this been going on ? " " About two months . " " Who is he ? " " He \'s called Noel Keeling . " " What does he do ? " " He \'s in advertising . " " How old is he ? " " About my age . Good-looking . Very charming . " About Virginia \'s age . A dreadful thought occurred to Violet . " I hope s not already married . " " No .           ? " " Alexa is radiantly happy . " " Do you think they will marry ? " " I have no idea . " " Is he kind to her ? " " I think so . I only saw him for a little while . He came home from the ce and we all had a drink together . He brought Alexa flowers . And he n\'t know I was going to be there , so he did n\'t buy them to impress Violet fell silent , trying to come to terms with this astonishing revela- . They were living together . Alexa was living with a man . Sharing a , sharing a life . Unmarried . She did not approve but her own opinions e best kept to herself . All that mattered was that Alexa should know t they all would support her , whatever might happen . " What did Edmund say when you told him ? " p162 Virginia shrugged . " Not a lot . He \'s certainly not about to fly to London with a loaded shotgun . But I think           Alexa is a girl of some wealth . . . she has that house and she has the money she inherited from Lady Cheriton . Which , as Edmund pointed out , is considerable . " " He \'s afraid this young man is after her money ? " " It \'s a possibility , Vi . " " You \'ve met him . What do you think of him ? " " I liked him . . . . " " But you have reservations ? " " He \'s so personable . Cool . Like I said , charming . I \'m not certain if I trust him .... " " Oh dear . " " But that \'s just me talking . I may be making a total misjudgement . " " What can we do ? " " We ca n\'t do anything . Alexa is twenty-one , she must make her own decisions . " Violet knew that . this was true . But Alexa . so far away . In Lon-don . " If only we could meet him . That would put everything           entirely agree with you , and you will meet him . " Violet glanced at her daughter-in-law and saw that she was smiling , looking as pleased with herself as the cat that got the cream . " I \'m afraid I stuck my oar in and made noises like a mother . I talked to the two of them and they \'ve agreed to come north together for the weekend of the Steyntons \' dance . They \'re going to stay at Balnaid . " " Oh , what a clever idea ! " Violet could have kissed Virginia , so delighted was she . " What a brilliant girl you are . Quite the best way of doing things , without making too much of an occasion of it . " " That \'s what I thought . And even Edmund approves . But we \'ll have to be very casual and tactful and matter-of-fact . No suggestive glances or meaningful remarks . " " You mean I \'m not to say anything about their getting married ? " Virginia nodded . Violet thought about this . "           modern to know when to hold my tongue . But , by living together , young people create for themselves such difficult situations . They make it so difficult for us . If v. ? e make too much of the young man , then he will think he is being pressurized and he \'ll back off and break Alexa \'s heart . And if we do n\'t make enough of him , Alexa will think we , disapprove and that will break her heart . " p163 " I would n\'t be too sure about that . She \'s grown up a lot . She has much more confidence . She \'s changed . " " I could n\'t bear her to be hurt . Not Alexa . " " I \'m afraid we ca n\'t protect her any longer . The affair has already gone too far . " " Yes , " said Violet , feeling in some way admonished . This was no time for apprehensive sentiment . If she was to be of any use to anybody , then she must remain sensible . "           But there was no time for more . They heard the front door open and slam shut . " Mummy ! " Henry was back . Virginia laid down her teacup and sprang to her feet , Alexa forgotten . She made for the door but Henry was there first , bursting in on them , red-cheeked with excitement and the effort of running up the hill . " Mummy ! " She held out her arms , and he flung himself , bodily , into them . p104 Saturday the Twenty-seventh EDMUND WAS FREQUENTLY ASKED , by well-meaning fellow-guests at dinner parties , if he did not find the long commute between Edinburgh and Strathcroy an almost unbearable strain , every morning and evening each day of the week that he was working in Edinburgh . But the truth was that Edmund thought nothing of the miles that he covered . Getting home to Balnaid and his family was more important than the considerable effort that it involved , and only a late business dinner in Edinburgh , an early plane to catch , or impassable winter roads persuaded           the flat in Moray Place . As well , he enjoyed driving . His car was both powerful and safe , and the motorway , slicing over the Forth and through Fife to Relkirk , had become as familiar as the back of his hand . Once through Relkirk , he was onto country roads that necessitated slowing down to a more prudent speed , but even so the journey rarely took him more than an hour . He used this time to switch off at the end of a day of stress and decision-making , and to let his mind concentrate instead upon the many other , but equally absorbing , facets of his busy life . In winter-time , he listened to the radio . Not the news nor political discussions . . . he had had enough of both by the time he finally cleared his desk and locked away all confidential documents . . . but Radio Three , classical concerts and erudite plays . For the rest of the year , as the hours of daylight lengthened and he no longer made the journey in           simply watching the unfolding seasons of the countryside . The ploughing , the sowing , the greening of the trees ; the first young lambs in the fields , the crops turning gold , the raspberry pickers out in the long drills of canes , the harvest , the autumn leaves , the first of the snows. p165 They were harvesting now , on this fine , blowy evening . The scenery was both peaceful and spectacular . Fields and farmlands were washed in fitful sunlight , but the air was so clear that every crag and corrie on the distant hills presented itself with startling visibility . The light flowed over these hills , touching their summits with reflected radiance ; the river runping alongside the road glittered and sparkled ; and the sky , skimming with clouds , was infinite . He felt more content than he had for a long time . Virginia was back , tored to him . His gift to her was the nearest he could get to an apology r the things that he had said on the day of the original explosion           him by her side for lfish reasons ; never thinking of any person but herself . She had acpted the bracelet with gratitude and love , and her unqualified pleasure as as good as forgiveness . Last night , after their dinner at Rafaelli \'s , he had driven her home to maid through a twilit countryside and beneath the banner of a spectacular skyscape , rose-pink to the west , and streaked as though by some rgantuan paintbrush with dark charcoal clouds . They had returned to an empty house . He could not remember when is had last happened , and it made their homecoming even more special . o dogs , no children ; just the two of them . He had dealt with the lugge , then taken two malt whiskies up to their bedroom and sat on the d and watched her unpack . There was no sense of urgency , because the hole of the house , the night , the sweet darkness belonged to them . ter , he showered ; Virginia took a bath . She came to him , scented and           love . He knew that the bone of contention still lay between them . Virginia d not want to lose Henry , and Edmund was determined that he should But for the time being they had ceased snarling over this particular ne and , with a bit of luck , it would stay buried and forgotten . As well , there were other good things to look forward to . This evening , would see his small son again after a week of separation . There would much to tell and much to hear . And then , next month , in September , exa was bringing her young man to stay . Virginia \'s bombshell about Alexa had caught Edmund unawares , renring him confounded but not shocked nor disapproving . He was exmely fond of his daughter , and recognized her many sterling qualities ; t during the last year or two he had privately wished , more than once , at she would take her finger out and start to grow up . At twenty-one , r lack of sophistication , her shyness , her dumpy shape           to being surrounded by elegant and 166 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p166 worldly women ( even his secretary was a stunner ) and disliked himself for his own impatience and irritation with Alexa . But now , all by herself , she had found a man , and a personable one , if Virginia was to be be-lieved . Possibly he should be taking a tougher line . But he had never relished the image of himself as a paterfamilias , and was more concerned with the human side of the situation rather than the moral . As always , when faced with a dilemma , he planned to go by his own set of rules . Act positively , plan negatively , expect nothing . The worst that could happen would be Alexa \'s getting hurt . For her , it would be a frightening new experience , but at least she would come out of it more adult and , hopefully , stronger . He drove into Strathcroy as the church clock was striking seven . He thought , in pleasant anticipation , of getting home . The dogs would           and Henry , in his bath or eating his tea in the kitchen . He would sit with Henry while he consumed his fish fingers or beefburgers or whatever horror he had chosen to eat , listening to all that Henry had been up to during the week , and drinking , meanwhile , a very long and strong gin and tonic . Which reminded him that they were out of tonic . The drink cupboard had been allowed to run dry of this precious commodity , and Edmund had meant to stop off and buy a crate before he left Edinburgh , but had forgotten to do this . And so he passed the bridge that led to Balnaid and drove on into the village , drawing up outside the Pakistani supermarket . All the other shops had long since shut their doors and closed their shutters , but the Pakistanis never seemed to close . Long after nine o\'clock in the evening they were still selling cartons of milk and bread and pizzas and frozen curries to anybody who wanted to buy them . He got out of           other customers but they were filling their own wire baskets from the shelves or being assisted by Mr. Ishak , and it was Mrs. Ishak who dimpled at Edmund from behind the counter . She was a comely lady , with huge dark eyes ringed in kohl , and this evening dressed in butter-yellow silk . with a paler yellow silk scarf draped around her head and shoulders . " Good evening , Mr. Aird . " " Good evening , Mrs. Ishak . How are you ? " p167 " I am very well , thank you for asking . " " How \'s Kedejah ? " " She is watching television . " " I hear she had an afternoon at Pennyburn with Henry . " " That is true , and my God , she came home soaking wet . " Edmund laughed . " They were building dams . I hope you were n\'t an-noyed . " " Not at all . She has had a most lovely time . " " I want some tonic water , Mrs. Ishak . Have you got some ?           you need ? " " Two dozen ? " " If you wait , I will fetch them for you from the store . " " Thank you . " She went . Edmund , unimpatient , stood waiting for her to return . A voice spoke from behind him . " Mr. Aird . " It was so close , just behind his shoulder , that he was much startled . He swung around and found himself faced by Edie \'s cousin , Lottie Carstairs . Since she had come to stay with Edie , he had glimpsed her once or twice , pottering about the village , but had taken some pains and avoiding action , not wishing to be confronted by her . Now it seemed she had him cornered and there was no escape . " Good evening . " " Remember me ? " She spoke almost coyly . Edmund did not relish finding himself so close to her with her pallid , bloodless skin and the strong suggestion of a moustache upon her upper lip . Her hair was the colour ? and roughly           arched eyebrows her eyes were brown as currants , and round and quite unwinking . Apart from all this , her appearance was reasonably normal . She wore a blouse and skirt , a long green cardigan perkily embellished with a sparling brooch , and shoes with high heels upon which she tottered slightly she engaged Edmund in conversation . " I used to be with Lady ilmerino , staying with Edie Findhorn right now I am . Seen you around the village , never had the chance of an old chin-wag ... " Lottie Carstairs . She must be nearly sixty now , and yet she had not anged so much since those days when she had worked at Croy and used every person in the house untold annoyance and aggravation , ith her stealthy tread and her habit of always appearing just when least anted or expected . Archie always swore that she listened at keyholes , and he had been perpetually throwing doors open in the expectation of itching Lottie there , crouched and eavesdropping . In the afternoons , 168 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p168 Edmund remembered ,           muslin apron tied over it . The muslin apron was not Lady Balmerino \'s idea but Lottie \'s . Archie said it was because she wanted to appear servile . The brown dress had stains under the armpits , and one of the worst things about Lottie was her smell . The family complained vociferously and Archie demanded that his mother take some step to rectify the situation . Either sack the bloody woman or do something to ensure a little personal daintiness . But poor Lady Balmerino , with Archie \'s wedding on her mind , every bed filled with guests and a party planned at Croy on the evening of the great day , did not feel strong enough to sack her housemaid . And she was far too kind-hearted actually to send for Lottie , face her fair and square , and tell her that she smelt . Under attack , she fell back on feeble excuses . " I must have someone to clean the rooms and make the beds . " " We \'ll make our own beds . " " Poor thing , she           buy her another . " " Perhaps she \'s nervous . " " Not too nervous to wash . Give her a bar of Lifebuoy . " " I \'m not certain that that would make much difference . Perhaps . . for Christmas . . . I could give her some talcum powder . . . ? " But even this timid notion came to nothing , for , soon after the wedding , Lottie dropped the tray and broke the Rockingham china , and Lady Balmerino was finally driven to firing her . By Christmas Lottie was gone from Croy . Now , trapped in Mr. Ishak \'s shop , Edmund wondered if she still smelt . He was not about to risk finding out . Trying not to make it too obvious , he moved a pace or two away from her . " Yes , " he said , sounding as pleasant and friendly as he could . " Of course , I remember you ... " " Those days at Croy ! The year Archie was wed to Isobel . Oh my , what times           for the wedding and around the place all that week , helping Lady Balmerino with one thing and another . " " It seems a long time ago . " " Yes . " " And all of you so young . And old Lord and Lady Balmerino so good and kind . Croy \'s changed now , I hear , and not for the better . But then , hard times come to everybody . It was a sad day when Lady Balmerino died . She was always so good to me . She was good to my parents too . My mother and my father died , You knew that , did n\'t you ? I \'ve been wanting p169 to talk to you , but somehow I missed you in the village . And all of you so young . And Archie with his two good legs . .. fancy getting his leg shot offl Never heard of anything so ridiculous . . . " Oh , Mrs. Ishak , come back quickly . Please , Mrs. Ishak , come back to e. hear all your news           , she \'s grown so fat , ca n\'t be good for her heart . And all of you so oung . And that Pandora ! Flying around the place like a spinning top . readful way she went , was n\'t it ? Funny she never came home . Always hought she might come back for Christmas , but no . And not to be there or Lady Balmerino \'s funeral , well , I \'m sorry and I do n\'t like to say such ings , but in my view , it was downright un-Christian . But then , she ! ways was a wee fly-by-night . in more ways than one . . . you nd I know that , do n\'t we ? " At this point she burst into a peal of manic laughter and actually truck Edmund a playful , but quite painful , blow on his arm . His immeate and instinctive reaction was to hit her right back , a good punch , ng , square on the end of her long , inquisitive nose . He imagined it umpling , concertinaed           the al newspapers : " Relkirkshire Landowner Assaults Strathcroy Lady In illage Supermarket . " He thrust his hands , the fists balled , into his user pockets . ... and your wife \'s been in London ? Nice . And the wee boy with s gran . Seen him sometimes around the place . He is peaky , is n\'t he ? " mund could feel the blood rising to his cheeks . He wondered how long could continue to control himself . He could not remember when any on had cast him into such a confusion of impotent rage . " ... small his age , I \'d say . . . not strong ... " " I am sorry , Mr. Aird , to keep you so long " It was Mrs. Ishak \'s soft ice that finally stilled the flood of Lottie \'s mindless malice . Mrs. Ishak , s her darling heart , come to his rescue with the cardboard crate of is water borne before her like a votive offering . " Oh , thank you , Mrs. Ishak . " And not a           . " He went to relieve her of the heavy load . " I wonder , can u put that down to my account ? " He could easily pay in cash but did t wish to linger a moment longer than he had to . " Of course , Mr. Aird . " " Thank you . " The crate was transferred . With its weight safely in his s , he turned to take his leave of Lottie and make his escape . But Lottie had jumped the gun and was gone . Abruptly and disconingly , she had simply disappeared . p170 Tuesday the Thirtieth " HAS SHE ALWAYS LIVED IN MAJORCA , this aunt of yours ? " " No . She \'s only been here for about two years . She lived in Pa \' before that , and New York before that , and then California before that , Lucilla said . " A rolling stone . " " Yes , I suppose you could call her that , except that she \'s gathered to \' of lovely moss . " Jeff laughed .           n\'t know because I \'ve never seen her . By the time I was born , s was gone , married to an immensely wealthy American and living in Pal Springs . It seemed to me that she must be the most glamorous woman the world . So wicked and sophisticated like someone out of those of 1930 plays , with men falling for her like ninepins , and always u ashamedly outrageous . She eloped when she was eighteen . Such a frigh fully brave thing to do . I \'d never have had the nerve . And she was beauti ful . " " Will she still be beautiful ? " " I do n\'t see why not . After all , she \'s only about forty , not over the W i yet . There \'s a portrait of her at Croy in the dining-room . It was paint when she was about fourteen and even then she was a stunner . An photographs too , all over the place , in frames or the old albums that my grandfather used to fill with snapshots . I           them poring over those old albums . And when people talked about her , even if they started by being disapproving because she \'d been so thoughtless and uncaring to her parents , they ways ended up by remembering some funny anecdote about Pandora , and then of course there could be nothing but laughter . " p171 " Was she surprised when you spoke to her on the telephone ? " " Of course she was . But pleased surprised , not horrified surprised . You can always tell . At first she could hardly believe it was me . But then she just said Of course you can come . As soon as possible . And stay for as long as you like . \' And she gave me directions and hung up . " Lucilla smiled . " So you see , we \'re good for at least a week . " They had hired a car , a little Seat , the cheapest they could get , and were now well on their way across the island , driving over flat , intensely cultivated countryside ,           afternoon and the road ahead of them shimmered in the heat . On their left , far-distant and hazy , marched a range of impassablelooking mountains . On the other side , somewhere out of sight , lay the sea . For air , they had opened all the windows of the car , but the wind was scorching and dusty and very dry . Jeff was driving and Lucilla sat beside him , holding the scrap of paper on which she had scribbled the directions that Pandora had given her over the telephone . She had rung Pandora from Palma , having arrived with Jeff that morning in a boat from Ibiza . They had spent a week in Ibiza , staying with Jai \'s friend , Hans Bergdorf . Hans was a painter and his house had taken some finding , being at the very top of the old town , within the ancient walls of the fortified city . Finally discovered , it had proved very picturesque . It was thick-walled and whitewashed , but primitive beyond belief . The views from its jutting stone balcony took           new town , the harbour , and the sea , but even this delight scarcely made up for the fact that any cooking had to be done on ? miniature Calor gas stove and the only running water came from a single cold tap . Consequently , both Jeff and Lucilla were extremely dirty , if not to say smelly , and the bulging backpacks piled onto the back seat of e car were stuffed with unsavoury , soiled and sweaty clothes . Lucilla , ver a girl to spend time worrying about her appearance , had started to ve fantasies about washing her hair , and Jeff in desperation had alwed his beard to grow . It was blonde like his hair , but uneven and straggly and made him look more like a down-and-out than a Viking . In t , the pair of them presented such a disreputable picture that it was a nder that the hire-car man had agreed to rent them the Seat . Lucilla id noticed a certain suspicion on his face , but Jeff had produced a wad of pesetas and , with           She said , " I hope Pandora \'s got a washing-machine . " " I \'d settle for a pool . " " You ca n\'t wash your clothes in a pool . " 172 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p172 " Want a bet ? " Lucilla gazed through the open car window . She saw that the mountains had drawn closer and the countryside become more lush . There were pine trees , and the smell of warm resin blew in through the open windows along with the dust . They came to a junction joining another main road . They paused for traffic to pass . The road sign was marked " Puerto del Fuego . " " Well , we \'re on the right track . What happens now ? " " We take the Puerto del Fuego road , but we have to turn off to the left in another mile or so . It \'s a little road and it \'s signposted to Cala San Torre . \' " The traffic thinned . Taking his chance Jeff cautiously negotiated the junction . " If we find ourselves           . " " That follows . " Now she could smell the sea . Houses appeared , a new apartment block , a garage . They passed a riding stables with scrubby paddocks where sad , bony horses tried to graze . " Oh , poor creatures , " said the tender-hearted Lucilla , but Jeff had eyes only for the road ahead . " There \'s a sign . Cala San Torre . \' " " That \'s it ! " They turned off the sun-baked dual carriageway and found themselves , abruptly , in a green and verdant countryside totally unlike the flat and exposed land through which they had been travelling . Umbrella pines threw shade across the road , speckled by sun splashes , and from ramshackle farms came the contented cackle of hens and the bleat of goats . " It \'s suddenly gone pretty , " Lucilla observed . " Oh , look at that sweet little donkey . " " Keep your eyes on the map , girl . What happens next ? " Lucilla obediently consulted her notes . " Well ,           and then we go right up a hill to the last house at the very top . They came upon the turning around the next corner . Jeff changed down and made the turn . The Seat , sounding as though at any moment it might boil like a kettle , ground painfully up the steep and winding lane . There were other houses , large villas scarcely glimpsed beyond closed gates and burgeoning gardens . " This , " said Lucilla , " is what estate agents call a much-sought-after neighbourhood . " " You mean snob . " " I think I mean expensive . " p173 " I think you do too . Your aunt must be loaded . " " She \'s got a Californian divorce , " Lucilla told him and her voice implied that there was no need to say more . Another hundred yards or so , another hairpin bend or two , and they bad reached their destination . Casa Rosa . The name , embellished on decorated tiles , was set into a high stone wall and clearly visible despite a           A riveway , deeply bordered , sloped up to a garage . The garage had a car rked in it , and another car -- an enviable silver BMW -- was parked in e shade of a gnarled olive tree . Jeff switched off the engine . It was very uiet . Then Lucilla heard water splashing , as though from a fountain , d the distant , gentle clangour of sheep bells . The mountains now were lose by , their summits bleached and barren , their lower slopes silvery ith groves of olive . They got slowly and gratefully out of the car , stretching their sweaty mbs . Up here , so high , there was a breeze blowing off the sea , cool and freshing . Lucilla , looking about her , saw that the Casa Rosa stood on a cky bluff above them , the main entrance reached by a flight of steps , he risers of these steps were set with blue-and-white tiles , and pots of raniums stood sentry all the way to the top . As well , all was entwined a           plumbago , d a tangle of azure-blue morning glory . The air was sweet with flowery nts mingled with the damp smell of newly watered earth . So amazing was it all , so unlike anything they had previously experiied , that for a moment neither of them could think of anything to say . en Lucilla whispered , " I \'d no idea it would be as grand as this ! " " Well , one thing \'s for sure , we ca n\'t stand here all day . " " No . " He was right . Lucilla turned towards the first step , leading the ay . But before she had mounted the first step , the silence was broken by e sound of sharp heel-taps , hurrying along the terrace above them . " Darlings ! " A figure appeared at the head of the stairs , arms outetched in welcome . " 1 heard the car . You \'ve come . And you \'ve not lost way . How clever you are and how perfect to see you , " Lucilla \'s first impression of           as though at any moment she might blow away . bracing her was like holding a little bird . You did n\'t want to hug too 174 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER. p174 hard in case she snapped in two . Her hair was chestnut brown , swept back from her forehead and falling , in frondy curls , to her shoulders . Lucilla guessed that Pandora had worn her hair that way when she was eighteen and had never seen any reason to change the style . Her eyes were dark grey , shadowed by sooty black lashes , and her curving mouth full and sweet . On her right cheek , just above the corner of her upper lip , was a round dark beauty spot , too sexy to be called a mole . She was dressed in loose pyjamas of the brilliant pink of the hibiscus flowers , and there were gold chains around her neck and knots of gold in her ears . She smelled . . . Lucilla knew that scent . Poison . She had tried wearing it herself but could never decide whether she loved           she was still not certain . " I \'d have known you were Lucilla , even if nobody had told me . Yo look so like Archie . . . . " It seemed that she did not even notice thei unsavoury appearance , their soiled cut-off shorts and grubby T-shirt And if she did , she gave no indication of objecting . " And you must Jeff . . . . " She held out a pink-tipped hand . " How wonderful that yo could come with Lucilla . " He took it in his own enormous paw and , looking a bit overwhelm by her welcome and her dazzling smile , said , " Pleased to meet you . " She picked up his accent at once . " You \'re an Australian ! How hea enly . I do n\'t think I \'ve ever had an Australian here before . Did you ha a hideous drive ? " " No . Not at all . Just hot . " " You must be longing for a drink .... " " Shall we get our stuff out of           later . A drink first . Come along , I \'ve a friend here you to meet . " Lucilla \'s heart sank . It did n\'t matter about Pandora , but they we certainly in no shape to be introduced to company . " Pandora , we \' dreadfully dirty . , .. " " Oh , heavens , that does n\'t matter . He wo n\'t mind ... " She turn from them and led the way , and there was no alternative but to follow down a long shaded and airy terrace furnished with white cane an butter-yellow cushions and great blue-and-white porcelain jars plant with palms . " He ca n\'t stay for very long and I want you to m him . . . . " They turned the corner of the house and , hard on Pandora \'s tappin heels , stepped out into blinding sunshine . Lucilla longed for her su glasses , left in the car . In a dazzle , she saw the wide , open terrace , shad p175 by striped awnings and paved in marble . Shallow steps led           flowering trees and shrubs . Grass the were set with flagged stepping-stones , and these encircled a swimming pool , aquamarine and still as glass . Just seeing it made Lucilla feel ler . An inflatable sun-bed floated upon the surface of the water , drift-g with the undercurrent of the filter . At the far end of the garden , half hidden by hibiscus , she saw another use , small and single-storied , but with its own little terrace facing out ver the pool . This was shaded by a tall umbrella pine , and beyond the \' dge of its roof there was nothing to be seen but the brazen blue sky . " Here they are , Carlos , safely arrived . My directions ca n\'t have been as infusing as we \'d feared . " At the top of the steps , in the shade of the wning , stood a low table . On this was a tray with glasses and a tall jug . n ashtray , a pair of sunglasses , a paperback . More cane chairs , yellowshioned , stood about           one of ese and stood , smiling , waiting to be introduced . He was tall and Barked and very handsome . " Lucilla , darling , this is my friend Carlos Maya . Carlos , this is Lucilla Blair , my niece . And Jeff . . . ? " " Howland , " Jeff supplied for her . " And he \'s Australian . Is n\'t that exciting ? Now , let \'s all sit down and ve a lovely drink . This is iced tea , but I can get Seraphina to bring mething stronger if you \'d like . Coke maybe ? Or wine ? " She began to ugh . " Or champagne ? What a good idea . But perhaps a little early in e day . Let \'s save the champagne till later . " They told her that iced tea would be perfect . Carlos drew forward a air for Lucilla and then settled himself beside her . But Jeff , who could k up sun like a lizard , went to lean on the balustrade of the terrace , d Pandora           sandal dangling from a toe . Carlos Macaya poured iced tea and handed Lucilla her glass . " You have come from Ibiza ? " " Yes , this morning , on the boat . " " How long were you there ? " His English was perfect . " A week . Staying with a friend of Jeff \'s . It was a lovely house but adfully primitive . Which is why we look so filthy . Because we are . I \'m rry . He made no comment on this ; simply smiled in an understanding way . And before Ibiza ? " " I \'ve been in Paris . That \'s where I met Jeff . I \'m meant to be a painter , t there was so much to see and so much to do , I did n\'t achieve very much . " p176 " Paris is a wonderful city . Was this your first visit ? " " No , I \'d been once before . I spent some time as an au pair , to learn the language . " " And how           We thought of hitch-hiking but in the end we travelled by bus . We did the journey in stops and starts , staying in gites , and taking time to do some sightseeing . Cathedrals and wine chateaux -- that sort of thing . " " You have not been wasting your time . " He glanced at Pandora , chattering away to Jeff , who watched her intently as though she were some strange species of wildlife that he had never before observed . " Pandora tells me that this is the first time you have met each other . " " Yes . " Lucilla hesitated . This man was probably Pandora \'s current lover , which meant that now was neither the time nor the place to enlarge on Pandora \'s youthful elopement and subsequent life-style . " She was always abroad , you see . I mean , living abroad . " " And your home is in Scotland ? " " Yes . In Relkirkshire . That \'s where my parents live . " A small pause fell . She took a mouthful of iced           " " No . I studied in Oxford for a couple of years " ( that explained his English ) , " but I never found time to go to Scotland . " " We \'re always wanting Pandora to come back and see us , but she never will . " " Perhaps she does n\'t like the cold and the rain . " " It is n\'t cold and rainy all the time . Only some of the time . " He laughed . " Whatever . It is a splendid thing that you have come to keep her company . And now . . . " He pushed back his silk cuff and glanced at his watch . It was a handsome and unusual watch , the numbers marked by tiny replicas of yachting pennants , and was strapped to his wrist by a heavy gold bracelet . Lucilla wondered if Pandora had given it to him . Perhaps the pennants spelt out " I Love You " in naval code . " . . . it is time for me to take my leave . I           do . . . . " " Of course .... " He rose once more to his feet . " Pandora , I must go . " " Oh dear , what a shame . " She fixed her sandal and hopped down off the balustrade . " Never mind , you \'ve had time to meet my guests . We \'ll come and see you off . " " Do n\'t disturb everybody . " " They \'ve got to get their luggage anyway . They \'re dying to unpack and have a swim . Come . . . . " She took his arm . And so they all made their way back to where his car was waiting in p177 the shade beneath the olive tree . Goodbyes were said , he sketched a kiss over the back of Pandora \'s hand , and then got in behind the wheel of the BMW . He started up the engine , and Pandora stood back . But before he drove way , he said , " Pandora . " " Yes , Carlos ? " " You will           She did not answer immediately , and then shook her head . " I sha n\'t hange my mind , " she told him . He smiled , shrugged resignedly , as though good-naturedly accepting er decision . He put the car into gear and , with a final wave , left them , riving away , through the gates , down the hill , out of sight . They stood siting until the sound of the BMW could be heard no longer . Only the ash of water from that unseen fountain , the tinkle of sheep bells . You will let me know if you change your mind What had Carlos been asking of Pandora ? For an instant Lucilla toyed ith the idea that he had been proposing marriage , but almost at once ut this notion out of her head . It was too prosaic for such a sophistited and glamorous pair . More likely , he had been trying to persuade r to join him on some romantic trip , to the Seychelles or the palmnged beaches of Tahiti . Or perhaps he had simply           like going . Whatever , Pandora was not about to enlighten them . Carlos was gone d now she sprang into practical activity , giving a little clap with her nds . " So . Down to business . Where \'s your luggage ? Is that all ? No tcases or cabin trunks or hat-boxes ? I take more than that if I go away r a single night . Now , come along .... " She started up the steps once more , going at a great pace , and yet again cy followed her , Lucilla carrying her leather satchel , and Jeff lugging e two bulging backpacks . " I \'ve put you in the guest-house . You can make yourselves at home , d then be quite independent . And I \'m not frightfully good in the morngs , so you \'ll have to get your own breakfast . The fridge is full of goodand there \'s coffee and stuff in the cupboard . " They were now back on terrace . " You \'ll be all right ? " " Of course . " "           o\'clock . Just someng cold , because I ca n\'t cook to save my life , and Seraphina , my maid , home each evening . But she \'ll leave everything ready for us . Come r at half past eight and we \'ll have a drink . Now I \'m going to have a 178 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p178 little nap , so I \'ll leave you to find your own way and settle yourselves in . Later , I might swim before I change for dinner . " The prospect of Pandora , dressed in an even grander outfit than the pink silk pyjamas , brought up the vexing question of clothes . " Pandora , we have n\'t got anything to change into . Nearly everything \'s dirty . Jeff \'s got one clean shirt , but it has n\'t been ironed . " " Oh , darling , do you want to borrow something ? " " A clean T-shirt ? " " Of course , how stupid of me , I should have offered . Wait a moment . " They waited . She disappeared through           , and returned almost at once bearing a midnight-blue silk shirt splashed with a rocket-fall of sequins . " Have this , it \'s frightfully vulgar but rather fun . You can keep it if you want , I never wear it . " She tossed it over and Lucilla caught it . " And now , off you go and dig yourselves into your little nest . If you want anything , ring through on the house phone and Seraphina will bring it to you . " She blew a kiss . " Half past eight . See you then . " And she was gone , leaving Lucilla and Jeff to their own devices . But still Lucilla hesitated , savouring the anticipation of what was about to happen next . " Jeff , I ca n\'t believe it . We \'ve got a whole house to ourselves . " " So what are we waiting for ? If I do n\'t get into that pool in tw minutes flat , I \'m going to explode . " Lucilla went first , leading the way down the steps           house awaited them . They crossed the terra and opened the door into a living-room . Curtains had been drawn , an Lucilla went to pull them back . Light streamed in and she saw the litt patio on the far side , the sheltered scrap of garden . " We \'ve even got our own place to sunbathe ! " There was an open fireplace , stacked with logs . There were a few coma fortable chairs , a tray of drinks and glasses , a coffee-table stacked neat ) with magazines , and a wall shelved with books . Opening other doo they found two double bedrooms , and a bathroom of marvellously s cious proportions . " I think this is the nicest bedroom . It \'s certainly the biggest . " J dumped the backpacks onto the tiled floor and Lucilla drew back mo curtains . " We can see the sea from here . Just a little scrap , a triangle , but still a view of the sea . " She opened cupboard doors , saw rows of padded hangers , smelled lavender .           , where it hung in lonely style . Jeff had toed off his trainers and was stripping off his T-shirt . p179 " You can play house as much as you like . I \'m going to swim . You Joining me ? " " I will in a moment . " He departed . An instant later she heard the splash as he took his running dive , and imagined the silken bliss of the cool water . But later . Just now she wanted to explore . On detailed inspection Pandora \'s guest-house proved to be quite perfectly complete , and Lucilla was filled with admiration for such meticulous thought and planning . Someone . . . and who else but Pandora ? ... had somehow thought of anything that a visitor might want or need , from fresh flowers and lovely new books right down to spare blanets for chilly nights and hot-water bottles for possibly unsettled tumies . The bathroom was supplied with every sort of soap , scent , shamo , aftershave , body-lotion , and bath-oil . There were thick white bath wels and           door , a pair of oluminous and snowy-white towelling bathrobes . Leaving all this luxury , she crossed the sitting-room and went in arch of the kitchen , and found it sparkling neat , and lined with dark ooden cupboards filled with Spanish pottery , shining saucepans , casseles , and a complete batterie de cuisine . If one wanted -- which Lucilla id n\'t -- it would be quite possible to concoct a dinner party for ten . There were an electric cooker and a gas cooker and a dishwasher and a ridge . She opened the fridge and discovered there , along with all the xings for a robust breakfast , two bottles of Perrier water and a bottle of ampagne . A second door led out of the kitchen . She opened this and nd . . . joy of joys . . . a compact laundry with clothes washer , mg-lines , an ironing-board , and an iron . The sight of these homely s gave her more satisfaction than all the other luxuries put together . ause now , at last , they could be           . Went back to the bathroom , stripped her clothes , put on one of the towelling robes and then started in on unpacking . Which consisted of emptying the contents of the kpacks onto the bedroom floor . At the bottom of her own backpack e her wash-bag , her brush and comb , her sketch-pad , a book or two , the envelope from her father , which had contained his cheque , his r , and the invitation to a dance from Verena Steynton . She took this of the envelope and propped it on the empty dressing-table . By now it a bit dog-eared but bestowed , she decided , a personal note to the , as though Lucilla had put her name to it and claimed it as her p180 Lucilla Blair Mrs. Angus Steynton At Home For Katy Why did it seem so ludicrous ? She laughed . Another life , another world away . She gathered up armfuls of dirty socks , shorts , jeans , pants , and T-shirts and headed back to the laundry . Without bothering to sort any of           she could see red socks going in with white shirts , but her mother was not here to remonstrate so what did it matter ? ) Lucilla stuffed the open face of the washingmachine , poured in detergent , slammed the door , and switched it on . Water gushed and the drum revolved , and she stood back and observed this with as much delight as if it had been a longed-for programme on television . Then she kicked aside the remainder of the dirty clothes , went to find her bikini , and joined Jeff in the pool . She swam for a long time . After a bit Jeff got out and lay in the sun to dry off . Another two lengths and she saw he was gone , had taken himself indoors . She came out of the pool and wrung the water from her long dark hair . She went indoors . She found him in the bedroom , flat out on one of the beds . He looked as though he might be going to sleep . She did not want him to           a running jump , and landed flat on top of him . " Jeff . " " Yeah ? " " I told you she was beautiful . " " Who ? " " Pandora , of course . " Jeff did not immediately reply to this . He was drowsy and on the edge of sleep , and not inclined to conversation . H is arm , out-flung , pillowed Lucilla \'s head . His skin smelled of chlorine and swimming pool . " Do n\'t you think she \'s beautiful ? " p181 " She \'s certainly one sexy sheila . " " You think she \'s sexy ? " " But too old for me . " " She does n\'t look old . " " And a bit too skinny as well . " " Do n\'t you like skinny ladies ? " " No . I like my women with big tits and fat bums . " Lucilla , who had inherited her shape from her father and was tall and thin and almost breastless , gave Jeff a thump with her fist . "           , what do you want me to say ? " " You know what I want you to say . " He pulled her face towards his own and kissed her soundly . " Will that do ? " " I think you \'ll have to shave that beard off . " " Now why should I do that ? " " Because my face is going to start looking as though it \'s been cleaned Off by sandpaper . " " I \'ll have to stop kissing you then . Or start kissing you someplace here it does n\'t show . " They fell silent . The sun was dropping in the sky , and soon , quite ddenly , it would be dark . Lucilla thought of Scottish summer twilights at went on until midnight . She said , " Do you think they \'re lovers ? Do ) u think they \'re having a raging affair ? " " Who ? " " Pandora and Carlos Macaya . " " I would n\'t know . " " He \'s terribly handsome . " " Yeah . A           . Rather cosy . Easy to talk to . " " I liked his car . " " You have a one-track mind . What do you think it was he asked her ? " " Come again ? " He said , Let me know if you change your mind . \' And she said , I n\'t change my mind . \' He must have asked her something . He must have wanted her to do something with him . " " Well , whatever it was , she did n\'t look too bothered . " But Lucilla was not satisfied . " I \'m certain it was something terribly ificant . A turning-point in both their lives . " " You have a runaway imagination . More likely he was trying to fix a nis game . " 182 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p182 " Yes . " But somehow , Lucilla did not feel that this was so . She sighed , and the sigh turned into a yawn . " Perhaps . " At half past eight they were ready to join Pandora , and Lucilla decided           look too bad . Both of them had showered and scrubbed and now smelled sweetly of the gratuitous shampoo . Jeff had neatened up his beard with a pair of nail scissors , and Lucilla had ironed his one clean shirt and salvaged from the pile of clothes on the laundry floor his tidiest pair of jeans . As for herself , she had washed her long dark hair and brushed it dry , pulled on a pair of black leggings , and now buttoned up the borrowed shirt . The heavy silk felt deliciously cool against her bare skin , and the sequined embroidery , viewed in the mirror through half-closed eyes , was not nearly as outrageous as she had first imagined . Perhaps it had something to do with these unaccustomed surroundings . Perhaps the ambience of enormous luxury helped absorb such small vulgarities . It was an interesting notion and one that she would have liked to discuss at lengt but right now there was no time . " Come on , " Jeff told her . " Time to be off . I need a           followed him , first making sure that all the lights in the guest-house were switched off . She was fairly certain that Pandora would not give a damn if every light was left burning , but , brought up by a thrifty Scottish mother , such small housewifely economies were engrained in Lucilla , as though her subconscious were a programmed computer . She found this strange , because later strictures had left as little impression as water on a duck \'s back . Another interestin thought worth chewing over at a later date . Out of doors , they stepped into a blue night , star-bright and soft an warm as velvet . The garden was headily fragrant , the swimming poo floodlit , and lamps lit the way along the stepping-stones of the path . Lucilla heard the incessant chirp of the cicadas , and there was music coming from Pandora \'s house . Rachmaninoff . The Second Piano Concerto . Banal , maybe , but perfect for just such a Mediterranean night . Pandora had set the scene and no she was waiting for them on the           the table beside her . p183 " There you are ! " she called as they approached . " I \'ve already opened the champagne . I could n\'t wait any longer . " They went up the steps and into the pool of light that illuminated their hostess . She had changed into something black and cobwebby and wore gold sandals on her bare feet . The smell of Poison was even stronger than the scents of the garden . " Do n\'t you both look sleek ! I ca n\'t think why you were so worried about yourselves . And Lucilla , the shirt is divine on you , you must keep it . Now , find chairs and settle down . Oh , blast , I \'ve forgotten the glasses . Lucilla , darling , go and get some , will you ? The little bar \'s just behind the door , you \'ll find everything there . There \'s a second bottle of bubbly in the fridge , but we \'ll leave it there till we \'ve finished this one . Now , Jeff , you           to hear all about what you and Lucilla have been up to . . . " Lucilla left them and obediently went in search of the wineglasses , stepping indoors through wide , curtained doors . The bar was immediately at hand , no more than a large closet fitted with everything that any human being could need to fix a drink . She took two wineglasses from the shelf but did not at once return to the terrace . This was the first time she had actually been inside Pandora \'s house , and she found herself in a room so spacious and spectacular that she was momentarily diverted from her errand . All was cool and creamy , sparked here and there with touches of brilliant colour . Sky-blue and turquoise cushions , and coralpink lilies massed in a square glass vase . Alcoves , cunningly lit , displayed a collection of Dresden figures and Battersea enamel . A plate-glass cof-fee-table was stacked with books and magazines , more flowers , a silver cigarette box . There was an open fireplace faced with blue-and-white tiles , and above           end of the room the dining-table--glass again -- was set for dinner with candles and crystal and yet more flowers , and to Lucilla \'s bemused eyes it all seemed more like a stage set than a room designed for living in . And yet , she realized , there were homely touches too . An open paperback sed onto a sofa ; a half-finished tapestry lying close at hand for an empty moment . And there were photographs . Archie and Isobel on their wedding day . Lucilla \'s grandparents , sweet old things in their tweeds , handing in front of Croy with their dogs beside them . Lucilla found these evidences of nostalgia immensely touching . For Some reason , she had not expected them , perhaps not imagining Pandora capable of such sentiment . Now she pictured Pandora taking them everywhere with her , all through her wayward love affairs and her turbulent nomad \'s life . Saw her unpacking them from her suitcase in houses in 184 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p184 California , hotel bedrooms , apartments in New York and Paris . And now ,           identity upon yet another temporary home . ( There did not seem to be any pictures of the men who had owned these apartments and occupied so much of Pandora \'s life , but perhaps she kept those in her bedroom . ) Warm dark breezes blew through the opened windows , and Rachmaninoff emanated from some unseen stereo , concealed by a gold-latticed trellis . The piano solo dripped its notes , pure as raindrops . From the terrace came the low murmur of comfortable conversation , Pandora and Jeff sounding peaceful and unimpatient . There were other photographs on the mantelpiece , and Lucilla crossed the floor to inspect these more closely . Old Lady Balmerino , resplendent in a feathered tam-o \' -shanter , apparently opening a village fete . A snapshot of Archie and Edmund Aird , two very young men sitting in the boat at the edge of the loch with their rods and their creels stowed on the thwarts . Finally , a studio portrait of herself and Hamish , Lucilla in smocked Liberty lawn and Hamish a fat baby on her knee .           of his letters and she had framed it in silver and set it in the place of honour . Tucked into this silver frame was an invitation whose format was instantly familiar . Pandora Blair Mrs. Angus Steynton At Home For Katy Lucilla \'s first thought was , how nice . And then , how ridiculous . A waste of a card , a waste of a stamp , because there was not the slightest possibility that Pandora would accept . She had gone from Croy when she was eighteen and never returned . Resisted all pleading , first from her parents , and then from her brother , and stayed resolutely away . It was scarcely likely that Verena Steynton , of all people , would achieve what Pandora \'s own family had so abjectly failed to do , " Lucilla ! " " Coming . . " What are you doing ? " p185 Lucilla , bearing the wineglasses , joined them on the terrace . " Sorry . I \'ve been snooping round that beautiful room . And listening to the mutic ... " " Oh ,           one of my most favourites . I know it \'s a bit hackneyed , but I seem to go for hackneyed things . " " I \'m just the same , " Lucilla admitted . " Songs like Oh , Lovely Moon \' nd The Barcarolle \' leave me quite weak-kneed . And some of the old atles records . I \'ve got them all at home at Croy . And if I \'m feeling ally blue , I \'ve got a tape of a Fiddlers \' Rally in Oban and I play it and I n feel my spirits rise visibly , like mercury in a thermometer when ou \'ve got a temperature . All those dear old men and little boys in their Its and their shirt-sleeves , and an endless round of jigs and reels , as ough they did n\'t know how to stop and did n\'t want to anyway . I sually end up dancing all by myself and leaping around the room like an lot . " Jeff said , " I \'ve never seen you do that . " " Well , if           But seriusly , Pandora , this is the most beautiful place you \'ve got . And our uest-house is perfection . " " It is rather sweet , is n\'t it ? I was so lucky to snap it all up . The people ho lived here before had to go back to England ; I was looking for mewhere to live and it seemed that it was just waiting for me . Jeff , ou \'re meant to be pouring champagne ... " " And the furniture ? Is that all yours too ? " Pandora laughed . " Oh , darling , I have n\'t got any furniture , just little is and pieces that I \'ve gathered on my travels and cart about with me , ost of the furniture here I took over with the house , but of course I \'ve anged almost everything . The sofas were the most hideous blue , and ere was a carpet with swirls on . Got rid of that pretty sharpish . I took raphina over with the house as well , and she \'s got a husband           on is a little doggie , but doggies in ajorca are inclined to get shot by youths with airguns , or else they get ks , or they get stolen , or run over . So there \'s not really much point . " ll the glasses were now brimming full . Pandora raised hers . " Here \'s to you both , and what heaven it is to have you here . Lucilla , s been telling me all about your journey down through France . How cinating it must have been . And you got to see Chartres , such an perience . I \'m longing to hear more , get all the details ; but first , and ost important , I want to be told all about home , and my precious chie and Isobel and Hamish . Hamish must be enormous now . And 186 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p186 Isobel , with those tedious Americans to stay . I hear all about them in Archie \'s letters , when he is n\'t telling me about the latest grouse-bag , or the size of the salmon he           able to do so much with that terrible leg . Tell me how the poor leg is . " " He ca n\'t actually do that much , " Lucilla told her bluntly . " He just writes you positive letters because he does n\'t want you to be upset . And his leg is n\'t anything . It \'s tin , full stop . It ca n\'t get any better , and we all pray it \'ll never get any worse . " " Poor darling . Beastly , beastly IRA . How they dare to do such things , and to Archie , of all people . " " They were n\'t necessarily gunning for him , Pandora . They were wait . ing , over the border , to blast off at a lot of British jocks , and he happened to be one of them . " " Did he know they were there ? Or was it an ambush ? " " I do n\'t know . And if I asked , he would n\'t tell me . He wo n\'t talk about it .           " Is that a good thing ? " " I do n\'t suppose it is , but there \'s not much we can do about it . " " He was never a great talker . The most darling man , but even as a , little boy he always kept everything to himself . We never even knew ht was courting Isobel , and when he told our mother that he wanted t marry her , Mama nearly dropped dead with astonishment because she \' got him lined up for some entirely different female . Never mind , sh made the best of it . Just as she always made the best of everything . . . Her voice faded . She fell silent , then swiftly emptied her glass . " Jeff , there any more left in that bottle , or shall we open another ? " But the bottle was not yet empty and Jeff refilled Pandora \'s glass , an then topped up Lucilla \'s and his own . Lucilla was now beginning to f not only light-hearted but light-headed as well . She wondered           . Perhaps the champagne was why she seemed to be talking so much . " Now tell me . . " She was off again . " What are the two of you going to do next ? " Jeff and Lucilla looked at each other . Making plans was not one a ! their strong points . Doing things on the spur of the moment was half the fun . It was Jeff who replied . " We do n\'t really know . Only thing is , I have go back to Australia at the beginning of October . I \'ve a flight book with Qantas on the third . " " Where do you fly from ? " " London . " p187 " So , sometime , you \'ll have to go back to England . " " Right . " " Is Lucilla going with you ? " Again they looked at each other . " We have n\'t discussed it , " Lucilla said . " So you \'re free . Free as air . Free to come and go as you wish . The           gesture with her hand and illed some of her champagne . " Yes , " Jeff agreed cautiously , " I suppose it is . " " Then let us make plans . Lucilla , would you like to make plans with e ? " " What sort of plans ? " " When you were snooping , as you put it , around my drawing-room , id you notice that large and pretentious copperplate invitation on my mantelpiece ? " " From Verena Steynton ? Yes , I did . " " Have you been asked ? " " Yes . Dad sent my invitation on to me and I got it in Ibiza . " " Are you going ? " " I . . . I had n\'t actually thought about it . " " Might you go ? " " I do n\'t know . Why ? " " Because ... " She laid down her glass . " I think that I shall go . " The shock of this announcement stunned Lucilla out of her delightful siness and into a state of cold sobriety           Pandora stared back , her grey eyes with their huge black pils bright with a strange elation , as though delighting in the expressio-n of blank incredulity she had brought to Lucilla \'s face . " You \'d go ? " " Why not ? " " Back to Scotland ? " " Where else ? " " For Verena Steynton \'s dance ? " It did not make sense . " It \'s as good a reason as any " " But you \'ve never come before . Dad asked you and begged you , and \' ve never come . He told me . " " There has to be a first time . Perhaps now is the right time . " All at e she stood up and walked away from them to stand looking out over garden . She stayed there for an instant , quite still , silhouetted against light that shone upwards from the pool . Her dress , her hair moved in breeze . Then she turned to face them , leaning against the balustrade . P p188 She said , and she           \'ve been thinking so much about Croy . Just lately , I \'ve been thinking so much about it . I \'d dream about it , and wake up , and start remembering things I had n\'t thought of in years . And then the invitation came . Like yours , Lucilla , forwarded on from Croy . And it brought back a million memories of the fun we used to have at those ridiculous dances and hunt balls . And house parties , and the hills ringing with the crack of guns , and every evening an enormous dinner party . How my poor mother coped with us all , I can not imagine . " She smiled at Lucilla , and then at Jeff . " And you two arriving . Phoning from Palma and turning up out of the blue , and Lucilla so like Archie . Omens . Do you believe in omens , Lucilla ? " " I do n\'t know . " " Neither do I. But I \'m certain , with the Highland blood that courses through our veins , that we should           on the foot-rest , her face close to Lucilla \'s . Beneath the beauty , Lucilla could discern the years stamped on Pandora \'s lovely features : the lines around her eyes and mouth , the papery skin , the sharp angle of her jawbone . " So , let us make plans . Will you both make plans with me ? Would you mind if I asked you to do that thing ? " Lucilla looked across at Jeff . He shook his head . She said , " We would n\'t mind . " " Then this is what we \'ll do . We \'ll stay here for a week , just the three of us , and you shall have the time of your lives . And then we \'ll take my car , and we \'ll catch the ferry to Spain . And we \'ll drive through Spain and France , taking our time and making a pleasure of the journey . When we get to Calais , we \'ll cross over to England . And we \'ll head north , and we \'ll go to           Croy . Oh , Lucilla , say you think it \'s a wonderful idea . " " It \'s certainly totally unexpected , " was all Lucilla could come up with , but if Pandora noticed a certain lack of enthusiasm in her voice , she gave no indication of doing so . Swept along on her own excitement , she turned to Jeff . " And you ? How does it sound to you ? Or do you think I \'m out o ( ? my mind ? " " No . " " You would n\'t mind coming to Scotland with us ? " " If that \'s what you and Lucilla want , I \'d be delighted . " " Then it \'s all settled ! " She was triumphant . " We \'ll all stay at Croy with Isobel and Archie , and we \'ll all go to the Steyntons \' lovely party . " " But Jeff has n\'t been asked , " Lucilla pointed out . " Oh , that \'s no problem . " " And he wo n\'t have anything to wear           , you do disappoint me . I thought you were an unworldly artist , and all you seem to do is worry bout clothes ! Do n\'t you see , clothes do n\'t matter . Nothing matters . The my thing that matters is that we \'re going back home , together . Just ink what fun we \'re going to have . And now we must celebrate ! " She rang to her feet . " The perfect moment to open that second bottle of ampagne ! " p193 Thursday the Eighth ISOBEL BALMERINO , AT HER SEWING-MACHINE , stitched the last me-tape , HAMISH BLAIR , onto the last new handkerchief , cut the read , folded the handkerchief , and laid it on top of the pile of clothes at stood on the table beside her . All done . All that remained were those rments which required that the name-tapes be hand-sewn ... rugger ckings , an overcoat , and a grey polo-necked pullover , but these could done at leisure , in the evening , and by the fireside . She had not had such           four years ago , but he had grown during the summer lidays to such an alarming extent that she had been forced to wheel into Relkirk , school-clothes list in hand , and start all over again . The pedition , as she had known it would be , had been both painful and pensive . Painful because Hamish did not want to think about going k to school , hated shopping , hated new clothes , and miserably reted being done out of a single day of his holiday freedom . And expen-e because the regulation uniform could only be purchased at the most market and costly shop in the town . The overcoat , the polo-necked ter , and the rugger stockings were bad enough , but five new pairs of rmous leather shoes were almost more than Isobel , and her bank ance , could take . With some idea of cheering Hamish up , she had bought him an icem , but he had devoured this morosely and without joy , and they had urned to Croy in an uncommunicative and mutually unfriendly si- . Once           his trout rod , and wearing an expression which implied that he had grossly mistreated . Isobel was left to hump the parcels and boxes airs , where she had slung them into the foot of his wardrobe and 194 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p194 firmly shut the door , then made her way to the kitchen to boil a kettle for a cup of tea and start preparing dinner . The horrible experience of spending vast quantities of money that she could not afford left her feeling quite sick , and Hamish \'s patent ingratitude did not help . Peeling potatoes , she said a silent goodbye to an dreams of buying herself a new dress for the Steyntons \' dance . The of . navy taffeta would have to do . Letting herself feel martyred and ill don by , she toyed with the notion of freshening it up with a touch of white : the neck . But that had all happened two weeks ago , and now September here . That made everything better , and for a number of reasons . most important was that , until           of paying guests . Scottish Country Tours had shut up shop for t winter , and the last lot of Americans , complete with baggage , souveni and tartan bonnets , had been waved away . The tiredness and depressi that had dogged Isobel all summer was dissolved almost instantly by h sense of freedom and the knowledge that , once more , she and Archie h Croy to themselves . But this was not all . Born and bred in Scotland , she experienced e. year this lifting of the spirits as August slipped away , off the calen , : and one could stop pretending that it was summer . Some years , it true , there came seasons like the old days , when the lawns grew dry fr \' lack of rain and golden evenings were spent watering the roses and sw - peas and the rows of young lettuces in the vegetable garden . But t frequently the months of June , July , and August were nothing but a lo and soggy endurance test of frustration and disappointment . Grey ski chill winds ,           saint . The worst were those dark and muggy days when , in desperate one eventually retreated indoors and lit a fire , whereupon the sky instantly cleared and the late afternoon sun dazzled out over the sod ? garden , tantalizingly too late to be of use to anybody . This summer , in particular , had been specially disappointing , and wi hindsight Isobel realized that the weeks of dark clouds and sunlessned had done much to contribute to her low spirits and physical exhaust \' The first snap of frost was actually welcome , and she was able to p195 away her cotton skirts and shirts with some satisfaction and revert once more to friendly old tweeds and Shetland pullovers . But even after splendid summers , September in Relkirkshire was special . Those first light frosts cleared the air , so that the colours of the countryside took on a stronger and richer hue . The deep blue of the skies was reflected in loch and river , and with the harvest safely in , the fields tood golden with stubble . Harebells grew in wayside           bloom , stained the hills with purple . And then , most important of all , September meant fun . A packed ason of socializing before the darkness of a long winter closed in on em all , when the bitter weather and snow-packed roads isolated scatred communities and precluded any form of contact . September meant ople . Friends . For this was when Relkirkshire came truly into its own . By the end of July , the last of the annual invasion of holiday-makers d , by and large , left ; tents were packed up and caravans towed away , as e tourists headed for home . In their stead , August brought the vanard of a secondary immigration from the south , regular visitors who turned each year to Scotland for the sport and the parties . Shooting ges that had stood forlornly empty for most of the year were once ore opened up , and their owners , driving north up the motorway in nge Rovers loaded to the gunwales with rods , guns , small children , nagers , friends , relations , and           , local households swelled , not with Americans nor paying gists but with the young families who belonged to these establishments d had , by necessity , moved south to London to live and work , saving cir yearly vacations to return home at just this time . All bedrooms were upied , attics turned into temporary accommodation for gangs of ndchildren , and sparse bathrooms worked overtime . Huge quantities food were produced , cooked , and eaten every day at dining-room ta-s elongated by extra leaves . And then , September . In September , all at once , everything came to , as though some celestial stage-manager had made his countdown d pulled the switch . The Station Hotel in Relkirk was transformed m its customary Victorian gloom to a cheerful , crowded meeting-place old friends , and the Strathcroy Arms , taken over by the syndicate of sinessmen who paid Archie reassuring sums of money for the privilege shooting grouse over his moor , fairly buzzed with activity and sporting At Croy , \' the invitations stood stacked on the mantelpiece in the liry , and           ROSAMUNDE FILCHER p196 tion to the general jollity was an annual buffet lunch party before the Strathcroy Games . Archie was Chieftain of these Games and led the opening parade of village worthies , their stride tactfully slowed to match his halting gait . For this important ceremony , he wore his regimental balmoral and carried a drawn sword . He took his responsibilities with great solemnity and , at the end of the day , presented prizes , not only for piping and Highland dancing but also for the sweater most expertly knitted from hand-spun wool , the lightest of sponge cakes , and the winning pot of home-made strawberry jam . Isobel kept her sewing-machine in the old linen room at Croy , mostly for reasons of convenience but also because it was her favourite and most private retreat . Not large , but quite spacious enough , it had windows facing west , out over the croquet lawn and the road that led up to the loch , and on bright days was always filled with sunshine . The curtains were white cotton , the floor brown           cupboards in which were stowed all the household sheets and towels and spare blankets and fresh bed-covers . The solid table on which stood the sewing-machine was also useful for cutting out and dressmaking , and the ironing-board and the iron stood ready for instant use . As well , there was always a comforting nursery smell of laundered linen and the lavender bags that Isobel tucked in with her crisp piles of pillowcases , and this contributed in no small way to create an extraordinary aura of timelessness and tranquillity . Which was why , with the name-tapes finished , she made no immediate effort to move but stayed , sitting on the hard chair , with her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands . The view beyond the open window led , up beyond the trees , to the first gentle summits of the hills . All was washed in golden sunlight . The curtains stirred in the breeze , and that same breath of air shivered through the branches of the silver birches that stood on the far side of the lawn .           It was half past three and she was alone in the house . Indoors all was still , but from the farmyard she heard distant hammering and the barking of one of the dogs . For once in her life she had time to herself , there being no commitment nor person urgently requiring her attention . She could scarcely remember when she had last found herself in such a situation , p197 197 and her thoughts drifted back to childhood and youth and the lazy , aimless joys of empty days . A floor creaked . Somewhere a door slammed shut . Croy . An old house with a heartbeat all its own . Her home . But she remembered the day , over twenty years ago , when Archie had first brought her here . She was nineteen and a tennis party had been arranged , with afternoon tea served in the dining-room . Isobel , the daughter of an Angus solicitor , and neither beautiful nor assured , had found herself overwhelmed by the size and grandeur of the place , and as well by the glamour           whom seemed to know each other frighteningly well . Already hopelessly in love with Archie , she could not imagine why he had bothered to include her in the general invitation . Lady Balmerino appeared to be equally perplexed , but had been kind , making certain Isobel sat next to her at the tea-table , and taking pains to see that she was not left out of any conversation . But there was another girl , long-legged and blonde , who seemed already to have claimed Archie for her own , and made this very clear to e assembled company , teasing him , and catching his eye across the ble as though they shared a million private secrets . Archie , she was ! ling them all , belonged to her , and no other person would be permitted take possession . But , at the end of the day , Archie had made up his own mind to marry Sobel . His parents , once they had got over their astonishment , were tently delighted and welcomed Isobel into the family not as Archie \'s ife but           funny , hospitale , unworldly , and totally charming , the Balmerinos were adored by erybody and Isobel was no exception . From the farm , she heard one of the tractors starting up . Another leaf uttered to the ground . It occurred to Isobel that now could be an after-n that had happened long ago , as though time had slipped backwards . e sort of afternoon when dogs sought for shade , and cats basked on ndow-sills , their furry bellies turned to the sun . She thought of Mrs. Harris , with one of the younger maids in tow , emerging from the kitchen d headed for the walled garden , there to fill a bowl with the last of the pberries , or reach for the bloomy Victoria plums , capturing their eetness before the wasps got at them . A11 of Croy the way it once had been . Nobody had gone away . Nobody died . They were still alive , those two dear old people ; Archie \'s ther out with her roses , snipping away at the dead heads and finding           raked the dusty gravel ; Archie \'s father in the library , stealing a little snooze with his silk 198 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p198 handkerchief spread across his face . Isobel only had to go and find them . She imagined doing this , making her way down the stairs , crossing the hall to stand at the open front door . She saw Lady Balmerino in her straw gardening hat coming in from the garden , carrying the basket filled with snippings and faded rose petals . But when she looked up and saw Isobel , she would frown and show some confusion because the middleaged Isobel would be unfamiliar to her as a ghost ... . " Isobel ! " The voice , raised , impinged upon her daydreams . Isobel was aware that it had already called , more than once , but she had scarcely heard . Who was wanting her now ? Reluctantly she collected herself , push back the chair and got to her feet . Perhaps to be left alone for more th five minutes was too much to expect . She went out           head of the stairs . Leaning over the bannister she saw below her the foreshortened view of Verena Steynton standing the middle of the hall , having walked into the house through the o front door . " Isobel ! " " I \'m here . " Verena tilted her head and looked up . " I was beginning to think th was nobody in . " " Only me . " Isobel started down the stairs . " Archie \'s taken Hami and the dogs to the Buchanan-Wrights \' cricket match . " " Are you busy ? " Verena did not look as though she had been busy . usual , she was immaculately and suitably turned out , and surely had just been to the hairdresser . " I \'ve been sewing Hamish \'s name-tapes for school . " Instinctively , Isobel put a hand to her hair , as though the casual gesture might improve her own tousled head . " But I \'ve finished now . " " Can you spare me a moment ? " " Of course . " " I \'ve got           I meant to phone b I \'ve been in Relkirk all day and then , driving home , I thought it much simpler and nicer just to call in . " " Do you want a cup of tea ? " " In a moment . No hurry . " " Let \'s go and be comfortable . " Isobel led her visitor into the drawingroom , not with any intentions of grandeur but simply because it was full of sunlight , and the library and the kitchen , at this time of day , were inclined to be gloomy . The windows stood open , the room felt cool , and a p199 mass of sweet peas , which Isobel had picked that morning and arranged in an old soup tureen , filled the air with their fragrance . " Heaven . " Verena sank into a corner of the sofa and stretched out her long and elegantly shod legs . " What a day for the cricket match . Last year it bucketed with rain and they had to pull stumps in the middle of the afternoon because           peas ? What colours ! Mine were a bit of a failure this year . Do you know I really hate Relkirk on a warm afternoon ? The pavements were banked three deep with fat girls in jeans pushing babies in buggies . And all the babies seemed to be howling . " " I know the feeling . How \'s everything going ? " She had already made up her mind that Verena wanted to talk about the dance and she was not mistaken . " Oh . . . " Verena , for a moment , became quite dramatic , groaning as though in pain and closing her eyes . " I \'m beginning to wonder why I ever thought about throwing a party . Do you know half the invitations have n\'t even been answered yet ? People are so thoughtless . I think they leave them curling on mantelpieces , waiting to die of old age . It makes trying to arrange dinner parties and find beds for everybody quite impos-ible . " " I would n\'t worry . " Isobel tried to sound soothing .           " " But that would mean utter chaos . " Isobel knew that it would n\'t , but Verena was a perfectionist . " Yes , I uppose so . It must be awful . " She added , almost afraid to ask , " Has Lucilla replied yet ? " " No , " Verena told her bluntly . " We did send your invitation on , but she \'s travelling so she may not en have got it . She sent us a rather vague address in Ibiza , but we ve n\'t heard from her since she was in Paris . She thought she might go d see Pandora . " " I have n\'t heard from Pandora either . " " I \'ll be surprised if you do . She never answers anything . " " But Alexa Aird \'s coming , and bringing a boyfriend . Did you know at Alexa has found herself a man ? " " Vi told me . " " Extraordinary . I wonder what he \'s like . " " Virginia says he \'s dishy . " " Ca           Katy arriving ? " " Next week sometime . She called last night . Which is one of the 200 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p200 favours that I have to ask you . Have you got a houseful of people staying over the dance ? " " So far , nobody . Hamish will be back at school and I do n\'t know whether Lucilla will be here or not .... " " Well , could you be an angel and have a stray man to stay ? Katy told me about him last night . She met him at some dinner party , and liked him . He \'s an American -- a lawyer , I think -- but his wife \'s just died , and he \'s come over here for a bit of a holiday . He \'s coming to Scotland anyway to stay with some people who live in the Borders , and she thought it would be friendly to send him an invitation . We ca n\'t put him up at Corriehill because I \'m full , with all Katy \'s friends , and Toddy Buchanan has           I thought you could give him a bed ? Would you mind ? I do n\'t know anything abou him except the bit about his wife dying , but if Katy liked him I don suppose he \'d be dreadfully heavy weather . " " Poor man . Of course he can come . " " And you \'ll bring him to the party ? You are sweet . I \'ll ring Katy tonight , and tell her to tell him to get in touch with you . " " What \'s his name ? " " Something funny . Plucker . Or ... Tucker . That \'s it . Conr Tucker . Why do you suppose Americans always have such peculi names ? " Isobel laughed . " They probably think Balmerino \'s pretty odd . Wh else is happening ? " " Nothing really . We \'ve persuaded Toddy Buchanan to do the cateri and run the bar , and produce some sort of a breakfast . For some reaso Katy \'s generation are always ravenously hungry around four in t morning . And darling Tom Drystone is           n\'t be a party without our whistling postman up on t platform . Are you having a disco ? " " Yes . A young man from Relkirk is doing that . He produces every thing . A sort of job lot . Flashing lights and amplifiers . What the noise going to be like , I dread to think . And we \'re going to have fairy lights the way up the drive . I thought it would look festive , and if it \'s a miser ably dark evening , it \'ll help people find the way . " " It \'ll look wonderful . You \'ve thought of everything . " " Except flowers . That \'s the other favour I \'ve got to ask you . Wou you help with the flowers ? Katy will be there , and I \'ve press-ganged o or two others , but nobody does flowers the way you do , and I \'d endlessly grateful if you \'d help . " p201 Isobel felt flattered . It was nice to think that there was something that could do better than           thing is , " Verena went on before Isobel had a chance to speak , " I \' t think how to decorate the marquee . The house is n\'t so difficult , but marquee presents something of a problem because it \'s so enormous d ordinary flower arrangements would simply be dwarfed . What do u think ? You \'re always full of bright ideas . " Isobel searched for a bright idea but drew a blank . " Hydrangeas ? " " They \'ll be over by then . " " Hire some potted palms . " " Too depressing . Like the ballroom of some provincial hotel . " " Well , why not make it really countrified and seasonal ? Sheaves of ripe ley and branches of rowan . Lovely red berries and those pretty leaves . d the beeches will be turning as well . We can soak the stems in glycerand simply cover the tent-poles , make them look like autumn s . " " Oh , a brainwave . You \'re brilliant . We \'ll do it all the day before the y           your diary ? " " It \'s Vi \'s birthday picnic that day , but I can give that a miss . " " You \'re a saint . What a weight off my mind . The relief of it . " Verena tched luxuriously , swallowed a yawn , fell silent . The clock on the mantelpiece ticked gently , and the quiet of the room ed in on the two women . Yawns were catching . And it was a mistake er to sit down in the middle of the afternoon because you did n\'t feel ever getting up again . Summer afternoons and nothing in particular do . Once more Isobel drifted back into that illusion of timelessness in ich she had been lost before Verena \'s interruption . She thought again old Lady Balmerino , who used to sit here , as she and Verena sat , ding a novel or peacefully sewing her tapestry . Everything now as e it had been . Perhaps in a moment there would come a discreet tap the door and Harris the butler would enter , pushing before him           eggshell china cups ; covered dishes of scones , fresh from the oven , the bowl of cream , the wberry jam , the lemon sponge-cake , and the dark , sticky gingerbread . The clock , with silvery notes , struck four , and the illusion dissolved . rris was long gone and would never return . Isobel yawned again and , with some effort , pulled herself to her feet . " I \'ll go and put the tle on , " she told Verena , " and we \'ll have that cup of tea . " p202 Friday the Ninth . . THAT WAS THE YEAR my cousin Flora had her bairn . Did yo know her parents ? Uncle Hector was my father \'s brother , much younger of course , and married to a girl from Rum . Met her when he was policeman ; she was always a shiftless creature , lost all her teeth when sh was scarcely out of her twenties .

Pi silk with a fern pattern , but she put it in the boiler with the sheets , it j about broke my heart .... " Violet stopped listening . It did n\'t seem necessary to listen . One j nodded , or said " Oh , yes , " every time Lottie paused for breath , and th she was away again on some other confusing tack . " ... went into service when I was fourteen , over in a big house Fife ; I cried buckets , but my mother said I had to go . I was the kitch maid and the Cook was a bisom ; I \'ve never been so tired in my life , up five o\'clock in the morning and slept in the attic with a moose . " This at least caught Violet \'s attention . " A moose , Lottie ? " " I think it was a moose . One of those stuffed heads . On the wall . T big for a stag . Mr. Gilfillan had been in Africa           missionary would have gone round killi mooses , would you ? Christmas they had roast goose , but all I got was bit of cold mutton . Mean . Would n\'t give you the drippings off their no The attic was that damp , my clothes were wringing wet , caught pneum nia . The doctor came , Mrs. Gilfillan sent me home , never been so glad get back . Had a cat at home . Tammy Puss . He was that quick . Open t larder door and in with the cream ; once we found a dead mouse in t cream . And Ginger had a litter of kittens , half-wild , scratched the skit 4 p203 my mother \'s hands , she was never good with animals . Hated my ther \'s dog .... " They sat , the two elderly ladies , on a bench in the big park in Relkirk. fore them , the river flowed , heavy with flood-water and stained brown ith peat . A fisherman , up to his hips in water , flogged his salmon rod . far he did           . Across the river ood large Victorian houses , deep in spacious gardens with lawns that n down to the water . One or two had little boats moored . There were ucks on the water . A man , passing with his dog , threw crusts and the ucks came gobbling , squabbling , to snatch the crusts up . ... the doctor said it was a stroke , said she \'d got nerves . I wanted to and be a volunteer , with the war on and everything , but if I \'d gone ere \'d be no one to stay with my mother . My father was a worker out of ors , he grew lovely turnips , but indoors , sit down and take off his boots d that was it . . . never seen a man who could eat so much . \' He was ver a talker , some days never said a word . Trapped rabbits . Ate a lot of bbits , we did . Course that was before mixamy-toasties . Filthy things Violet , having made her promise to Henry           an afternoon , had suffered an uneasy conscience until e had finally decided to take the plunge and get it over , and had invited tie to come shopping with her in Relkirk and to have high tea . She ad duly collected Lottie from Edie \'s cottage , packed her into the car , nd driven her into the town . For the occasion Lottie had dressed in her st , a beige Crimplene coat and a hat the shape of a cottage loaf . She rried a huge handbag and wore her tottery high-heeled shoes . From the oment she got into the car , she had not stopped talking . She had talked they made their way around Marks and Spencer , talked as they waited the queue to buy fresh vegetables , talked as they searched the crowded reets for what Lottie insisted on calling a haberdasher \'s . " I do n\'t think there are any haberdasher \'s any longer , Lottie . . . . " " Oh , yes , a little one down that street . . . or was it the           " Never believing they would find it , Violet allowed herself to be led and in circles , getting more hot and footsore by the moment , and was rn between annoyance and relief when Lottie finally ran the shop to rth . It was very old and dusty , and crammed with a collection of rdboard boxes containing crochet hooks , faded embroidery silks , and t-of-date knitting patterns . The old woman behind the counter looked though she had just managed to make it out of a geriatric home , and it k her fifteen minutes to find what Lottie wanted , which was a yard of 204 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p204 boiling knicker elastic . Finally , however , it was produced from a drawer filled with odd buttons , put shakily into a paper bag , and paid for . They stepped out onto the pavement , and Lottie was triumphant . " Told you so , " she crowed to Violet . " Did n\'t believe me , did you ? " With their shopping over and it not yet being time for tea , Violet           made their way back to her car , dumped their purchases in the boot , and then crossed the wide sward of grass that led to the river . At the first bench , Violet had firmly sat down . " We \'ll have a little rest , " she told Lottie , and so here they were , side by side in the golden sunshine , and Lottie still with plenty to say . " That \'s the Relkirk Royal , that \'s where I was , you can just see it through the trees . Nice enough place , but I could n\'t stand the nurses . The doctor was good enough , but no more than a young student , do n\'t imagine he knew anything , although he pretended he did . Lovely gardens , though , just as nice as the Cremmy . I wanted Mother cremated , but the minister said she wanted to lie by my father in the churchyard at Tullochard . Though I do n\'t know how he should know more than me . " " I expect your mother told           , always liked to interfere . " Violet looked across the river to where the Relkirk Royal stood hi on the hill , its red stone turrets and gables scarcely visible through th leafy trees that surrounded it . She said , " The hospital certainly has lovely position . " " That \'s doctors for you . They can pay for anything . " Casually , " What was he called , the young doctor who took care you ? " " Dr. Martin . There was another , Dr. Faulkner , but he never came n me . It was Dr. Martin who said I could go and live with Edie . I wanted taxi but it was an ambulance . " " Edie is very kind . " " She \'s had a good enough life , some people have all the luck . Different living in a village to being stuck away up the hill . " " Perhaps you could sell your parents \' house and move into a village ? " But Lottie ignored this sensible suggestion and went on , full flood ,           to Violet then that Lottis \' was more astute than any of them suspected . " Worry about her being so fat , it \'s a heart attack she \'ll have one morning , carrying all that flab around with her . And always flying out of the house , off to your house Virginia \'s , never sits down for a bit of peace or a chat or to watch t telly . Ought to think of herself sometimes . She told me that Alexa \' coming up for Mrs. Steynton \'s party . Bringing a friend . That \'s nice , isn p205 It ? But you \'ll need to watch , men are all the same , after what they can get their hands on .. .. " " What do you mean , Lottie ? " Violet was sharp . Lottie turned dark round eyes upon her . " Well , she \'s no pauper , is Alexa . Old Lady Cheriton was never short of sixpence . I read the newspapers , know all about that family . Nothing like a bit of cash to           Violet found herself assailed by a helpless rage that seemed to surge up from the soles of her feet and , reaching her cheeks , burn them red . Rage at Lottie \'s impertinence , and helplessness because Lottie was , after all , only voicing what all Alexa \'s family , obscurely , feared . She said , " Alexa is very pretty and very dear . The fact that she is also independent has nothing to do with the friends she chooses . " But Lottie either ignored or missed the snub . She gave a little laugh , tossing her head . " I would n\'t be too sure about that . And coming from London , too . Lot of money grubbers . Yuppies , " she added with some force , saying the word as though it were dirty . " Lottie , I do n\'t think you know what you \'re talking about . " " All these girls are the same . Always were , see a handsome man and they \'re away like a bitch in heat . " She shivered suddenly           every nerve-end of her gangling ame . Then she put out a hand and closed it over Violet \'s wrist . " That \'s another thing . Henry . See him about the place . He \'s small , is n\'t he ? Comes to Edie \'s and never says a word . Looks funny to me sometimes . I \'d worry if I were you . Not like other little boys ... " Her bony fingers were strangely strong , the grip viselike . Violet , re-I led , knew an instant of panic . Her immediate instinct was to prize the ngers loose , get to her feet and escape , but just then a girl walked by ushing a child in a buggy , and common sense came to Violet \'s rescue . re panic , the annoyance faded . It was , after all , just poor Lottie Carirs , to whom life had not been kind , letting her sad , sexual frustrations d her rambling imagination run away with her . And if Edie could nd having her cousin to live with her ,           smiled . She said , " It \'s good of you to be concerned , Lottie , but my is a very ordinary little boy and sound as a bell . Now . . . " She fted slightly , glancing at her watch , and felt Lottie \'s fingers loosen r manic grip and slip away . Violet , unhurried , reached for her hand- .. I think it \'s time we went and found somewhere pleasant to have our tea . I \'m feeling quite peckish . I fancy fish and chips . How about p206 AS ISOBEL , WORN OUT WITH the daily demands of her busy life , retreated from time to time to the linen room , so her husband found solace in his workshop . This was in the basement of Croy , an area of stone-flagged passages and dimly lighted cellars . The old boiler lived down here , a brooding , smelly monster that looked large enough to drive a liner , and demanded constant and regular attention and enormous quantities of coke . As well , one or two other rooms           items of furniture , the coal and the logs , and a much-diminished wine cellar . But mostly , the basement stood deserted , hung with cobwebs and invaded each year by families of field mice . The workshop was next door to the boiler room , which meant that it was always pleasantly warm , and it had large windows , barred like a jail \'s , which faced south and west and let in sufficient light for cheerfulness . Archie \'s father , neat with his hands , had set it all up , with heavy benches , racks for tools , vises , and clamps . And it was here that the old man had liked to potter , repairing his children \'s damaged toys , dealing with various inevitable breakages that occurred about the house , and concocting his own salmon flies . After he died , the workshop had stood empty for some years , unused , neglected , and gathering dust . But when Archie came back to Croy after his eight months in hospital , he painfully made his way down the stone           and took repossession . The first thing he saw as he entered the room was a broken balloon-back chair , its back legs shattered by the weight of some corpulent occupant . It had been brought down to the workshop before old Lord Balmerino died . He had made a start on its repair but never finished the job , and the chair had been left , forgotten and untended , ever since . Archie stood and looked at the forlorn piece of furniture for some p207 time . Then he shouted for Isobel . She came . She helped him sweep away the dirt and the cobwebs and the mouse droppings and the drifts of old sawdust . Scuttling spiders were sent packing , as were solidified pots of glue , piles of yellowed newspapers , ancient tins of paint . Isobel cleaned the windows and somehow forced them open , letting in the sweet fresh air . Meanwhile Archie , having wiped and oiled all the fine old tools , the chisels and hammers , saws and planes , replaced them in orderly fashion in their racks .           a list of all that he needed , and Isobel went into Relkirk and bought it for him . Only then was he able to get down to work and finish the job that his father had started . Now he sat at that same bench , the afternoon sun slanting through the top half of the window , and finished priming the carving he had been working on , from time to time , over the last month or two . It was about ten inches high and depicted the figure of a girl sitting on a boulder with a small Jack Russell terrier leaning against her knee . The girl wore a sweater and a kilted skirt , and her hair was windblown . It was , in fact , Katy Steynton and her dog . Verena had given Archie a photograph of her daughter , taken up on the moor last year , and from this he had made the drawings for the carving . With the primer dry , he would paint it , reproducing as closely as possible the muted colours of the photograph .           twenty-first birthday present . It was done . He laid down the brush and leaned back in his chair to stretch the aches out of his limbs , and assess his creation over the top of his half-moon spectacles . He had never before attempted the complications of a sitting figure , and a female one at that , and was inordinately pleased with the way it had turned out . Girl and dog made a charming composition . Tomorrow he would paint it . He looked forward with some satisfaction to applying the final touches . From upstairs , he heard the faint sound of the telephone ringing . It was only just audible , and for months he and Isobel had been talking about the sense of installing another bell in the basement so that he could hear the sound more easily , should he be alone in the hbuse . But they had done nothing about this and he was alone in the house now , and wondered how long the telephone had been ringing , and if there was time for 208 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p208 him           before the caller , losing heart , hung up . He thought about ignoring it but the ringing continued . Perhaps it was important . He pushed back his chair and made his slow way down the passage and up the stairs to answer the wretched instrument . The nearest receiver was in the kitchen and it was still ringing shrilly as Archie crossed over to the dresser and picked it up . " Croy . " " Dad ! " " Lucilla ! " His heart leaped with joy . He reached for a chair . " Where were you ? The phone \'s been ringing for hours . " " Down in my workshop . " He settled himself \' , taking the weight off his leg . " Oh , I \'m sorry . Is Mum not there ? " " No . She and Hamish have gone blackberrying . Lucilla , where are you ? " " I \'m in London . And you \'ll never guess where I \'m ringing from . You \'ll never guess in a thousand years . " " In that           Ritz . " " What the hell are you doing there ? " " Staying the night . And then we \'re driving up tomorrow . We \'ll be home tomorrow night . " Archie took off his spectacles ; he could feel the grin of delight spreading over his face . " Who \'s we \' ? " " Jeff Howland and me . And .. . wait for it . . Pandora . " " Pandora ? " " I thought that would surprise you . . . . " " But what \'s Pandora doing with you ? " " She \'s coming home . She says it \'s for Verena Steynton \'s dance , but I suspect it \'s really to see Croy and all of you again . " " Is she there now ? " " No . She \'s having a toes-up . I \'m phoning from my room . I \'m all alone except for Jeff . I \'ve got so much to tell you and Mum , but I wo n\'t do it now because it \'s all so complicated ...           . " When did you get to London ? " " This morning . Just before lunch . We \'ve all been driving through Spain and France in Pandora \'s car . We \'ve had the most amazing time . Then we caught the ferry early this morning and came to London . I was all ready to head north right away , but Pandora wanted to draw breath , so she brought us here . Insisted . And do n\'t worry about the bill because p209 she \'s footing it . She footed the whole trip , ever since we left Palma . Paid for all the petrol , the hotels , everything . " " How , . . " His voice broke . It was ridiculous , unmanly , to be so emotional . He tried again . " How is she ? " " She \'s fine . Terribly pretty . Lots of fun . Oh , Dad , you are pleased I \'m bringing her home , are n\'t you ? It \'s not going to be too much for Mum ? Pandora \'s not           she \'ll ever raise a finger to do anything to help , but she \'s so excited about seeing you both again . It will be all right , wo n\'t it ? " " More than all right , my darling . It \'s like a miracle . " " And do n\'t forget , I \'m bringing Jeff as well . " " We look forward to meeting him . " " See you tomorrow then . " " What time ? " " About five ? But do n\'t worry if we \'re a little late . " " We wo n\'t . " " I ca n\'t wait . " " Nor me . Drive carefully , my darling . " " Of course . " She sent him a kissing noise down the hundreds of miles of wire , and rang off . Archie was left sitting on the hard kitchen chair and holding the buzzing receiver in his hand . Lucilla and Pandora . Coming home . He replaced the receiver . The buzzing ceased . The old kitchen clock ticked slowly . For           then got to his feet and went out of the kitchen and down the passage to his study . Sitting at his desk , he opened a drawer and took out a key . Using this key , he opened another , smaller drawer . From this he withdrew an envelope , yellowed with the years and addressed in Pandora \'s large and immature scrawl to himself , at the Headquarters of The Queen \'s Loyal Highlanders , in Berlin . The date of the postmark was 1967 . It contained a letter , but he did not take this letter out to read because he knew it by heart . Which meant that there was no reason why he had never torn it to shreds , nor flung it on a fire , except that he could not bring himself to destroy it . Pandora . Coming back to Croy . From the distance came the sound of a car , growing louder , approaching the house , up the hill from the main road . The noise of its engine was unmistakable . Isobel and Hamish returning in           envelope back into its drawer , locked it away , disposed once more of the key , and went to meet them . 210 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p210 Isobel had driven the minibus around the back of the house and parked it in the yard and , by the time Archie returned to the kitchen , they were there , his wife and his son , flinging open the door and staggering triumphantly through it , each weighed down by two huge baskets brimming with dark fruit . After a session in the bramble thickets they were both disreputable , dirty , and mud-stained , and looked , Archie decided fondly , no better than a pair of tinkers . Every time he set eyes on Hamish , he knew a small shock of surprise , because the boy , these summer holidays , had grown like a young tree , getting taller and larger by the day . At twelve , he now topped his mother , and his out-at-elbow sweater was strained across a pair of muscular shoulders . His shirt hung out of his jeans , purple juice           hair was sorely in need of a cut . Archie , eyeing him , was filled with pride . " Hi , Dad . " Dumping the baskets onto the kitchen table , Hamish groaned . " I \'m starving . " " You \'re always starving . " Isobel , too , set down her load . " Hamish , you \'ve been eating blackberries all afternoon . " She wore her baggy corduroys and a shirt that Archie had long since discarded . " You ca n\'t be hungry . " " I am . Blackberries do n\'t fill you up . " Hamish was headed for the dresser where the cake tins were stacked . He removed a lid with a clatter and reached for a knife . Archie admired their harvest . " You \'ve done frightfully well . " " We must have picked about thirty pounds . I \'ve never seen so many . We went over to the other side of the river where Mr. Gladstone grows his turnips . The hedgerows around those fields are groaning with fruit . " Isobel pulled           die for a cup of tea . " Archie said , " I have news for you . " She looked up quickly , always fearing the worst . " Good news ? " " The best , " he told her . " But when did she call ? What did she say ? Why did n\'t she let us know before ? " Isobel , alight with excitement , gave Archie no time to answer any question . " Why did n\'t they call us from Palma , or France , and give us more notice ? Not that I need a moment \'s notice , it does n\'t matter ; all that matters is that they \'re coming , And staying at the Ritz . I do n\'t think p211 that Lucilla \'s ever stayed in a hotel in the whole of her life . Pandora is ridiculous . They could easily have gone somewhere a little less grand .... " " Pandora probably does n\'t know anywhere else . " " And they \'re staying over the dance ? And she \'s bringing the sheepfarmer ?           It \'s so extraordinary , after all these years , that it \'s taken Lucilla to persuade her . I \'ll have to get all the bedrooms ready . We \'ll be quite a house party because we \'ve got that American friend of Katy \'s coming as well . And food . I think there are still some pheasants in the deep-freeze . . . . " They were , by now , sitting around the table and drinking tea . Hamish , in famished desperation , had put the kettle on and made this . While his parents talked , he had set the table with three mugs , the tins that contained the cakes and biscuits , and a loaf of bread on its wooden board . As well , he had found butter and a jar of Branston Pickle . Hamish had , just now , a passion for Branston Pickle and spread it on everything . He was , at this moment , engaged in concocting a sandwich , the dark pickle oozing out between two enormous doorstops of bread . did she tell you           her ? " " Not very much . Just sounded pleased with life . " " Oh , I wish I \'d been here to talk to her . " " You can talk to her tomorrow . " " Have you told anyone else they \'re coming ? " " No . Just you . " " I \'ll have to call Verena and tell her she \'s got three more people coming to her party . And I must tell Virginia . And Vi . " Archie reached for the teapot and refilled his mug . " I was thinking . Perhaps it would be a good idea to ask all the Airds for lunch on Sunday ? What do you say ? After all , we do n\'t know how long Pandora \'s going to be staying , and next week \'s going to be like a three-ring circus with one thing and another . Sunday might be a good day . " " That \'s a brilliant idea . I \'ll ring Virginia . And I \'ll order a sirloin from the butcher . " Hamish           of gingerbread . " ... and if it \'s a fine day we can play croquet . We have n\'t played croquet all summer . You \'ll have to cut the grass , Archie . " She set down her mug , businesslike . " Now . I \'ve got to make bramble jelly , and I \'ll 212 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p212 have to get all the bedrooms ready . But I must n\'t forget to ring Virginia . . . . " " I \'ll do that , " said Archie . " You can leave that to me . " But Isobel , with the great jelly-pan set on the Aga and the blackberries simmering , knew that if she did not share her exciting news with somebody , she would burst , and so found time to call Violet . At first there was no reply from Pennyburn , so she hung up and called again half an hour later . " Hello . " " Vi , it \'s Isobel . " " Oh , my dear . " " Are you busy ? " "           my hand . " " But , Vi , it \'s only half past five . Have you taken to the bottle ? " " Temporarily . I \'ve had the most exhausting day of my life , wheeling Lottie Carstairs around Relkirk and giving her tea . Never mind , it \'s all over now and I \'ve done my good deed for the week . But I did feel I deserved a large whisky and soda . " " You certainly do . Or even two large whiskies and soda . Vi , something really exciting has happened . Lucilla rang from London and she \'s coming home tomorrow and she \'s bringing Pandora with her . " " She \'s bringing who ? " " Pandora . Archie \'s over the moon with delight . Just think . He \'s been trying to get her back to Croy for the past twenty-one years and now she \'s actually coming . " " I ca n\'t believe it . " " Incredible , is n\'t it ? Come for lunch on Sunday and see them all . We           can come with them . " " I \'d love to do that . But . . . Isobel , why did she suddenly decide to come ? Pandora , I mean . " " No idea . Lucilla said something about the Steyntons \' party , but it seems a fairly feeble excuse . " " How extraordinary , I . . . I . . . wonder what she will look like ? " " No idea . Probably smashing . Except that she \'s thirty-nine now , so there are bound to be a few wrinkles . Anyway , we \'ll soon see for our- p213 selves . I must go , Vi . I \'m making bramble jelly and it \'s just about to boil over . See you Sunday . " " So kind . And I \'m thrilled about Lucilla ... " But the brambles claimed Isobel . " \' Bye , Vi . " And she rang off . Pandora . Vi put down her receiver , took off her spectacles , and rubbed her aching eyes . She had been tired before           , left her with the sensation that she was being beleaguered . As though impossible demands were about to be made of her , and vital decisions to be made . She lay back in her chair and closed her eyes , wished that Edie were here , her oldest and dearest friend , so that she could confide , and discuss , and be comforted . But Edie was in her cottage , lumbered with Lottie , and even a telephone call was out of the question , with Lottie listening to every word and drawing her own dangerous conclusions . Pandora . Now thirty-nine , but because Violet had not seen her since she was eighteen , she had stayed , in Violet \'s mind , perpetually that enchanting teenager . Like a person already dead . People who had died never aged , just stayed in the memory the way they had once been . Archie and Edmund had matured to middle age , but not Pandora . Which was ridiculous . Everybody grew older at the same speed , like people at airports being carried along           lived a life , if all accounts were to be believed , that was anything but quiet and peaceful . Experience would have left its mark , drawing lines , wrinkling skin , dulling the bright lustre of that amazing hair . But it was almost impossible to imagine . Violet sighed , opened her eyes , reached for her drink . This would not do . She must pull herself together . The implications of the situation had nothing to do with her . She would make no decision because there was none to be made . She would simply continue to do what she had always done , which was to observe , disregard , and keep her counsel . Edmund Aird , returning home to Balnaid from Edinburgh at seven o\'clock in the evening , walked through his front door just as the telephone started to ring . Standing in the hall , he paused , but when no one 214 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p214 immediately answered the call , he laid his brief-case down on the table and went to the library , to sit at his           . " " Edmund . Archie here . " " Yes , Archie . " " Isobel asked me to call you . She wants you and Virginia and Henry to come for lunch on Sunday . We \'ve asked Vi as well . Can you make it ? " " How very kind of Isobel . I think so . . . just a moment . . . " He reached in his pocket for his diary , laid it on the blotter , turned the pages . " As far as I \'m concerned , that would be fine , but I \'m only just back and I have n\'t spoken to Virginia yet . Do you want me to go and find her ? " " No , do n\'t bother . You can ring me if you ca n\'t come , and if we do n\'t hear , we \'ll expect you all at about a quarter to one . " " We look forward to it . " Edmund hesitated . " Is this for some occasion we should know about , or just a           " And then said , " Yes . I mean , it is an occasion . Lucilla \'s coming home tomorrow .... " " That \'s great news . " " She \'s bringing some Australian with her . " " The sheep-farmer ? " " That \'s right . And she \'s bringing Pandora . " Edmund , with some deliberation , closed his diary . It was bound in navy-blue hide , with his initials in gold in one corner , It had been in his stocking last Christmas , a present from Virginia . " Pandora ? " " Yes . Lucilla and the sheep-farmer went to stay with her in Majorca . They \'ve all come back together , driving through Spain and France . Got to London this morning . " Archie paused , as though waiting for some comment from Edmund . But Edmund did not speak and , after a bit , Archie went on . " I forwarded an invitation from Verena Steynton , so I suppose she thought it might be fun to come home for the party . " "           " Yes . " Another pause . " Sunday then , Edmund ? " " Yes , of course . " " Unless we hear from you . " " We look forward to it . Thank you for calling . " He rang off . The library , the house were silent . It occurred to him that perhaps Virginia an Henry were out somewhere , and he was totally alone . This sense of olitude grew , became oppressive . He found himself straining his ears , needing the reassurance of a raised voice , the clatter of dishes , the bark of a dog . Nothing . Then , from beyond the open window , p215 came the long , bubbling call of a curlew , flying low over the fields beyond the garden . A cloud covered the sun , and the cool air stirred . He put the diary back in his pocket , smoothed his hair with his hand , straightened his tie . He needed a drink . He got up from the chair , left the room , and went in search           Tenth LUCILLA SAID , " I \'VE NEVER COME home in such style before . " " How did you come before ? " Jeff was driving . He had been at the wheel the whole of their long journey north . " In trains from school . Or driving a ratty little car from Edinburgh . Once I flew from London , but that was in the days when Dad was still a soldier and the War Office paid my fare . " It was half past three , a Saturday afternoon , and now there were only twenty miles to go . They had made good time . The motorway was behind them , Relkirk bypassed , and the winding road comfortingly familiar , leading them to Strathcroy and home . The river kept them company , and ahead lay the hills . The air was clear , the sky enormous , and the fresh breeze , sweeping in through opened windows , sweet and heady as young wine . Lucilla could scarcely believe their good fortune . It had been raining in London and pouring in the           had watched the clouds disintegrate , disperse , roll away to the east , and Scotland welcomed them with a blue sky and trees just on the point of turning gold . Lucilla thought that this was extremely obliging of her native country and felt as pleased as if she , personally , had stage-managed the miraculous transformation , but deliberately made no comment on either their luck or the stunning scenery . She had known Jeff for long enough to discover that he did not appreciate , and was even embarrassed by , over-effusion . They had set off at ten o\'clock this morning , checking out of the Ritz , and watching the majestic porters load Pandora \'s dark-red Mercedes with her impressive array of matched luggage , along with their own humble backpacks . Pandora had forgotten to tip the porters , so Lucilla p217 had had to do it for her . She knew that she would never get it back , but after a night of total luxury with dinner and breakfast thrown in , she felt that it was the least she could do           front of her magnificent car , cosy in her mink , because after the nailing heat of a Majorcan August , she felt in need of its opulent comfort . The cold and the rain were not what she had expected . While Jeff drove them out of the city , jousted with traffic , achieved the motorway , she kept up an endless stream of inconsequential chat . Later , she fell silent , gazing out of the window at the grey and dull countryside through which they swept , in the fast lane , at eighty miles an hour . The windscreen wipers worked flat out , immense juggernauts sent up blinding , muddy showers of spray , and even Lucilla had to admit that it was all thoroughly disagreeable . " Goodness , it \'s ugly . " Pandora snuggled deeper into her fur . " I know . But it \'s just this bit . " For lunch , they stopped at a Motorway Service Station . Pandora wanted to leave the motorway and go in search of some wayside pub , preferably thatched , where           concoctions like whisky and ginger ale . But Lucilla knew that if they allowed themselves to be so diverted , they would never get back to Croy . " There is n\'t time . This is n\'t Spain , Pandora . It is n\'t France . We \'ve no time to waste on frivolities . " " Darling , hardly a frivolity . " " Yes , it is . And you \'d get talking to the barman and we \'d be there forever . " So the Motorway Service Station it was , which proved just as unenjoyable as Lucilla feared it would be . Queuing with trays for sandwiches and coffee ; and then sitting on orange plastic chairs at a Formica table , hemmed in by irritable families with fractious children , punky youths in pornographic T-shirts , and muscular truck drivers , all seemingly content to wrap themselves around mind-boggling platefuls of fish and chips , evilly coloured trifles , and cups of tea . After lunch , Pandora and Lucilla had changed places ; Pandora had made herself comfortable on the back seat and fallen           which meant that she had missed the dramatic crossing of the Border , the clearing of the sky , and the miraculous cxcitement of actually coming home . They drove through a small country town . " Where \'s this ? " Jeff asked . " Kirkthornton . " The pavements were crammed with Saturday-afternoon shoppers , the municipal gardens bright with dahlias . Old men sat on benches enjoying 218 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p218 the kindly warmth . Children licked ice-creams . A bridge curved high over a tumbling river . A man fished . The road led on up the hill . Pandora , bundled in mink , was curled up like a child , her head supported by Jeff \'s jacket rolled into a pillow . A lock of bright hair fell across her face , her lashes lay black on her jutting cheek-bones . " Do you think I should wake her up ? " " Up to you . " This had been her pattern , her routine , all through the long journey from Palma , through Spain and France . Spurts of immense energy           impetuous suggestions . We really should see that cathedral . It \'s only ten kilometers out of our way . Look at that delicious river . Why do n\'t we stop for a moment and have a skinny-dip ? There \'s no one to see . You know , we \'ve just passed the most enchanting cafe . Let \'s turn round and go back and have a drink . But the drink would spin out into a long and leisurely lunch , with Pandora falling into conversation with any person who happened to be within earshot . Another bottle of wine . Coffee and cognac . And then ... out . Sleep . She could catnap anywhere , and though this was sometimes embarrassing , it meant , at least , that she stopped talking , and Lucilla and Jeff had learned to be grateful for these respites . Without them Lucilla was not certain whether they would have survived the passage . Travelling with Pandora was a little like travelling with an ebullient child , or a dog -- entertaining and companionable but as well quite dauntingly draining           , the countryside opened and the views were magnificent . Beeches , fields , scattered farms , grazing sheep , the river far below them , the far-away hills bloomy and purple as ripe plums . " If I do n\'t wake her now she \'ll still be asleep when we get home . It \'s only about ten minutes away . " " Then wake her . " Lucilla stretched out her arm , laid her hand on the soft fur of Pando-ra \'s shoulder and gave her a little shake . " Pandora . " " Um . " " Pandora . " Another shake . " Wake up . We \'re almost there . We \'re almost home . " " What ? " Pandora \'s eyes fluttered open . They stared blankly , disonen- p219 tated , confused . She closed them again , yawned , stirred , stretched . " What a lovely sleep . Where are we ? " " Heading for Caple Bridge . Almost home . " " Almost home ? Almost at Croy ? " " Sit up and you \'ll           drive , snoring away on the back seat . " " I was n\'t snoring . I never snore . " But after a bit she made an effort and did sit up , pushing her hair out of her eyes , gathering her furs around her as though chilled . She yawned again , stared from the window . Blinked . Her eyes brightened . " But ... we \'re nearly there ! " " I told you . " " You should have woken me hours ago . And the rain \'s gone . It \'s all sunshiny . And the green . I \'d forgotten such greenness . What a welcome . Caledonia , stern and wild , fit nurse for a poetic child . \' Who wrote that ? Some stupid old fool . It \'s not stern and wild , it \'s just utterly beautiful . How perfectly sweet of it to be looking so lovely . " She groped for her bag , her comb ; tidied her hair . A mirror , some lipstick . A generous splash of Poison . " I           forget about his leg . Do n\'t expect him to come running to sweep you up in his arms . If he sweeps you up in his arms , he \'ll probably fall flat on his back . " " As if I \'d suggest such a thing . " She looked at her tiny diamond watch . " We \'re early . We said we \'d be there at five and it \'s not four o\'clock yet . " " We \'ve made fantastic time . " " Dear Jeff . " Pandora gave his shoulder an appreciative thump , as though she were patting a dog ; " What a clever driver . " Now they were running downhill . At the bottom of the incline , they took the steep hump of Caple Bridge , turned left , and were at the start of the glen . Pandora leaned forward in her seat . " But it \'s amazing . Absolutely nothing seems to have changed . Some people called Miller used to live in that cottage . They were terribly old . He \'d been a           used to keep bees and sell jars of heather honey . Oh dear , I \'m getting so fraught , I think I might have to stop for a pee . No , of course I do n\'t want to . Just imagination . " She gave Jeff another thump on his shoulder . " Jeff , you \'re doing your silent act again . Ca n\'t you think up one small word of appreciation ? " " Sure , " he grinned . " It \'s great . " " It \'s more than that . It \'s our country now . The Balmerinos of Croy . Really heart-stirring , like a roll of drums . And we \'re coming home . We should be wearing feathers in our bonnets , and there should be a piper 220 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p220 playing somewhere . Why did n\'t you think of that , Lucilla ? Why did n\'t you arrange it ? After twenty years , surely it \'s the least you could have done for me . " Lucilla laughed . " I \'m sorry . " Now the           verdant with green rushes , the pastures on the other side grazed by peaceful herds of Friesian cows . Harvested fields were carpets of gold in the sunlight . The Mercedes swept around the curve of the road and the village of Strathcroy came into view . Lucilla saw the cluster of grey stone houses , smoke rising straight from chimney-pots , the tower of the church , the pleasing groups of ancient and shady beeches and oaks . Jeff slowed down to a prudent speed and they passed the War Memorial , the small Episcopal church , and were into the long , straight main street . " The supermarket \'s new . " Pandora sounded quite accusing . " I know . It \'s run by people called Ishak . They \'re Pakistanis . Now , Jeff , it \'s here . . . turn right . . up through the gates . . . . " " But the park \'s gone ! It \'s not parkland any more . It \'s all ploughed up . " Pandora , you knew that happened . Dad wrote and           But it does look strange . " Up the back drive . The hill reared ahead of them , the tumbling waters of the Pennyburn splashed and tumbled down under the little stone bridge . Then the avenue .. . " We \'re here , " said Lucilla , and leaned across Jeff to put the heel of her hand on the horn . At Croy , Lucilla \'s family filled in the long waiting hours of the afternoon . Isobel was upstairs seeing to the final details of the visitors \' bedrooms , checking clean towels and arranging flowers for dressing-tables and mantelpieces . Hamish had decided to take the dogs for a walk , disappeared after lunch and had not been seen since . And Archie , Lord Balmerino , was in the dining-room laying the table for dinner . He had been finally forced into doing this . Waiting for anything or anybody was not his strong point , and as the day wore on , he had become increasingly restless , impatient , and anxious . He hated the thought of his loved ones belting up           had no difficulty at all in presenting hideously detailed pic- p221 tures of pile-ups , mangled metal , and dead bodies . He had spent much time looking at his watch , going to the window at the faintest sound of a car engine , and was patently unable to settle for a moment . Isobel had suggested that he mow the croquet lawn but he had turned this down because he wanted to be certain of being on the spot when the car actually drew up in front of the house . Retreating to his study , he had sat down with The Scotsman but could not concentrate either on the news or the crossword . He tossed the paper aside and started prowling again . At last Isobel , who had enough to do without her husband getting under her feet , lost her patience . " Archie , if you ca n\'t sit still , then make yourself useful . You can lay the table for dinner . The clean mats and the napkins are on the side-board . " And she had gone upstairs quite crossly           minded laying tables . In the old days , Harris used to perform the task , so there could be nothing unmanly about it . And when the American paying guests stayed , laying the table for dinner was always Archie \'s job , and he got certain pleasure from doing it with military thoroughness , knives and forks precisely aligned , and napkins folded into mitres . The wineglasses looked slightly dusty , so he had found a tea-towel and was engaged in giving them a bit of a polish when he heard the car coming up the hill . His heart lurched . He looked at the clock , which told him four o\'clock . Too early surely . He set down the glass and the cloth . It could not be ... . The blast of the car horn , a long continuous blare , tore the quiet afternoon and his own uncertainty into shreds . Lucilla \'s traditional signal . He could not move fast , but he moved as fast as he could . Down the length of the dining-room , through the door .           He was crossing the hall as the car appeared , a thundering great Mercedes scattering gravel beneath its wheels . " Isobel ! They \'re here . " He got to the door but no farther . Pandora was quicker than he , out of the car almost before it had drawn to a halt , running across the gravel towards him . Pandora with that same bright hair flying all over the place and those same long spindly legs . " Archie ! " She wore a fur coat that reached almost to her ankles but that did not stop her bounding two at a time up the steps , and if he could no longer Ift her off her feet and whirl her around the way he used to when she was i p222 a child , there was nothing the matter with his arms , and his arms were ready and waiting for her . Isobel ... dear , uncomplicated , hospitable , unchanging Isobel . . had allocated Pandora the best spare bedroom . This was in the front of the house , with tall sash           and the river . It was furnished much as Pandora remembered it in her mother \'s day . Twin brass bedsteads , high off the ground , each wide as a small double bed . A faded carpet patterned with roses and an ornate dressing-table with many small drawers and a swing-mirror . The old curtains , however , were gone , and heavy cream linen draperies hung in their place . The refurbishment had probably been planned with all the paying guests in mind . They would scarcely appreciate threadbare chintz with sun-rotted linings . For them as well , the adjoining dressingroom had been converted into a bathroom . Not that it looked very different , because Isobel had simply installed a bath and a basin and a lavatory , and left the rugs , the laden bookshelves , and the comfortable armchair where they were . Pandora was meant to be unpacking . " Unpack and make yourself comfortable , " Isobel had told her . She and Jeff , between them , had humped all Pandora \'s luggage upstairs . ( Archie , of course ,           Pandora decided not to think about Archie . His grey hairs had shocked her , and she had never seen a man so thin . ) " Have a bath if you want . There \'s gallons of hot water . Then come down and have a drink . We \'ll eat about eight o\'clock . " But that was fifteen minutes ago and Pandora had got no farther than carrying her dressing-case into the bathroom and putting a few bottles out on the marble wash-stand . Her pills and potions , her Poison , bath-oil , creams and cleansers . Later she would have a bath . Not now . Now , she still had to convince herself that she was really home . Back at Croy . But it was difficult because in this room she did not feel as though she belonged . She was a guest come to stay , a bird of passage . Abandoning her bottles , she went back to the bedroom , to the window , to lean out with her elbows on the sill , to gaze at the oft-remembered view           all a dream . This took some time . But what had happened to her own room , the room that had been Pandora \'s since babyhood ? She decided to go and have a nose-around. p223 She went out of the room , went to the top of the stairs , paused . From the direction of the kitchen came cheerful domestic sounds and muted voices . Lucilla and Isobel busy with preparations for dinner and probably talking about Pandora . They were bound to talk . It did not matter ; she did not mind . She crossed the landing and opened the door of what had been her parents \' room , and was now Archie and Isobel \'s . She saw the huge double bed , the chaise longue at the foot of it with a sweater of Isobel \'s flung down , a pair of shoes , carelessly discarded . She saw the family photographs , the silver and crystal on the dressing-table , bedside books . There was the smell of face-powder and eau-de-cologne . Sweet and innocent scents . She closed the door           room that had been Archie \'s , swept and garnished with Jeff \'s backpack and his jacket set down in the middle of the carpet . The next room . . . Lucilla . Still filled with all the cherished flotsam of a schoolgirl . . . posters thumbtacked to the walls , china ornaments , a tape player , a guitar with a broken string . And finally her own room . Her old room . Perhaps Hamish slept here ? She had not yet met Hamish . Cautiously she turned the knob and pushed the door open . Not Hamish . Not anybody . Empty of any personal possession . New furniture , new curtains . No trace of Pandora . What had they done with her books , her records , clothes , diaries , photographs . . . her life ? All probably swept upstairs to some attic when the room was stripped and emptied , repainted , re-wallpapered , and given that beautiful new , blue , fitted carpet . It was as though Pandora had ceased to exist , was already a ghost .           was patently obvious . Croy belonged to Archie and Isobel , and to keep the place going as a viable proposition , every room must be put to good use . And Pandora had given up any claim to it by the simple act of going away and never coming back . Standing there , she thought of those last miserable weeks when she had been beyond herself with an unhappiness that she was not allowed to talk about . Misery had made her cruel , and she was cruel to the two people she loved most in the world ; snapping at her father , ignoring her mother , sulking for days on end and generally making their lives a mis-cry . In this room , she had spent hours lying face downwards on her bed with her record player churning out , over and over again , the saddest gongs she knew . Matt Monro telling some female to " Walk Away . " And udy Garland tearing her guts out with " The Man That Got Away . " 224 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p224 The road gets tougher           burn up , Tomorrow he will turn up .. Voices . Darling , do come and eat some lunch . I do n\'t want any lunch . I wish you \'d tell me what \'s troubling you . I just want to be left alone . It would n\'t be any good telling you . You \'d never understand ... . She saw again her mother \'s face , confused and dreadfully hurt . And was ashamed . At eighteen , I should have known better . I thought that I was adult and sophisticated , but the truth was that I knew less about life than a child . And it took me too long to find out . Too long , and too late . All over , She closed the door and went back to her unpacking . Dinner was over . They had sat , the six of them , around the candle-lit table , and eaten their way through Isobel \'s lovingly prepared celebratory meal . If she had not exactly killed a fatted calf , she had gone to great pains to produce a           brulee , and a splendid Stilton , all washed down by the best wine that Archie could bring up from his father \'s depleted cellar . Now it was nearly ten o\'clock , and Isobel , with Pandora in attendance , was in the kitchen dealing with the last of the washing-up -- the pots and pans , the ivory-handled knives and vegetable dishes too large to fit into the dishwasher . Pandora was meant to be helping , but after drying up a knife or two and putting three saucepans into the wrong cupboard , she had laid aside the tea-towel , made herself a mug of Nescafe , and sat down to drink it . Conversation during dinner had been non-stop , for there was much to hear and much to tell . The adventure of Lucilla and Jeff \'s bus journey down through France from Paris ; their Bohemian sojourn in Ibiza ; and at last the bliss of Majorca and the Casa Rosa . Isobel \'s mouth had watered , hearing Lucilla \'s description of the garden there . p225 " Oh , I would love           Lie in the sun and do nothing . " Archie laughed at this . " Isobel lie in the sun and do nothing ? You must be mad . Before you could blink , she \'d be bottoms up in the flower-beds , tearing at weeds . " " I have n\'t got any weeds , " said Pandora .. And then , home news . Pandora was avid for every scrap of gossip . The latest on Vi , the Airds , the Gillocks , Willy Snoddy . Did Archie still hear from Harris and Mrs. Harris ? She listened with some dismay to the saga of Edie Findhorn and her cousin Lottie . " Heavens ! That ghoul . Do n\'t say she \'s come back into our lives . I \'m glad you warned me . I shall take pains to cross the road if I see her coming . " She was told about the Ishak family , exiled from Malawi and arriving in Strathcroy with scarcely a penny between them . " . . . but they had some relations in Glasgow who \'d already           a bit of financial help from them , they managed to take over Mrs. McTaggart \'s newsagent \'s shop . You would n\'t recognize the place . It \'s a proper supermarket . We did n\'t think they \'d last , but we were all mistaken . They \'re as industrious as ants , never seem to close their shop , and business booms . As well , we like them . They \'re all so helpful and kind . " And so on to the Balmerinos \' slightly grander neighbours , which meant anybody living within a radius of twenty miles : the BuchananWrights , the Ferguson-Crombies , the new people who had come to live at Ardnamoy ; whose daughter had married ; whose unlikely son had become a money-broker in the City and was coining millions . No detail was unimportant . The only topic that was never brought up , as though by tacit agreement , was Pandora and what she had been doing with herself for the past twenty-one years . She did not mind . She was back at Croy and for the moment           into unreality , like a life that had happened to another person , and surrounded by family she was happy to consign them to oblivion . Sitting at the kitchen table , she sipped coffee and watched Isobel at the sink , scouring the roasting pan . Isobel wore red rubber gloves and a blue-226 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p226 and-white apron tied over her tidy dress , and it occurred to Pandora that she was an exceptional woman , peacefully labouring away and quite unresentful of the fact that the rest of her family had taken themselves off , and she was left to clear up the detritus of the meal by herself . For , after dinner , the others had all dispersed . Archie , excusing himself , had gone down to his workshop . Hamish , with the promise of financial reward , had agreed to take advantage of the long evening light and mow the croquet lawn . He had gone to do this with good grace , and Pandora was much impressed . What she did not realize was how impressed Hamish had been by her           . Hamish had visions of a Vi-type person with grey hair and laced-up shoes , and had received the shock of his life when he was introduced to Pandora . A stunner . Like a film star . Over his pheasant , he entertained fantasies of showing her off to the other seniors in his class at Templehall . Perhaps Dad would bring her over to watch some match or other . Hamish \'s stock with schoolmates would go sky-high . He wondered if she liked rugger . " Isobel , I do love Hamish . " " I \'m quite keen on him myself . I just hope he does n\'t grow too enor-mous . " " He \'s going to be divinely handsome . " She took another mouthful of coffee . " Do you like Jeff ? " Jeff , predictably sated by two weeks of female company and unaccustomed gracious living , had wheeled Lucilla down to the Strathcroy Arms for a restoring jar of Foster \'s lager downed in comfortably masculine surroundings . " He seems really nice . " " Terribly kind . And           his patience . A bit laconic , though . I suppose all Australians are strong and silent . I would n\'t really know . Never met any others . " " Do you think Lucilla \'s in love with him ? " " No , I do n\'t think so . They \'re just . . . that awful phrase . . . very good friends . Besides , she \'s terribly young . You do n\'t want to start thinking about permanent relationships when you \'re only nineteen . " " You mean marriage . " " No , darling . I do n\'t mean marriage . " Isobel fell silent . Pandora decided that she had , perhaps , said the wrong thing and cast about for a more amusing and less touchy topic . " Isobel , I know who you have n\'t told me about . Dermot Honeycombe and Terence . Are they still running the antique shop ? " p227 " Oh dear . " Isobel turned from the sink . " Did n\'t Archie tell you in one of his letters ? So sad           " I do n\'t believe it . What did poor Dermot do ? Find himself another nice young man ? " " No , never . He was heart-broken , but faithful . We all thought he might leave Strathcroy , but he stayed ; all by himself . Still running the antique shop , still living in their little cottage . Every now and then he asks Archie and me over for a meal , and gives us tiny helpings of frightfully dainty food with amusing sauces . Archie always comes home starving and has to be given soup or cornflakes before he goes to bed . " " Poor Dermot . I must go and see him . " " He \'d love that . He \'s always asking after you . " " I can buy some trinket from him to give Katy Steynton for her birthday . We have n\'t talked about that either . The dance , I mean . " Isobel , finished at last , pulled off her rubber gloves , laid them on the drainingboard , and came to sit down with           huge house party ? " " No . Just us . No Hamish because he \'ll be back at school . And some sad American Katy met in London and took pity on . Verena has n\'t got space for him , so he \'s coming here . " " Goodness ! How nice . A man for me . Why is he sad ? " " His wife \'s just died . " " Oh dear , I hope he \'s not too gloomy . Where \'s he going to sleep ? " " In your old bedroom . " Which settled that question . " And what about the night of the party ? Where are we having dinner ? " " Here , I think . We could ask the Airds to join us , and Vi . They \'re coming for lunch tomorrow ; I thought I \'d speak to Virginia then . " " You never said . " " What , that they \'re coming for lunch ? Well , I \'ve told you now . That \'s why Hamish is cutting the croquet           on . What are you going to wear for the dance ? Have you got a new dress ? " " No . I \'ve run out of money . I had to buy Hamish five new pairs of shoes for school .... " " But , Isobel , you must have a new dress . We \'ll go and find one for you . Where shall we go ? To Relkirk . We \'ll have a day out ... " " Pandora , I told you . . . I really ca n\'t afford it . " " Oh , darling , the least I can do is stand you a little gift . " The back door opened and Hamish appeared , having finished his mowing just be-228 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p228 fore darkness fell , and once again in his usual state of ravenous hunger . " We \'ll talk about it later . " Hamish collected his snack . A bowl of Weetabix , a glass of milk , a handful of chocolate biscuits . Pandora finished her coffee , set down the mug . She yawned           I \'m bushed . " She got to her feet . " Good night , Hamish . " She did not attempt to kiss him and Hamish was torn between relief and disappointment . " Will I find Archie in his workshop ? I \'ll just pop down and have a word . " She stooped and kissed Isobel . " And good night to you , darling . Heaven to be here . Delicious dinner . See you all in the morning . " In the basement , Archie , absorbed and concentrated , worked by a strong bulb with a wide shade that threw a bright circle onto his workbench . Painting the carving of Katy and her dog was both tricky and fiddly . The muted check of the skirt , the texture of the sweater , the subtle , varying streaks of colour in the hair , each presented a challenge and took all his dexterity to accomplish . He laid down one sable brush and took up another , then heard Pandora approach . Her step was unmistakable , descending the stone stair that led           of her high heels down the ill-lighted stone-flagged passage . He paused in his work to look up and saw the door open and Pandora \'s head come around the edge of it . " Am I interrupting ? " " No . " " Goodness , it \'s gloomy . I could n\'t find the light switch . Like a dungeon . But I must say , you \'re quite cosy in here . " She found a chair and sat beside him . " What are you doing ? " " Painting . " " I can see that . What a charming little statue . Where did you get it ? " He told her , not without pride . " I made it . " " You made it ? Archie , you are brilliant . I never knew you were so handy . " " It \'s for Katy \'s birthday . It \'s her . With her dog . " " What a lovely idea . You did n\'t used to be able to make things . It was p29 always Pa who glued           go to classes or something ? " " I suppose I did . After I was wounded ... " He corrected himself . " After my leg was shot off and when I was finally discharged from hospital , I got sent to Headley Court . That \'s the Forces rehabilitation centre for chaps who \'ve been disabled . Dismembered in some way . That \'s where they fit the artificial limbs . Legs , arms , hands , feet . Anything that you are missing is supplied for you . Within , of course , reason . And then they give you months of bloody hell until you \'ve learned to use it properly . " " It does n\'t sound very nice . " " It was all right . And there was always some poor bugger worse off than yourself . " " But you were alive . You were n\'t dead . " " True . " " Is it very horrible , having a tin leg ? " " Better than none at all , which seems to be the alternative . " " I           . " " Was it a nightmare ? " " All violence is a nightmare . " Forbidden ground . She backed off . " I \'m sorry . . . go on telling me . " " Well . . . once I . . . " He had lost the thread of what he had been saying . He took off his spectacles , rubbed his eyes with his fingers . " Once .. . I was more or less ambulant , they taught me how to use a treadle jigsaw . Occupational therapy and good exercise for the leg . And from that , it sort of snowballed . .. " It was all right . The dangerous moment was safely over . If Archie did not want to talk about Northern Ireland , then Pandora did not want to hear . " Do you mend things , like Pa used to ? " " Yes . " " And that dear little figure . How do you start to make something like that ? Where do you begin ? " " You start with a block           " " For this one , I used beech . Beech from Croy , a windblown branch from years back . I squared it off into a block with the chainsaw . Then I made two drawings from the photograph , a front view and a side view . Then I transferred the front elevation onto the face of the block , and the side elevation onto the side of the block . Are you with me ? " " All the way . " 230 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p230 " Then I cut it out on the band-saw . " " What \'s a band-saw ? " He pointed . " That \'s the band-saw . It \'s electrically operated and lethally sharp , so do n\'t start fiddling . " " I was n\'t going to . What do you do then ? " " Start carving . Whittling . " " What with ? " " Wood-carver \'s chisels . A penknife . " " I \'m amazed . Is this the first you \'ve done ? " " By no means , but this was more difficult           dog . That was quite difficult . Before , they \'ve been standing figures . Soldiers mostly , in various regimental uniforms . I get the details of the uniforms from a book of plates I found up in Pa \'s library . It was that book that gave me the idea . They make quite good wedding presents if the bridegroom happens to be in the Army . " " Have you got any to show me ? " " Yes . There \'s one here . " He pulled himself out of his chair , went to a cupboard , took out a box . " I did n\'t actually give this one away because I was n\'t quite satisfied with it , so I made another . But it \'ll give you an idea . . . . " Pandora took the figure of the soldier from him and turned it in her hands . It was a replica of an officer in the Black Watch , every detail perfect -- from brogues , to kilt , to the red hackle in his khaki bonnet . She           Archie \'s unsuspected talent , his precision , his undeniable artistry . Also incredulous . " Do you mean to say you give these away ? Archie , you \'re dotty . They \'re beautiful . Unique . Visitors from overseas would snap up just such a souvenir . Have you ever tried selling them ? " " No . " He seemed quite surprised at the idea . " Have you ever thought of it ? " " No . " She knew a burst of sisterly irritation . " You are hopeless . You always were a laid-back old stick , but this is ridiculous . There \'s Isobel slaving away , trying to keep everything going by having strings of Americans to stay , and you could be churning these things out and making a fortune . " " I doubt that . Anyway , it \'s not a case of churning . They take a lot of time . " " Well , get someone to help you . Get two people to help you . Start a little home industry . " " I have           the stables ? They \'re empty . Or one of the barns ? " p231 " It would mean reconstruction , equipping , electricity laid on , safety regulations , fire precautions . " " So ? " " So it would cost money . Which is a commodity pretty thin on the ground . " " Could you get a grant ? " " Grants , as well , are thin on the ground just now . " " You could try for one . Oh , do n\'t be so hopeless , Archie . Be a bit more enterprising . I think it \'s the most wonderful idea . " " Pandora , you were always full of wonderful ideas . " He took the soldier from her and laid him back in his box . " But you \'re right about Isobel . I do what I can to help , but I know she \'s got far too much on her plate . Before Northern Ireland , I thought about trying to get some sort of a job ... as a factor , or something .           I did n\'t want to leave Croy , and it seemed the only sort of work I could do . . . . " His voice , ruminating , trailed to silence . " But now you \'ve learned a new trade . All this . Hidden talents have sprung to life . All you need is a little enterprise and a lot of determina-tion . " " And a lot of money . " " Archie " ? she spoke quite crossly ? " whether you have one leg or two , you ca n\'t just shed responsibility . " " Are you speaking from experience ? " " Touche " Pandora laughed and shook her head . " No . I \'m the last to preach . Just talking off the top of my head . " Abruptly , she abandoned the argument , yawned and stretched , reached upwards , spreading her fingers . " I \'m tired . I came to say good night . I \'m going to bed . " " I hope you have sweet dreams . " " What about you ?           with . Then , every spare moment I have I shall be able to spend with you . " " Dear man . " On her feet , she stooped to kiss him . " I \'m glad I came home . " " Me too . " She went to the door , opened it , hesitated , and turned back . " Archie ? " " What is it ? " " I \'ve often wondered . Did you get that letter I sent you in Berlin ? " " Yes . " " You never replied . " 232 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p232 " By the time I \'d decided what I was going to say , you \'d gone to America and it was too late . " " Did you tell Isobel ? " " No . " " Did you . speak to anybody ? " " No . " " I see . " She smiled . " The Airds are coming for lunch tomorrow . " " I know . I asked them . " " Good night , Archie . " "           The house settled as the momentum of another busy day wound itself down . Hamish watched television for a bit and then made his way upstairs . Isobel , in the kitchen , laid the table for breakfast -- the last chore of the day -- and then let the dogs out for their last sniff around the dark garden , alert for scents of marauding rabbit . Lights were turned off , and she too headed for bed . Later still Jeff and Lucilla returned from the village . They let themselves in through the back door . Archie heard their voices above him in the hall . And then silence . Past midnight , and he was finally finished . Another day and the enamel would be dry . He tidied up , put lids on small paint-pots , cleaned his brushes , turned off the light and closed the door . Slowly he made his way down the shadowy passage and up the stairs to do his nightly rounds , which he called putting the house to bed . He checked locks on doors and snibs on           , he found the dogs asleep . He filled a tumbler with water and drank it . Finally he trod up the stairs . But he did not go immediately to his own bedroom . Instead he walked down the passage and saw the shaft of light , still burning , beneath the door of Lucilla \'s room . He tapped and opened the door and found her in bed , reading by lamplight . " Lucilla . " She looked up , marked her page and laid her book aside . " I thought you \'d gone to bed hours ago . " " No . I \'ve been working . " He came to sit on the edge of her bed . " Did you have a good evening ? " " Yes , it was fun . Toddy Buchanan in his usual good form . " " I wanted to say good night , and I wanted to say thank you . " " What for ? " " Coming home . Bringing Pandora . " His hand lay on her eiderdown . She laid her own           white lawn trimmed with lace , but Lucilla slept in a green T-shirt with " Save the Rain Forests " printed across the chest . Her long dark hair was spread like silk on her pillow , and he was filled with love for her . " You \'re not disappointed ? " she asked him . " Why should I be disappointed ? " " Often when you \'ve looked forward to something for years , you feel a bit let down when it actually happens . " " I do n\'t feel let down . " " She is beautiful . " " But dreadfully thin , do n\'t you think ? " " I know . There \'s nothing of her . But she \'s so hyper that she burns everything up . " " What do you mean ? " " Just that . She sleeps a lot , but when she \'s awake she \'s charging on every cylinder . Super-charging , I would say . Being with her all the time is really quite exhausting . And then she passes out as though sleep           her batteries . " " She was always like that . Mrs. Harris used to say , That Pandora . Either up in the clouds or doon in the midden . \' " " Manic-depressive . " " Surely not as bad as that . " " Tending that way . " He frowned . And then asked the question that had been niggling around at the back of his mind all evening . " You do n\'t think she \'s on drugs ? " " Oh , Dad . " He immediately wished that he had not mentioned his fears . " I only ask you because I imagine you know more about these things than I do . " " She \'s certainly not a junkie . But perhaps she does take something to bubble her along . A lot of people do . " " But she \'s not addicted ? " " Oh , Dad , I do n\'t know . But worrying about Pandora is n\'t going to do any good . You \'ve just got to accept her for what she is . The           . Lots of laughs . " " In Majorca . . . do you think she \'s happy ? " " She seems to be . And why not ? A heavenly house , a garden , a pool , lots of money ... " " Does she have friends ? " " She has Seraphina and Mario , who take care of her ... " " That was n\'t what I meant . " 234 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p234 " I know . No , we did n\'t meet her friends , so I do n\'t know if she has any or not . We did n\'t really meet anybody . Except one man . He was there the day we arrived , but after that we never saw him again . " " I thought she would have a resident lover . " " I think probably he was her lover and the reason he did n\'t come back was because we were there . " He said nothing to this , and Lucilla smiled . " It \'s a different world out there , Dad . " "           her arms around his neck and pulled him down and kissed him . She said , " You must n\'t worry . " " I wo n\'t . " " Good night , Dad . " " Good night , my darling . God bless you . " p235 Sunday the Eleventh SUNDAY MORNING . OVERCAST , VERY STILL , very quiet , hushed with the weekly inertia of a Scottish Sabbath . It had rained during the night , leaving puddles by the roadside and gardens dripping with moisture . In Strathcroy , cottages slumbered , curtains stayed drawn . Slowly the occupants stirred , rose , opened doors , lit fires , made cups of tea . Plumes of peat-smoke rose , straight , from chimney-pots . Dogs were walked , hedges clipped , cars washed . Mr. Ishak opened up his shop for the sale of morning rolls , milk , cigarettes , Sunday newspapers , and any other commodity that a family might need to get through the empty day . From the tower of the Presbyterian church , the bell tolled . At Croy ,           between them , cooked their own breakfast . Bacon and eggs , sausages and tomatoes , racks of fresh toast , marmalade and honey , all washed down with large cups of very strong tea . Isobel , descending later , found their dirty breakfast dishes stacked by the sink , and a note from Hamish , Dear Mum . Jeff and me have taken the dogs up to the loch . He wants to see it . Back about twelve-thirty . In time for beef . Isobel made coffee , sat and drank it , thought about peeling potatoes , making a pudding . She wondered if there was enough cream for a fool . Lucilla appeared , and finally Archie , wearing his good tweed suit because it was his day to read the lesson in church . Neither his wife nor his daughter offered to accompany him . With ten people for lunch , they had more than enough to do . Pandora slept the morning through and did not put in an appearance 236 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p236 until a quarter past twelve , by which time           . It was instantly clear , however , that she had not been idle , but busy titivating : painting her nails , washing her hair , doing her face , splashing herself in Poison . She wore a jersey dress patterned in diamonds of brilliant colour ; it was so fine and supple and elegant that it had to be Italian . Discovering Lucilla in the library , she swore that she had slept the night through , but seemed perfectly happy to sink into the depths of an armchair and gratefully accept the offer of a glass of sherry . At Pennyburn , Vi sat up in her bed , drank her early morning tea , and planned her day . She should perhaps go to church . There was plenty to pray for . She thought about this and then decided against it . Instead , selfindulgence . She would stay where she was , conserving her energy . She \'d finish her current book and then , after a late breakfast , sit at her desk to deal with overdue bills , pension funds , and           , she had been invited to Croy . Edmund , with Virginia and Henry , would pick her up and drive her on up the hill . She thought about this with more disquiet than delight and gazed from the window and assessed the mood of the weather : rain all night but now damp and still and muggy . Perhaps later it would cheer up . It was the sort of day , in more ways than one , that needed to be cheered up . For comfort , she decided , she would wear her grey wool . For courage , the new Hermes scarf . At Balnaid , Virginia went in search of Henry . " Henry , come and change . " He was on the floor of his playroom , constructing Space Lego , and resented the interruption . " Why do I have to change ? " " Because we \'re going out for lunch and you ca n\'t go looking like that . " " Why ca n\'t I ? " p237 " Because your jeans are dirty , and your T-shirt \'s           are dirty . " " Do I have to dress up ? " " No , but you have to put on a clean T-shirt and a clean pair of jeans and a clean pair of sneakers . " " What about socks ? " " Clean socks . " He sighed , hard done by . " Do I have to put my Space Lego away ? " " No , of course you do n\'t have to . Leave it where it is . Just come , or Daddy \'ll start getting impatient . " She led him , lagging , to his bedroom , then sat on his bed and stripped off his T-shirt . " Will there be any other children there ? " " Hamish . " " He wo n\'t want to play with me . " " Henry , you \'re such a ninny about Hamish . If you do n\'t behave like a ninny , he \'ll like playing with you . Take off your jeans and your trainers . " " Who \'s going to be there ? " " Us           because she \'s come home from France . And her friend . He \'s called Jeff . And Pandora " " Who \'s Pandora ? " " Archie \'s sister . " " Do I know her ? " " No . " " Do you know her ? " " No . " " Does Daddy know her ? " " Yes . He knew her when she was a little girl . Vi knows her too . " " Why do n\'t you know her ? " " Because she \'s been living abroad for a long , long time . She lived in America . This is the first time she \'s come back to Croy . " " Does Alexa know her ? " " No . Alexa was only a tiny baby when she went to America . " " Does Pandora know your gramps and grandma at Leesport ? " " No . They live in Long Island , and Pandora lived in California . That \'s right over the other side of the United States . " " Does Edie know her ?           a little girl as well . " " What does she look like ? " " Heavens above , Henry , I \'ve never met her , so I ca n\'t tell you . But you p238 know that picture in the dining-room at Croy ? Of the pretty girl ? Well , that \'s Pandora when she was young . " " I hope she \'s still pretty " " You like pretty ladies . " " Well , I certainly do n\'t like ugly ones . " He screwed up his face , making a monster grimace . " Like that Lottie Carstairs . " Despite herself , Virginia had to laugh . " You know something , Henry Aird , you \'ll be the death of me . Now , hand me your hairbrush , and then go and wash your hands . " From the foot of the stairs , Edmund called , " Virginia . " " We \'re on our way ! " He waited for them , dressed for the occasion in grey flannels , a country shirt , a club tie ,           " We should go . " Reaching his side , Virginia kissed him . " You \'re looking handsome , Mr. Aird . Did you know that ? " " You \'re not looking so gruesome yourself . Come along , Henry . " They got into the BMW and drove . They stopped for a moment in the village , where Edmund went into Mr , Ishak \'s and emerged with the bulky wodge of the Sunday newspapers . Then on to Pennyburn . Vi heard them coming and was ready for them , on the point of locking her front door . Edmund leaned over to open the door for her and she got in beside him . Henry thought she was looking very smart and told her so . " Thank you , Henry . This is the pretty scarf your mother brought me from London . " " I know . She brought me a cricket bat and a ball . " " You showed me . " " And she brought Edie a cardigan , Edie loves it . She says she \'s keeping it           " " Lilac , " Virginia told him . " Lilac . " He said the word over to himself because it had a pleasant sound . Lilac . The powerful car left Pennyburn behind and sped on up the hill , Arriving , they found Archie \'s old Land Rover parked in front of the house , As Edmund drew up alongside and the Aird family disgorged from his car , Archie appeared at the open front door , come to greet them . They made their way up the steps . " Well , here you are . " " You \'re looking very formal , Archie , " Edmund told him . " I hope I \'m not underdressed. " p239 " Been to church . Read the lesson . I thought about changing into something a little less stuffy , but now you \'ve arrived , so there is n\'t time . So you \'ll have to take me as I am . Vi . Virginia . Lovely to see you . Hello , Henry , good morning . How are you ? Hamish is in           Scalectrix Road Race up on the floor of the playroom . If you want to go and have a look at it ... " The suggestion , casually made , was adroit and caught Henry \'s attention , as Archie knew it would . He had no qualms about his son , who had been warned that Henry was coming , and had it made clear to him that he was to behave towards this small guest in a hospitable fashion . As for Henry , it took only an instant to remember that Hamish , provided there was nobody else around to claim his attention , could be quite good company , even though Henry was four years younger . And Henry had n\'t got a Scalectrix Road Race . It was one of the things he was thinking of putting on his Christmas list . His face brightened . He said " All right " and set off at a fast clip , up the stairs , leaving the grown-ups to their own devices . " Brilliant , " murmured Vi , as though to herself . And           have this morning ? " " Sixteen , including the rector . " " I should have been there to swell the throng . Now I \'m going to have a conscience for the rest of the day .... " " But it \'s not all bad news . The Bishop \'s come up trumps and ferreted out some obscure trust , set up years ago . He thinks he can wangle a sizy sum from that , which would pay off the balance of the bill for the elee-tries .... " " Would n\'t that be splendid ? " " But , " said Virginia , " I thought that was why we had the church sale . . . " " We can always divert funds . . . . " Edmund made no comment . It had been a long morning , deliberately filled with small and insignificant tasks that nevertheless had been demanding his attention for some weeks . Letters written , accounts paid , a query from his chartered accountant clarified and answered . Now , he found himself dealing with a growing impatience .           double doors of the library stood invitingly open . He looked forward to a gin and tonic , but Archie , Virginia , and Vi , loosely grouped at the foot of the stairs , had become absorbed by churchly problems . In these Edmund had little interest , having always taken great pains never to become involved . .. of course , we do need new kneelers. " 240 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p240 " Vi , paying for the coke for the boiler is more urgent than new kneel-ers .... " The real reason for their coming to Croy appeared to have been forgotten by his wife and his mother . Stifling his irritation , Edmund listened . And then did not listen . Another sound caught his attention . From the library came the tap of high heels . He looked up , over the top of Virgin-ia \'s head . Saw Pandora emerge . Watching , assessing the situation , she paused , framed by the open doorway . Across the long space that divided them , her eyes met Ed-mund \'s . He forgot his impatience ,           had been abruptly asked to produce some sort of a report and was frantically searching for , and then abandoning , suitable adjectives with which to state his case : older , thinner , attenuated , elegant , mondaine , amoral , experienced . Beautiful . Pandora . He would have seen her , recognized her , known her anywhere in the world . Still those wide and watchful eyes , the curving mouth with its provocative mole at the corner of her upper lip . The features , the bone structure were untouched by the years that had passed , the profusion of chestnut hair still youthful . He felt his face freeze . He could not smile . As though he were a gun dog pointing at a bird , the quality of his stillness , his silence , obscurely reached the others . Their attention wandered , their voices died away . Vi turned her head . " Pandora . " The church and its affairs were abandoned . She moved away from Virginia \'s side , across the polished parquet , her back view erect ,           its strap from her elbow . " Pandora , my dearest child . What a joy . What a delight to see you again . " .. but Isobel , you ca n\'t possibly have us all for dinner . That \'s far too many . " " No . If my counting \'s right , we \'ll be eleven . That \'s only one more than we are now . " " Has Verena not lumbered you with people to stay ? " " Just one man . p241 Pandora chipped in . " He \'s known as The Sad American , \' because Isobel ca n\'t remember what his name is . " " Poor chap , " said Archie from the head of the table . " Sounds as though he \'s doomed before he \'s even arrived . " " Why is he sad ? " asked Edmund , reaching for his glass of lager . At Croy , wine was never served at luncheon . This was not for any reason of parsimony but because of a family tradition , going back to Archie \'s           it because he thought it a sound idea . Wine was apt to render guests both garrulous and comatose , and Sunday afternoons , in his opinion , were made to be spent in useful outdoor activities , not snoozing over the newspapers in some armchair . " He probably is n\'t sad at all , " Isobel told him . " He \'s probably a very sensible , cheerful fellow , but he \'s been recently widowed and he \'s taken a couple of months off , and has come over here for a bit of a break . " " Does Verena know him ? " " No . But Katy does . She felt sorry for him and asked Verena to send him an invitation . " Pandora said , " I do hope he \'s not dreadfully solemn and sincere . You know how they can be . Show them round a sewage works and they \'ll go into polite ecstasies . Swearing it was all very very interesting , and wanting to know when it was built . " Archie laughed . " Pandora ,           sewage works ? " " Oh , darling , never . Just giving a tiny example . " They sat around the dining-room table . The tender roast beef , perfectly cooked and pink in the middle , had been appreciatively consumed , along with fresh beans , fresh peas , roasted potatoes , horseradish sauce , and dark gravy delicately laced with red wine . Now they were onto Isobel \'s blackberry fool and hot-syrup tart , drooling with fresh cream . Out of doors , the day , like a fickle woman , had ceased to sulk and decided , for no obvious reason , to brighten up . A wind had risen , freshening the air . From time to time , lozenges of sunlight fell upon the polished table , sparking from silver and cut-glass tumblers . " Well , if we all come to dinner , " Virginia firmly led the conversation back to essentials , " you must let me help . I \'ll make a starter , or a pudding , or something . " " That would help , " Isobel admitted           \'m going to be up at Corriehill helping Verena with the flowers . " " But that \'s my birthday . " Vi was quite indignant . " That \'s the day of my picnic . " 242 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p242 " I know , Vi , and I \'m sorry , but for the first time in years I \'m not going to be able to be there . " " Well , I hope nobody else is going to back out . You have n\'t got to go and do flowers , have you , Virginia ? " " No . I \'ve just been asked to lend my biggest flowerpots and vases . But I can take them all up to Corriehill on Wednesday . " " When does Alexa arrive ? " Lucilla asked . " On Thursday morning . She and Noel are going to drive overnight . Noel ca n\'t get off before that . And of course they \'re bringing Alexa \'s dog . So they \'ll all be at the picnic , Vi . " " I shall have to start writing           I shall lose count and produce far too much food or too little . " She leaned forward and looked down the length of the table to catch Henry \'s eye . Henry \'s expression was gloomy . He did not like people talking about Vi \'s birthday when they all knew he would not be there . She said , " I shall post two huge slices of birthday cake over to Templehall . One for Henry and one for Hamish . " " Well , make sure it \'s a cake that does n\'t go squishy . " Hamish scraped the last spoonful of syrup tart out of his plate . " Mum sent me a cake once and all the cream oozed out through the parcel , and Matron was livid . She threw the whole lot into the Sick Bay dustbin . " " Mean old Matron , " said Pandora sympathetically . " She \'s a cow . Mum , can I have some more ? " " Yes , but hand it round first . " Hamish got to his feet and went to           said , " We have a small problem . " Everybody looked at her , interested to know what it was but not particularly concerned . " Jeff has n\'t got anything to wear . To the dance , I mean . " Eyes were now turned on Jeff , who had sat through the meal without taking much part in any conversation . He looked faintly abashed and seemed pleased for the diversion of Hamish arriving at his side with the offer of second helpings of pudding . He turned to dip the spoon into what remained of the blackberry fool . He said , " When I left Australia I never thought I \'d be asked to a formal do . Besides , there was n\'t space in my backpack for a dinner jacket . " They all considered the problem . Archie said , " I \'d lend you mine , only I \'m wearing it myself . " " Dad , yours would n\'t even go round Jeff . " " He could always hire one . There are places in Relkirk ... " " Oh           Archie was humbled . " Sorry . I would n\'t know . " Across the table , Edmund eyed the young Australian . " You \'re about the same size as I am . I \'ll lend you something if you like . " Violet , hearing this , was taken aback . Sitting next to her son , she turned her head to look at him . He seemed unaware of her piercing regard , and his profile , composed and unsmiling , gave nothing away . Trying to analyze her un-motherly astonishment , she realized that the truth of it was that she had never expected Edmund to come up with such a kindly and impetuous suggestion . But why ? He was her son , the child of Geordie . She knew that where important issues were concerned he would never be anything but gener-ous -- with both time and money -- concerned and considerate . Violet could turn to him -- and had done so many times -- knowing that he would go to endless trouble to sort out a problem or help her make a           , the small gesture , the tender word , the trivial gift that had cost nothing but a few pence and a moment of time , but was significant because of the thought behind it . Her eyes strayed across the table to Virginia and the heavy gold bracelet that she wore around her wrist . Edmund had given her that bracelet -- and Violet did not like to think what it had cost -- like a tube of glue , to patch up their disagreement . But how much better had they not quarrelled in the first place , and so spared themselves weeks of unhappiness . And now he was offering Lucilla \'s Jeff a favour . It would be no hardship to him , but the offer had been made so spontaneously that Violet was reminded of Geordie . Which should have filled her with pleasure , but instead left her sad because she could not remember when she had last looked at Edmund and recognized any characteristic inherited from his gentle father . As for Jeff , he seemed as disconcerted as she was herself .           just hire something . " " No skin off my nose . I \'ve some spare things at Balnaid . You can try them on , see how they fit . " " But wo n\'t you need them yourself ? " " I shall be decked out , like the man on a shortbread tin , in my kilt . " Lucilla , however , was deeply grateful . " You are a saint , Edmund . What a relief . Now all I have to do is find some garment to wear . " " Isobel and I are going shopping for finery in Relkirk , " Pandora told her . " Why do n\'t you come too ? " Lucilla , surprising everybody , said , " I \'d love to . " But their surprise was short-lived . " There \'s a wonderful market in Relkirk , and a stall 244 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p244 stuffed with glorious nineteen-thirties tat . I \'m sure I \'ll find something there . " " Yes , " said her mother . " I am quite sure that you will           You \'ve bashed me right into the rhododen-drons . " " I wanted to get you out of the way . " " You did n\'t need to hit me quite so far . " " Yes , I did . You \'re far too cunning a player to be left jostling around the hoop . Now , Virginia , you need to come just here . " " Which blade of grass did you have in mind ? " Isobel \'s lunch party , with coffee drunk , had amicably dispersed . The boys , abandoning Scalectrix , had gone to play in Hamish \'s tree-house , and swing on his trapeze . Isobel had taken Vi to look at her border . : . not as grand or imposing as it had been in the old days but still something that she was always quite proud to show off and have admired . Archie , Virginia , Lucilla , and Jeff had decided to take advantage of Ham-ish \'s labour and were engaged in a needle contest of croquet . Edmund and Pandora sat in the old swing-seat           . It had turned into a pleasant and blowy afternoon . Clouds , in layers , drifted across the sky , but there were wide patches of blue in between , and when the sun shone , it became very warm . Despite this , Pandora , on her way out into the garden , had collected from the cloakroom an old shooting jacket of Archie \'s , oiled khaki and lined with hairy tweed . Bundled in this garment , she sat with her legs tucked up beneath her . From time to time Edmund gave a push with his foot to set the old seat swinging . It needed to be oiled and made a hideous squeaking sound . A wail from the middle of the rhododendrons . " I ca n\'t find the beastly ball and I \'ve been scratched by a bramble . " " In a moment , " Edmund observed , " family fur is going to fly . " " It always did . It \'s a lethal game . " They fell silent , rocking gently to and fro . Virginia took           least four yards beyond the spot that Archie had been indicating . " Oh , sorry , Archie . " " You hit it too hard . " p245 " Nothing , " said Edmund , " is so obvious as the obvious remark . " Pandora made no comment . Squeak , squeak went the swing . They watched in silence while Jeff played his shot . She said , " Do you hate me , Edmund ? " " No . " " But you despise me ? Think little of me ? " " Why should I do that ? " " Because I made such a mess of everything . Running off with another woman \'s husband , and he old enough to be my father . Leaving no word of explanation , breaking my parents \' hearts , never coming back . Sending waves of shock and horror to reverberate around the county . " " Is that what happened ? " " You know it is . " " I was n\'t here at the time . " " Of course . You were           you went flying off . " " I was miserable . I did n\'t know what to do with my life . Archie had gone and was married to Isobel , and I missed him . There did n\'t seem to be any way to turn . And then along came a little diversion , and it all seemed frightfully glamorous and grown-up . Exciting . My ego needed a boost and that \'s what he provided . " " How did you meet him ? " " Oh , at some party . He had a horse-faced wife called Gloria , but she scarpered pretty sharpish as soon as she saw the way the wind was blowing . Went off to Marbella and never returned . Which was another reason for eloping to California . " Lucilla , with bits of leaf in her hair , emerged from the rhododendrons and rejoined the game . " Who \'s been through the hoop , and who has n\'t ? " The seat , gradually , stopped swinging . Edmund gave another push and started it up again . Squeak ,           " " Yes . " " I do n\'t think I was ever happy . " " I \'m sorry . " " I liked being rich but I was n\'t happy . I was homesick and I missed the dogs . Do you know what he was called , the man I ran away with ? " " I do n\'t think I was ever told . " " Harold Hogg . Can you imagine anybody eloping with a man called Harold Hogg ? After our divorce , the first thing I did was to change my name back to Blair . So I did n\'t keep his name , but I did keep much of his money . So lucky , to be divorced in California . " 246 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p246 Edmund said nothing . " And then , when it was all over , and after I \'d changed my name back to Blair , do you know what I did ? " " I have no idea . " " I went to New York . I \'d never been there before , did n\'t           hotel I could find and then I walked down Fifth Avenue and knew that anything I wanted I could buy . For myself . And then I did n\'t buy anything . That \'s a sort of happiness , is n\'t it , Edmund ? Knowing that you can buy anything you want and then discovering that you do n\'t want it . " " Are you happy now ? " " I \'m home . " " Why did you come back ? " " Oh , I do n\'t know . Reasons . Lucilla and Jeff were there to drive me . I wanted to see Archie again . And then , of course , the irresistible lure of Verena Steynton \'s party . " " I have a feeling that Verena Steynton has little to do with it . " " Perhaps . But it \'s a nice excuse . " " You never came home when your parents died . " " That was unforgivable , was n\'t it ? " " You said it , Pandora . I did n\'t . " " I was           . I could n\'t face funerals , graves , condolences . I could n\'t face anybody . And death is so final , just as youth is so sweet . I could n\'t bear to accept that it was all over . " " Are you happy in Majorca ? " " I \'m home there too . All these years , and the Casa Rosa is the first home I \'ve actually owned . " " Are you going back ? " All the time they had been talking , they had not looked at each other . Instead , they had watched , with patent intent , the croquet players . But now he turned to face her , and her head came around , and her remarkable eyes , fringed with thick black lashes , stared into his own . Perhaps it was because she had become so painfully thin , but they seemed to Edmund more enormous and lustrous than they had ever been . She said , " Why do you ask ? " " I do n\'t know . " " Perhaps I do           on the faded striped cushions and returned her attention to the croquet . Their conversation , such as it was , appeared to be over . Edmund watched his wife . She stood in the middle of the verdant lawn , leaning on her mallet , while Jeff lined up to play a tricky shot . p247 She wore a checked shirt and a short blue denim skirt , and her legs were long and bare and brown , and her canvas sneakers very white . Fit , slender , bursting into laughter at Jeff \'s abortive attempt to get his ball through the hoop , she radiated the sort of vitality that Edmund associated with glossy magazine advertisements for sports clothes , Rolex watches , or sun-tan oil . Virginia . My love , he told himself . My life . But for some reason the words were empty as incantations that were never going to work , and he found himself racked by despair . Pandora had fallen silent . He could not imagine what she thought about . He turned to look at her and it took           fast asleep . So much for his entertaining company . He was torn between chagrin and amusement , and this healthy reaction to her perfidy served to fend off for the time being the deadly sensation that he had come to the end of his rope . p248 Monday the Twelfth MONDAY WAS ONE OF EDIE \'S MORNINGS for helping Virginia at Balnaid , and Virginia was grateful for this arrangement . She had never relished Mondays , with the weekend over and Edmund gone from her once more , dressed in his city suit , and leaving the house at eight o\'clock in order to get into Edinburgh and his office before the worst of the rushhour traffic . His departure left an emptiness , a flatness , a sense of anticlimax , and it was always something of an effort to get down to day-to-day living again and cope with all the tedious demands of simply keeping the house going . But hearing the bang of the back door as Edie let herself in always made everything , instantly , a bit more bearable . To know that           , someone to laugh with , someone to dust the library and vacuum the dog hairs off the hall carpet . The clatter from the kitchen was comforting . Edie , dealing with the breakfast dishes , loading the washing-machine with a weekend \'s worth of dirty clothes , and talking to the dogs . " Now do n\'t you get under my feet , or you \'ll get your tail trodden on . " Virginia , in her bedroom , changed the sheets on their big double bed , her regular Monday-morning chore . Henry had gone shopping . His mother had given him five pounds , and he had set off to the village , to visit Mrs. Ishak , and buy the allotted amount of sweets , chocolates , and biscuits that he was permitted to take to Templehall in his tuck-box , and which were meant to last him for a full term . He had never before been given so much money to spend on sweets , and the novelty of this , for the moment , had diverted his attention from the fact that           Eight years old and going away . Not for ever , it was true . But Virginia knew that when she saw him again , he would already be a different Henry because he would have seen things p249 and done things and learned things totally dissociated from his mother \'s life . Tomorrow , he was going . The first day of ten years of regular separation from his parents and his home . The beginning of his growing up . Up and away from her . She folded pillowcases . They had only another twenty-four hours . All through the weekend she had resolutely put his inevitable departure out of her mind ; pretended to herself that Tuesday was never going to happen . Henry , she guessed , had done the same , and her heart bled for his innocence . Last night , saying good night to him , she had steeled herself for a dam-burst of tears and lamentations . The weekend \'s over . Our last weekend . I do n\'t want to go to school . I do n\'t want to leave you           quite liked playing with Hamish , he \'d hung by one leg from Hamish \'s trapeze ; and then , worn out by the day \'s activity , had fallen almost instantly asleep . She spread crisp , ironed sheets . I \'ll get through today and make it fun for him , she told herself . And then , somehow , I \'ll get through tomorrow . After Edmund has taken Henry , after they \'ve driven away and I ca n\'t hear the car any longer , I \'ll think of something diverting or industrious to do . I \'ll go and see Dermot Honeycombe and spend hours looking for a present for Katy Steynton . A bit of china , or an antique lamp , or perhaps a little piece of Georgian silver . I \'ll write a long letter to Gramps and Grandma . I \'ll turn out the linen cupboard , sew buttons on Edmund \'s shirts . . , . And then Edmund will come home , and after that the worst will be over , and I can start counting the days until           soiled sheets and flung them out onto the landing , then put away a few random clothes and shoes , straightened a cushion . The telephone rang . She went to answer it , sitting on the edge of the freshly made bed . " Balnaid . " " Virginia . " It was Edmund . At a quarter past nine in the morning ? " Are you in the office ? " " Yes . Got here ten minutes ago . Virginia . Look . I have to go to New York . " She was not particularly perturbed . His flying off to New York was a regular occurrence . " When ? " " Now . Today . I \'m catching the first shuttle down to London . Flying out of Heathrow this afternoon . " " But ? " 250 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p250 " I \'ll be back at Balnaid on Friday in time for the party . Probably about six in the evening . Earlier if I can make it . " " You mean ... " It was difficult actually to take in what           be away all week ? " " That \'s right . " " But ... packing . . clothes . . . " Which was ridiculous because she knew that he kept a duplicate wardrobe in the flat at Moray Place , with suits , shirts , and underclothes suitable for any capital and any cli-mate . " I \'ll do that here . " " But ... " The implication , the truth of what he was saying , broke at last . He ca n\'t do this to me . The bedroom window was open and the air that flowed through it was not cold , but Virginia , hunched over the telephone , shivered . She saw the knuckles of her hand , clenched around the receiver , grow white . " Tomorrow , " she said . " Tuesday . You \'re taking Henry to Templehall . " " I ca n\'t do that . " " You promised . " " I have to go to New York . " " Somebody else can go . Not you . " " There \'s nobody else           has to be me . " " But you promised . You said that you would take Henry . I told you that it was the one thing that I would n\'t do . It was my condition and you accepted it . " " I know , and I \'m sorry . But what \'s happened is beyond my control . " " Send somebody else to New York . You \'re the boss . Send some under-ling . " " It \'s because I am who I am that I have to go . " " You are who you are ! " She heard her own voice , shrill with scathing . " Edmund Aird . You think of nobody but yourself and nothing but your hateful job . Sanford Cubben . I hate Sanford Cubben . I realize I come fairly low on your priority list , but I thought Henry rated a little higher . You did n\'t only promise me , you promised Henry . Does that mean nothing to you ? " " I did n\'t promise anything . I just said that           . " " I call that a commitment . If you made such a commitment in business , you \'d kill yourself to see it through . " " Virginia , be reasonable . " " I will not be reasonable ! I will not sit here and listen to you and be told to be reasonable . And I will not deliver my child to a boarding- p251 school that I never wanted him to go to in the first place . It \'s like asking me to take one of the dogs to the vet to be put down . I wo n\'t do it ! " By now she was sounding like a fishwife , and did not care . But Ed-mund \'s voice remained , as always , infuriatingly cool and dispassionate . " In that case , I suggest that you call Isobel Balmerino and ask her to take Henry . She \'s driving Hamish . She \'ll have plenty of space for Henry . " " If you think I \'m going to palm Henry off onto Isobel ? " " Then you \'ll           a bastard , Edmund . You know that , do n\'t you ? You \'re behaving like a selfish bastard . " " Where is Henry ? I \'d like to speak to him before I go . " " He \'s not here , " Virginia told him with a certain malicious satisfaction . " He \'s buying his sweets from Mrs. Ishak . " " Well , when he comes home , tell him to ring me at the office . " " You can ring him yourself . " And on this biting exit line , she slammed down the receiver and put an end to the miserable exchange . Her raised voice had penetrated to the kitchen . " What was that all about ? " Edie asked , turning from the sink as Virginia stormed in with a face like thunder , and arms filled with rumpled linen , to stride across the kitchen towards the open door of the utility room and hurl her burden in the general direction of the washing-ma-chine . " Is something wrong ? " " Everything . " Virginia           and her expression mutinous . " That was Edmund , and he \'s going to New York today . Now . And he \'s going to be away a week , and he promised me .. he promised , Edie . . . that he \'d drive Henry to school tomorrow . I told him that it was the one thing I would n\'t do . I \'ve hated the whole idea of Templehall from the very beginning , and the only reason I finally relented was because Edmund promised that he would take Henry tomor-row . " Edie knew a nasty temper when she saw one . She said reasonably , " Well , I suppose if you \'re an important business man these things are bound to happen . " " Only to Edmund . Other men manage their lives without being so bloody selfish . " " You do n\'t want to take Henry yourself ? " " No , I do not . It \'s the last thing in the world I want to do . It \'s inhuman of Edmund to expect it of me           the problem . p252 " Could you not ask Lady Balmerino to take him with Hamish ? " Virginia did not let on that Edmund had already made this sensible suggestion and got an earful for his pains . " I do n\'t know . " She thought about it . " I suppose I could , " she admitted sulkily . " Isobel \'s very understanding . And she \'s been through it herself . " " No , she has n\'t . " It was obvious to Edie that she could say nothing right . " Hamish was never like Henry . You could send Hamish to the moon , and all he \'d worry about would be when he was going to get his next meal . " " That \'s true enough . But if I were you , I \'d have a word with Isobel . It \'s no good working yourself up into a state if there \'s nothing to be done . What ? " " I know , Edie . What ca n\'t be cured must be endured . " " That           went to get the kettle and fill it with water . A cup of tea seemed to be in order . There was nothing , in times of stress , like a good hot cup of tea . They were drinking the tea when Henry returned , his carrier-bag bulging with goodies . " Mummy , look what I got ! " He emptied the contents out onto the kitchen table . " Look , Edie . Mars Bars , and Smarties , and Cadbury \'s Dairy Milk , and some Jellybabies , and Jaffa Cakes , and Chocolate Digestives , and treacle toffees , and Rolos ; and Mrs. Ishak gave me a lollipop for going away . I did n\'t have to pay for the lollipop , so can I eat it now ? " Edie surveyed his loot . " I hope you \'re not going to eat that lot all at once , otherwise you wo n\'t have a tooth left in your head . " " No . " He was already unwrapping the lollipop . " It \'s got to last a long time           . She put her arm around Henry and said , in consciously cheerful tones , " Daddy phoned . " He licked . " What about ? " " He has to go to America . Today . He \'s flying from London this afternoon . So he wo n\'t be able to take you to school tomorrow . But I thought I \'d ... " Henry stopped licking . His pleasure flowed from his face , and he turned enormous , apprehensive eyes upon his mother . She hesitated , and then started up again . " . . . I thought I \'d ring Isobel and ask if she \'d take you with Hamish .. She got no further . His reaction to the news was even worse than she had dreaded . A wail of dismay and floods of instant tears . . . " I do n\'t want Isobel to take me. ... " p253 " Henry . . He jerked himself out of her embrace and flung his lollipop onto the floor . " I \'m not going to go with Isobel and Hamish .           . How would you like it , if you were me and ... " " Henry . . . " " ... you had to go away with people who were n\'t your own mother and father ? I think you are being very unkind to me .... " " I \'ll take you . " " And Hamish will be horrid and not talk because he \'s a senior . It \'s not fair ! " Furiously weeping , he turned and fled for the door . " Henry , I \'ll take you . . . . " But he was gone , his footsteps stamping up the stairs to the sanctuary of his bedroom . Virginia , gritting her teeth , closed her eyes and wished that she could close her ears as well . It came . The deadly slam of his bedroom door . Then silence . She opened her eyes and met Edie \'s across the table . Edie gave a long sigh . She said , " Oh , dearie dear . " " So much for that bright idea . " "           leaned her elbow on the table and ran a hand through her hair . All at once the situation had become more than she felt able to cope with . She said , " This is the very last thing I wanted to happen . " She knew , and Edie knew , that Henry \'s tantrums , though rare , left him vulnerable and touchy for hours . " I wanted this to be a good day , and not miserable . Our last day together . And now Henry \'s going to spend it bursting into tears and blaming me for everything . As if things were n\'t bad enough . Damn Edmund . What am I going to do , Edie ? " " How would it be , " said Edie , " if I just came back this afternoon and took Henry off your hands ? He \'s never so bad with me . Have you finished his packing yet ? Well , I could finish his packing and do any wee bits that need to be done , and he can just be around           quiet day , that \'s what he needs . " " Oh , Edie . " Virginia was filled with grateful love . " Would you do that ? " " No trouble . Mind , I \'ll have to go home and see to Lottie , give her her dinner , but I \'ll be here again by two . " " Ca n\'t Lottie see to her own dinner ? " " Well , she can , but she makes such a hash of it , burns the pans , and leaves my kitchen in a midden , I \'m better to do it myself . " 254 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p254 Virginia was repentant . " Oh , Edie . You do so much . I \'m sorry I shouted at you . " " Good thing I was here for you to shout at . " She heaved herself onto her swollen legs . " Now , I must get on , or we wo n\'t get the baby bathed at this rate . Up you go and have a word with Henry . Tell him he           \'d really like would be one of his bonny pictures . " Virginia found Henry , as she knew she would , under his duvet with Moo . She said , " I \'m sorry , Henry . " Racked with huge sobs , he did not reply . She sat on his bed . " It was a silly thing to suggest . Daddy suggested it to me , and I thought it was silly then . I had no right even to mention it to you . Of course you wo n\'t go with Isobel . You \'ll come with me . I \'ll take you in the car . " She waited . After a bit , Henry rolled onto his back . His face was swollen and tear-stained , but he seemed to have stopped crying . He said , " I do n\'t mind so much about Hamish , but I want you . " " I \'ll be there . Perhaps we \'ll take Hamish with us . It would be kind . Save Isobel a journey . " He sniffed . " All           . She said she \'d like to spend the afternoon with you . She wants you to draw her a picture . " " Have you packed my felt pens ? " " Not yet . " He put out his arms , and she gathered him up and held him close , rocking him gently , pressing kisses onto the top of his head . After a bit , he emerged from beneath his duvet , and they found a handkerchief and he blew his nose . It was not until then that she remembered Edmund \'s message . " Daddy wanted you to ring him up . He \'s at the office . You know the number . " Henry went to her bedroom to do this , but Virginia had left it too late and Edmund had already gone . The playroom was peaceful and warm . Sun poured through the wide windows , and the breeze sent the wistaria branches tapping at the panes . Henry sat at the big table in the middle of the room , and drew . Edie was on the window-seat           p255 socks . In the mornings , for work , Edie wore her oldest clothes and a pinafore , but this afternoon she had turned up looking quite smart , and had put on her new lilac cardigan . Henry felt flattered , because he knew that she was keeping it for best . As soon as she arrived , she had set up the ironing-board , and ironed the morning \'s load of washing , fresh from the line . This was now stacked , crisp and folded , on the other end of the table , and emanated a pleasant smell . Henry laid down his felt pen and searched in his pen-box , making scrabbling sounds . He said , " Bother . " " What is it , pet ? " " I want a Biro . I \'ve drawn people with balloons coming out of their mouths , and I want to write what they \'re saying . " " Look in Edie \'s bag . There \'s a pen in there . " Her bag was on the chair by the fireside . It           important things : her comb , her fat housekeeping purse , her Old Age Pension book , her Post Office Savings book , her rail-card , her bus pass . She did n\'t have a car , so she had to go everywhere by bus . Because of this she had a timetable , a little booklet , " Relkirkshire Bus Company . " Henry , rooting for the pen , came upon this . It occurred to him , out of the blue , that it might be a sensible and useful thing to own . Edie probably had another at home . He looked up at Edie . She was intent on her sewing , her white head bowed . He removed the booklet from her bag and slipped it into the pocket of his jeans . He found the Biro , closed her bag , and went back to his work . Presently , Edie asked , " What would you like for your tea ? " He said , " Macaroni cheese . " Dermot Honeycombe \'s antique shop stood at the far end of the           and at the foot of a gentle slope that leaned between the road and the river . Once it had been the village smithy , and the cottage where Dermot lived , the blacksmith \'s house . Dermot \'s cottage was painfully picturesque . It had tubs of begonias at the door , latticed windows , and a thickly thatched roof . But the shop was much as it had always been , with walls of dark stone and blackened beams . Outside was a yard of cobbles where once the patient farm horses had stood , waiting to be shod , and here Dermot had set up his shop sign , p256 an aged wooden cart , painted blue , with DERMOT HONEYCOMBE ANTIQUES emblazoned tastefully on its side . It was an eye-catching gimmick , and brought in much casual trade . It was also useful for tying dogs to . Virginia clipped the leads onto the spaniels \' collars , and knotted the ends around one of the cartwheels . The dogs sat , looking reproachful . " I sha n\'t be long , " she told           eyes made her feel like a murderer , but she left them and went across the cobbles and in through the door of the old smithy . Here Dermot sat , in his paper-piled birdcage of an office . He was on the telephone but spied her through the glass , raised a hand , and then reached out to turn on a switch . Within the shop , four dangling bulbs sprang to light , doing a little to alleviate the gloom , but not very much . The place bulged with every sort of junk . Chairs were piled on tables , on the tops of chests of drawers . Huge wardrobes towered . There were milk churns , jelly pans , stacks of unmatched china , brass fenders , corner cupboards , curtain rails , cushions , bundles of velvet , threadbare rugs . The smell was damp and musty , and Virginia knew a small frisson of anticipation . Visits to Dermot \'s were always something of a lottery because you never knew -- and neither did Dermot -- what you might , by chance ,           between the tottering stacks of furniture , with the wary caution of a pot-holer . Already , she felt marginally more cheerful . Browsing was a comforting therapy , and Virginia allowed herself the self-indulgence of putting Edmund , the morning \'s traumas , and tomorrow , all out of her mind . A present for Katy . Her eye wandered . She priced a chest of drawers , a wide-lapped chair . Searched for the silver mark on a battered spoon , poked through a box of old keys and brass doorknobs , turned the pages of a dignified old wreck of a book . Found a lustre cream jug , and wiped the dust from it , searching for chips or cracks . There were none . She was joined by Dermot , finished with his telephone call . " Hello , my dear . " " Dermot . Hello . " " Looking for something in particular ? " " A present for Katy Steynton . " She held up the lustre jug . " This is sweet . " " It \'s a pet , is           that dark gentian blue . " He was a rotund , smooth-faced man of mature years , but strangely ageless . His cheeks were pink , and his fluffy pale hair airy as dandelion down . He wore a faded green corduroy jacket , much adorned with drooping poachers \' pockets , and had a red-spotted kerchief tied in a p257 jaunty knot around his neck . " You \'re the second person I \'ve had in today looking for something for Katy . " " Who else has been here ? " " Pandora Blair . Popped in this morning . Lovely to see her again . Could n\'t believe it when she walked through the door . Just like old times . And after all these years ! " " We had lunch at Croy yesterday . " Virginia thought about yesterday , and knew that it had been a good day , the sort they would all remember when they were old and there was nothing much left to do but reminisce . It was the time when Pandora came home from Majorca , and Lucilla was           name . And we played croquet . And Edmund and Pandora sat in the swing seat , and Pandora went to sleep , and we all teased Edmund for being such a boring companion . " That \'s the first time I \'d met Pandora . " " Of course . Amazing . How the years fly by . " " What did she buy for Katy ? I must n\'t get the same . " " A lamp . Chinese porcelain , and I \'d made the shade for it myself . White silk , lined in palest pink . Then we had a cup of coffee and caught up on all the news . She was ever so sad when I told her about Terence . " " I \'m sure . " Virginia was afraid that Dermot \'s eyes were about to swim with tears , and went on hurriedly , " Dermot , I think I \'ll have this jug . Katy can use it either for cream or flowers , yet it \'s pretty enough on its own . " " Do n\'t think you           . Have a snoop around . . . " I \'d love to , but I \'m taking the dogs for a walk . I \'ll pick the jug up on my way home , and write you a cheque for it then . " " Righty ho . " He took the jug from her and led the devious way back towards the door . " Are you going to Vi \'s picnic on Thursday ? " " Yes . Alexa will be there too . She \'s bringing a friend up for the dance . " " Oh , lovely . Have n\'t seen Alexa for months . I \'m going to see if I can get someone to mind the shop for me that day . If I ca n\'t , I \'ll shut it up . Would n\'t miss Vi \'s picnic for anything . " " I hope it \'s a good day . " They emerged and stepped out into the sunshine . The dogs , spying them , wheaked blissfully and leaped to their feet , tangling the leads . " How \'s           to New York . " " I do n\'t believe it ! What a thing ! I would n\'t have his job for all the tea in China . " " Do n\'t waste your sympathy . He loves it . " i p258 She rescued the dogs , waved goodbye to Dermot , walked on , leaving the last straggling cottages of Strathcroy behind her . Another half mile and she had come to the bridge that spanned the river at the west end of the village . The bridge was ancient , steeply humpbacked , and once used by cattle-drovers . On the far side , a winding , tree-shaded lane followed the convolutions of the river , and led the way back to Balnaid . On the crest of the bridge she paused to loosen the dogs and let them run free . They shot off at once , noses enticed by the smell of rabbits , to plunge into a thicket of bracken and brambles . Every now and then , as though to prove they were not wasting their time , they made hunting calls           with ears flying like furry wings . Virginia let them go . They were Edmund \'s gun dogs , patiently trained , intelligent and obedient . A single whistle and they would return to her . The old bridge was a pleasant spot to loiter . The stone wall felt warm in the sunshine , and she leaned her arms on this and gazed downwards at the flowing peat-brown water . Sometimes she and Henry played Poohsticks from this bridge , flinging sticks upstream and then racing back to watch for the first , the winning stick , to appear . Sometimes the sticks never did appear , having been caught up in some unseen obstruction . Like Edmund . Alone , with only the river for company , she felt strong enough to think about Edmund , by now probably winging his way over the Atlantic towards New York , drawn , as though by a magnet , away from his wife and his son , just at a time when he was most needed at home . The magnet was his work , and right now Virginia felt           gone to keep an assignation with a mistress . Which was strange because she had never been jealous of other women , never tortured herself with imaginings of infidelity during the long periods when Edmund was away from her , in far-flung cities on the other side of the world . Once , teasing , she had told him that she did n\'t care what he did , provided she was n\'t expected to watch . All that mattered was that he always came home . But today , she had slammed down the telephone receiver and never said goodbye , and then forgotten , until too late , to give Henry his father \'s message . Experiencing a twinge of guilt , she gathered her hurt feelings about her . It \'s his own fault . Let him brood . Perhaps another time he \'ll " Out for a walk , are you ? " The voice came from nowhere . Virginia thought , oh , God , let a few seconds pass , and then slowly turned . Lottie stood only a few feet away . She had           , the way that p259 Virginia had , soft-footed , unheard . Had she seen Virginia in the street , watching from Edie \'s window , reached for her horrible beret , her green cardigan , and followed ? Had she been waiting while Virginia was with Dermot , ducking out of sight and then dogging Virginia \'s footsteps , always just out of earshot ? The very idea was spooky . What did she want ? Why could she not leave people alone ? And why , beyond Virginia \'s irritation , lurked , like a ghost , a sense of presentiment , a foreboding of fear ? Ridiculous . She pulled herself together . Imagination . It was only Edie \'s cousin , avid for company . With some effort , Virginia put a friendly expression on her face . " What are you doing here , Lottie ? " " Fresh air belongs to everybody , I always say . Looking at the water ? " She moved to Virginia \'s side , to lean over the wall as she had been doing . But she was           , and crane her neck . " Seen any fish ? " " I was n\'t looking for fish . " " Been to Mr. Honeycombe \'s , have n\'t you ? Lot of rubbish he \'s got in there . Most of it only fit for a bonfire . But then , there \'s no accounting for tastes . And as for what I \'m doing , I \'m out for a walk , same as you . On your own , Edie tells me over dinner . Edmund gone to America . " " Just for a few days . " " That \'s not so nice . On business , is he ? " " He would n\'t go for any other reason . " " Oh , ho , ho , that \'s what you think . Saw Pandora Blair this morning . Thin , is n\'t she ? Like a scarecrow . And that hair ! Looks like dyed to me . Called out to her but she did n\'t see me . Had dark glasses on . Could have had a good old chin-wag           , you know , resident housemaid . Old Lady Balmerino then . She was a lovely lady . Felt sorry for her , with a daughter no better than she should be . That was the time of the wedding . Lord and Lady Balmerino , but they were Archie and Isobel then . There was a dance at Croy the evening of the wedding . What a work . So many people staying you could n\'t turn round . Course , Mrs. Harris was cook , old Lady Balmerino did n\'t have to cook . There were some fine goings-on , but no doubt you \'ve been told . " " Yes , " said Virginia , and tried to think of some way in which she could escape this unwelcome flood of words . " Scarcely out of school she was , Pandora , but she knew a thing or two , I can tell you . Men . She \'d eat them for breakfast , and leave them chewed . A right wee whore . " She was smiling , her tones inconsequent and chatty , almost           and surprised her into 260 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p260 saying , quite sharply , " Lottie , I do n\'t think you should say that about Pandora . " " Oh , you do n\'t ? " Lottie was still smiling . " Not pleasant , is it , hearing the truth ? Nice Pandora \'s back , everybody is saying . But if I were you , I would n\'t be too happy . Not with your husband . Not with her . Lovers they were , Edmund and Pandora . That \'s why she \'s back , mark my words . Come back for him . Eighteen years old , and Edmund a married man and the father of a wee bairn , but that did n\'t stop them . That did n\'t stop him , rutting in her own bed . Night of the wedding it was , and everybody dancing . But they were n\'t dancing . Oh , no . They were up the stair and thinking nobody noticed . But I noticed . Not much missed me . " Pink spots burned on Lottie \'s           of nails , hammered into the sockets of her head . " I went after them . Stood at the door . It was dark . I heard . Never heard anything like it . You did n\'t guess , did you ? He \'s a cool fish , that Edmund . Never let on . Never say a word . Just like the rest of them . They all knew . Well , it was obvious , was n\'t it ? Edmund back in London and Pandora sulking in her bedroom , face swollen with tears , would n\'t eat . And the way she spoke to her mother ! But , of course , they \'re all thick as thieves . That \'s why Lady Balmerino gave me my notice . Did n\'t want me around . I knew too much . " Still smiling . Hot with excitement . Mad . I must , Virginia told herself , keep very calm . She said , " Lottie , I think you are making all this up . " Lottie \'s demeanour , with quite startling suddenness ,           smile was wiped from her face . She backed away from Virginia and stood , four-square , facing up to her as though they were about to engage in a contest of physical strength . " And why do you think your husband \'s suddenly taken himself off to America ? You ask him when he comes home to you , and I \'ll doubt you \'ll enjoy his answer . I \'m sorry for you , do you know that ? Because he \'ll make a fool of you , same as he did his first wife , poor lady . There \'s no streak of decency in him . " And then , abruptly , it was over . Her venom spent , Lottie seemed to slump within herself . The colour seeped from her cheeks . She pursed her lips , brushed a scrap of lichen from the front of her cardigan , tucked a wisp of hair under her beret , patted it into place . Her expression became complacent , as though all were now well , and she was content to prink . Virginia           her head and gave a little laugh . " Ask any of them . " " You are lying . " " Say what you please . Sticks and stones may break my bones . . . " " I shall say nothing . " p261 Lottie shrugged . " In that case , what \'s all the fuss about ? " " I shall say nothing and you are lying . " Her heart was banging in her chest , her knees trembling . But she turned her back on Lottie and began to walk away ; walking steadily and without haste , knowing that Lottie watched , determined to give her no satisfaction . The worst was never looking back . Her scalp crawled with terrified apprehension , the fear that , at any moment , she would feel Lot-tie \'s weight leap upon her shoulders , dragging her to the ground with all the inhuman strength of a clawed monster from childhood nightmares . This did not happen . She reached the far bank of the river , and felt a little safer . She remembered the           but her mouth and her lips were too dry for whistling , and she had to try again . A tiny piping sound , a pathetic effort , but Edmund \'s spaniels had had enough of abortive rabbiting , and almost immediately appeared , bounding through the bracken towards her , trailed with goosegrass and with twigs of thorny bramble entwined in their feathery fur . She had never been so glad to see them , so grateful for their instant obedience . " Good dogs . " She stopped to fondle them . " Good to come . Time to go home . " They ran ahead , down the lane . Leaving the bridge behind her , Virginia went after them , her pace still resolutely unhurried . She did not allow herself to look back until she reached the bend of the river , where the lane curved away beneath the trees . There , she stopped and turned . The bridge was still visible but there was no sign of Lottie . She was gone . It was over . Virginia took a deep breath and           not far from panic . Then the panic took over , and , without shame , she bolted for home . Ran to Edie , to Henry , to the sanctuary of Balnaid . Back to the beginning . You are lying . Two o\'clock in the morning and Virginia was still awake , her eyes , scratchy with fatigue , wide open , staring out into the soft darkness . She had tossed and turned , been either too hot or too cold , fought with pillows lumpy with pummelling . From time to time , she got out of the bed , wandered about in her night-gown , fetched a glass of water , drank it , tried again to sleep . 262 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p262 It was no good . On the far side of the bed , Edmund \'s side , Henry slumbered peacefully . Virginia , defiantly breaking one of Edmund \'s strictest rules , had taken her son to bed with her . Every now and then , as though for reassurance , she put out a hand to touch him , to feel           his striped pyjamas . In the huge bed , he seemed small as a baby , scarcely alive . She \'d eat them for breakfast and leave them chewed . A right wee whore . She could not get the appalling scene out of her mind . Lottie \'s words went on and on , round and round like some scratchy old gramophone record , worn with playing . Circles of torment , never ceasing , never coming to any sort of conclusion . Lovers they were . Edmund a married man , and the father of a wee bairn . Edmund and Pandora . If it was true , Virginia knew that she had never imagined nor suspected for a single instant . In her innocence , she had not watched for evidence , had read no inner meaning into Edmund \'s casual words , his easy demeanour . " Pandora \'s home , " he had told her , pouring himself a drink and going to the refrigerator to search for ice . " We \'ve been asked for lunch at Croy . " And Virginia had said           beefburgers for Henry \'s supper . Pandora was simply Archie \'s errant young sister , back from Majorca . And when the great reunion happened , she had paid little regard to the brotherly kiss Edmund had planted on Pandora \'s cheek , their laughter , and the understandable affection of this greeting . And as for the rest of the day , Virginia had been more interested in the croquet game than curious to know what it was that Edmund and Pandora , watching from the swing seat , were talking about . And what did it matter what they talked about ? Be sensible . So what if they had had a wild and impetuous affair and ended up in Pandora \'s bed ? Pandora at eighteen must have been sensational , and Edmund at the height of his virility . This is today , and adultery is no longer called adultery but extra-marital sex . Besides , it was all a long time ago . Over twenty years . And Edmund had not been unfaithful to Virginia , but to his first wife , Caroline . And           . There was nothing to agonize over . Nothing . . . They all knew . All thick as thieves . Did n\'t want me around . I knew too much . Who knew ? Did Archie know ? Did Isobel ? Did Vi know ? And Edie ? Because if they knew , they would have been watching , fearing perhaps that it was all going to happen all over again . Watching Edmund and p263 Pandora , Watching Virginia , their eyes filled with a pity that she had never seen . Did they worry for Virginia as they must have worried for Caroline ? Did they talk amongst themselves , like conspirators , agreeing to keep the truth from Edmund \'s second wife ? Because if they had , then Virginia had been betrayed , and by the very people she was closest to and most relied upon . And why do you think your husband \'s suddenly taken himself off to America ? He \'ll make a fool of you , same as he did his first wife , poor lady . This was the worst           gone . Had he really had to fly off like that , or was New York simply a trumped-up excuse to get away from Balnaid and Virginia and to give himself time to work out his problems ? His problems being that he loved Pandora , had always loved her , and now she was back and as beautiful as ever , and Edmund was once more trapped in marriage with yet another woman , Edmund was fifty , a vulnerable age for restlessness and mid-life crises . He was not a man for showing emotion , and most of the time Virginia had no idea what he was thinking about . Her own self-doubt grew to terrifying proportions . Perhaps this time he would cut his losses and run , leaving Virginia with her marriage and her life tumbling in ruins . Leaving her and Henry lost in the rubble of what she had once thought totally impregnable . It did not bear thinking about . She rolled over , burying her face in her pillow , shutting out the ghastly prospect . She would not acknowledge it .           , Lottie . This is where we came in . Back to the beginning . p264 Tuesday the Thirteenth THE RAIN WAS CRUEL , RELENTLESS , and unwelcome . It had started before daybreak , and Virginia awoke to the sound of it , and had known a dreadful sinking of the heart . As if things were n\'t bad enough on this dreaded day , without the elements turning against her . Perhaps it would stop . But the gods were not on anybody \'s side and the downpour continued , monotonously streaming down from a charcoal-grey sky , right through the long morning and the early afternoon . Now , it was half past four , and they were on their way to Templehall . Because she had the two boys with her , and all their clobber -- trunks , tuck-boxes , duvets , rugger balls , and book-bags -- Virginia had left her own little car in the garage , and instead drove Edmund \'s Subaru , a four-wheel-drive work-horse that he used when he went into rough country , or up the hill . She           unfamiliarity and her own uncertainty only served to heighten the sense of doom and hopelessness that had dogged her for nearly twenty-four hours . Conditions were miserable . What light there had been was already seeping from the sky , and she drove with headlights on and the windscreen wipers working full tilt . Tyres hissed on flooded patches of road , and oncoming cars and lorries sent up great waves of blinding mud . Visibility was almost nil , which was frustrating , because under normal conditions , the road that led from Relkirk to Templehall was an exceptionally scenic drive -- through prosperous farmlands , alongside the banks of a wide and majestic river famous for its salmon , and past large estates , with distant glimpses of stately homes . It would have eased the atmosphere had they been able to observe any of this . Remarking on beauty spots , pointing out some distant peak would have given Virginia something to talk about . As it was , she had p265 tried engaging Hamish in lively conversation , hoping that this would divert Henry from his           . But Hamish was in a bad mood . Knowing that the freedom of summer holidays was over was bad enough , but worse was having to go back to school in the company of a new boy . A babe . That \'s what they called the little ones . The babes . Travelling with a babe was beneath Hamish \'s dignity , and he just prayed that none of his contemporaries would be around to witness his humiliating arrival . He was not going to be made responsible for Henry Aird , and had made this fact vociferously clear to his mother while she helped him lug his trunk down the stairs of Croy , and flattened , with a brush , his gruesome short haircut . Accordingly , he had decided upon a course of non-communication , and had soon put a stop to Virginia \'s advances by answering her in a series of non-committal grunts . She got the message , and after that the three of them had lapsed into a stony and wordless silence . Which made Virginia wish that she had n\'t brought           sulky son . But without him there , Henry might well have succumbed to tears , sobbed throughout the journey and arrived at Templehall sodden with weeping and in no fit state to deal with the rigours of his new and daunting future . The prospect she found almost unendurable . I am hating this , she told herself . It is even worse than I imagined it would be . It is inhuman , hellish , unnatural . And worse is to come , because the moment waits when I have to say goodbye to Henry and drive away , and leave him standing , alien and alone . I hate Templehall , and I hate the headmaster , and I could strangle Hamish Blair . I have never had to do anything in my life that I have hated so much . I am hating the rain , hating the entire educational system , hating Scotland , hating Edmund . Hamish said , " There \'s a car behind us . It wants to get past . " " Well , it can bloody wait , " Virginia           later , she was back on the same road , driving the empty vehicle in the opposite direction . It was over . Henry was gone . She felt numb . Non-existent , as though the trauma of parting from him had robbed her of all identity . Just now , she would not think about Henry , because if she did she would weep , and 266 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p266 the combination of tears , half-darkness , and relentless rain would most likely cause her to drive the Subaru off the road , or into the back of a tenton lorry . She imagined the crunch of metal , her own body flung like a broken doll to the side of the road , flashing lights , the howl of ambulances and police cars . She would not think about Henry . That part of her life was over . But what was happening to her life ? What was she doing here ? Who was she ? What was the reason for driving home to a house that stood dark and empty ? She did not want to           to Strathcroy . But where ? Somewhere perfectly gorgeous , a million miles from Archie and Isobel and Edmund and Lottie and Pandora Blair . A place of sunlight and calmness and no responsibilities , where people would tell her she was marvellous , and she could be young again instead of about a hundred years old . Leesport . That \'s it . She was driving to an airport to catch a jet to Kennedy , a limousine to Leesport . It would n\'t be raining there . It would be Long Island autumn weather , with blue skies and golden leaves and a crisp breeze blowing in over the Bay from the Atlantic . Leesport , unchanged . The wide streets , the crossroads , the hardware store and the drugstore , with the kids outside , wheeling about on their bicycles . Then , Harbor Road . Picket fences and shade trees and sprinklers out on lawns . The road sloping to the water , the yacht anchorage a coppice of masts . The gates of the country club , and then Grandma \'s house . And           in reality watching for the car so that she could be out on the sidewalk the moment it drew up . " Oh , honey , you \'re back . " The soft , wrinkled cheek , the scent of White Linen . " It \'s been too long . Did you have a good journey ? What a treat to see you ! " Indoors , and the other smells . Wood-smoke , sun oil , cedar , roses . Braided rugs and faded slip-covers . Cotton curtains blowing at open windows . And Grandpa coming in from the sundeck , with his glasses on top of his head and The New York Times under his arm ... . " Where \'s my sweetheart ? " Through the murky gloom , clusters of lights now shone ahead . Relkirk . Back to reality , and Virginia now realized that here she was going to have to stop for a little . She needed to go to the loo , freshen up . Find a bar , have a drink , be made to feel human again . She needed           . No reason to hurry home because there was nobody there to hurry to . A sort of free- p267 dom , perhaps . Nobody to care how late she was , nobody to worry about what she was doing . She drove into the old city . Cobbled streets were awash , rain shiminered in the street lights , pavements were crowded with shoppers and workers , booted , mackintoshed , carrying umbrellas and bags , all hurrying home to the comfort of their firesides and tea . She made for the King \'s Hotel because it was familiar and she knew where to find the Ladies \' . It was an old-fashioned edifice and in the middle of the town , and so had no car-park of its own . Instead , Virginia tound a space on the opposite side of the road and parked the Subaru there , beneath a dripping tree . As she locked the door , a taxi drew up outside the hotel . A man got out , wearing a raincoat and a tweed hat . He paid the driver off , and           led from the pavement to the revolving door . He disappeared . Virginia paused for traffic to pass , and then ran across the road and followed him inside . The Ladies \' was on the far side of the foyer , but the man had paused at the reception desk . He had taken off his hat and was shaking the rain trom it . " Yes ? " The receptionist was a sulky-looking girl , with fat pink lips and frizzy straw-coloured hair . " Good evening . I have a room booked . I called about a week ago , from London . " An American . His voice husky but lightly pitched . Something about it caught Virginia \'s attention , as though a hand had tugged at her sleeve . Half-way across the floor , she paused to glance at him . Saw a tall , broadshouldered back view , dark hair streaked with grey " What name did you say ? " " I did n\'t , but it \'s Conrad Tucker . " " Oh , yes . If you \'d like to           " Startled , he swung around to face her . Across the space that divided them , they stared at each other . Conrad Tucker . Older , growing grey . But Conrad . The same heavy horn-rimmed spectacles , the same indelible tan . For a second his expression remained blank , then slowly , incredulously , he smiled . " Virginia . " " I do n\'t believe this . . . . " " Well , I \'ll be god-damned . " " I thought I recognized your voice . " " What are you doing here . . . ? " 268 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p268 The boot-faced girl was not amused . " Excuse me , sir , but would you mind signing ? " " I live near here . " " I never knew " " And you. , . ? " " I \'m staying ... " " And how will you be paying , sir ? " Boot face again . " By credit card or cheque ? " " Look , " said Conrad to Virginia , " this is hopeless           in the bar and we \'ll have a drink . Can you do that ? Have you time ? " " Yes , I have time . " " I \'ll get settled , wash up , and then join you . How \'s that ? " " Five minutes . " " No more . The ladies \' room , frilled and chintzy , was mercifully empty , Virginia had shed her grotty old Barbour , been to the loo , and now stood at the mirror gazing at her own reflection , and feeling more disorientated than ever by the astonishing unexpectedness of her encounter with Conrad . Conrad Tucker , not seen nor thought of for twelve years or more . Here , in Relkirk . Come from London , and for what reason she could not imagine . She only knew that she had never been so glad to see a known face , because now , at least , she had someone to talk to . She was not dressed for socializing . Blue jeans and an old grey cashmere sweater with a muffler of           lank with rain , her face clean of make-up . She saw the lines on her forehead and at the corners of her mouth , and the dark bruises beneath her eyes , evidence of her sleepless night . She reached for her bag , found a comb , fixed her hair , fastened it back from her face with an elastic band . Conrad Tucker . Twelve years . She had been twenty-one . So long ago , and so much , since , had taken place , that it took some effort to recall the details of that particular summer . But they had met at the country club in Leesport . Conrad was a lawyer , in business in New York with his uncle . He had an apartment in the East Fifties , but his father owned an old house in South- p269 ampton , and Conrad had come from there to Leesport to play in some tennis championships . So far , so good . How had he played ? That was lost in the mists of time . Virginia simply remembered that she had           he had sought her out and bought her a drink , which was exactly what she had intended should happen . She searched in her bag , in vain , for a lipstick , but found scent and splashed it on . It had been a good summer . Conrad turned up in Leesport most weekends , and there were midnight barbecues and clambakes on the Fire Island beach . They played a lot of tennis , sailed Grandpa \'s old sloop out onto the blue waters of the Bay . She remembered Saturday nights at the club , and dancing with Conrad on the wide terrace with the sky full of stars and the band playing " The Look of Love . " Once , mid-week , she had driven up to the City with her grandmother , to stay at the Colony Club , do a bit of shopping , and take in a show . And Conrad had phoned , and taken her out to dinner at Lespleiades , and after that they had gone on to the Cafe Carlyle and stayed until the small hours listening           She picked up her bag and her Barbour and went out of the room and up the stairs and into the bar . Conrad had not yet reappeared . She bought herself a whisky and soda , a packet of cigarettes , and carried her drink to an empty table in the corner of the room . She drank half the whisky at a single go , felt at once warmed , comforted , and marginally stronger . The day was not yet over , but at least she was being offered a little respite , and she was n\'t alone any longer . She said , " You start , Conrad . " " Why me ? " " Because before I say a single word , I have to know what you \'re doing here . What has brought you to Scotland , to Relkirk ? There has to be some logical explanation , but I ca n\'t think what it is . " He smiled . " I \'m not in fact doing anything . I \'m on a long vacation . Not exactly a sabbatical ,           a lawyer in New York ? " " I am. " 270 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p270 " Working with your uncle ? " " No . I \'m the top of the heap now . " " How impressive . Go on . " " Well . . . I \'ve been away about six weeks . Travelling in England , staying with various acquaintances . Somerset , Berkshire , London . Then I came north and I \'ve been in Kelso for a few days with some distant cousins of my mother \'s . It \'s a great place . Great fishing . Left them after lunch today . Caught the train up here . " " How long are you staying in Relkirk ? " Just tonight . Tomorrow morning I \'m hiring a car , and driving on north . I have to go to a party . " " And where is the party ? " " Some place called Corriehill . But I \'m staying at another house called Croy . With ? " " I know . " Virginia interrupted . " Archie and Isobel           " Because they \'re our closest friends . We all live in the same village , Strathcroy . And . . . you know Katy Steynton ? " " I met her in London . " " You \'re the Sad American . " Virginia said this without thinking and could at once have bitten out her tongue . " Sorry ? " " No , Conrad . I \'m sorry . I should n\'t have said that . It \'s just that nobody could remember your name . That \'s why I did n\'t know it was you who was coming . " " You \'ve lost me . " " We had lunch with the Balmerinos on Sunday . Isobel told me about you then . " Conrad shook his head . I knew you \'d married and I knew you \'d married a Scotsman , but no more than that . I never imagined we \'d meet up like this . " " Well , here I am , Mrs. Edmund Aird . " At least I think I am . She hesitated . " Conrad ,           American bit , I mean . It \'s just that Isobel did n\'t seem to know anything about you . Except that Katy had met you in London . And that your wife had died . " Conrad was holding his whisky tumbler . He turned it in his hand , watching the amber liquid swirl . After a bit he said , " Yes . That \'s right . " " I am so very sorry . " He looked up at her . He said , " Yes . " p271 " Can I ask ? What happened ? " " She had leukemia . She was ill for a long time . That \'s why I came over . After the funeral . " " What was she called ? " " Mary . " " How long were you married ? " " Seven years . " " Do you have children ? " " A daughter . Emily . She \'s six . Right now she \'s with my mother in Southampton . " " Getting away . . . has that made things better           get back . " " When are you going ? " " Next week sometime . " He tossed back the last of his drink , got to his feet . " I \'ll get us the other half . " She watched him as he stood at the bar , ordering and paying for their second round of drinks , and tried to work out why he was so unmistakably American , when he did n\'t actually chew gum nor sport a crew cut . Perhaps it was his shape , the broad shoulders , narrow hips , long legs . Or his clothes . Polished loafers , chinos , a Brooks Brothers shirt , a blue Shetland sweater discreetly tagged with the Ralph Lauren logo . She heard him ask the barman for some nuts . He did this quietly and politely , and the barman found a packet and emptied them into a little dish , and Virginia remembered that Conrad seldom raised his voice and was always mannerly to any person who happened to be doing a job for him . Gas-station attendants , barmen ,           odd job man who carried the trash and did all the dirty jobs down at the Leesport anchorage was much taken with Conrad , because Conrad had gone to the trouble to find out his Christian name , which was Clement , and always addressed him thus . A kindly man . She thought about his dead wife , and was certain that the marriage must have been a happy one , and was angry for him . Why did tragedy always aim its venom at the couples who least deserved it while others were spared to make each other miserable and everybody else as well ? Seven years . It was n\'t very long . But at least he had his little daughter . She thought of Henry , and was glad that he had a child . He was coming back to their table . She put a smile on her face . The whiskies looked very dark . She said , " I only meant to have one drink . I \'m driving . " " How far ? " 272 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p272 " About twenty           husband ? " " He \'s not at home . He \'s in New York . He works for Sanford Cubben . I do n\'t know if that got through to you on the grape-vine or not . " " I think I did know . How about your family ? " " If by family you mean kids , there \'s no family at home either . I have one child , a little boy , and I have just , this very afternoon , abandoned him to start his first term at boarding-school . That is how I have spent this gruesome day . The most ghastly day of my life . That \'s why I came in here . To go to the john and gather up my courage before travelling on . " Even to herself , she sounded truculent . " How old is your boy ? " " Eight . " " Oh , God ! " His voice was despairing , which Virginia found comforting . Here at last was a twin soul , someone who thought the way she thought . "           to go , and I fought every inch of the way . But his father was adamant . It \'s tradition . Good old British stiff-upper-lip tradition . He thinks it \'s the right thing to do , and he was all set to take Henry himself . But then he had to go to New York . So it had to be me . I do n\'t know which of us was most miserable , Henry or myself . I do n\'t know which of us I feel most sorry for . " " Was Henry okay ? Being left , I mean . Saying goodbye . " " Conrad , I do n\'t know . I honestly do n\'t know . It was the fastest turnround you could imagine . Split-second timing . Not a moment to stand , no time for a tear . I \'d hardly stopped the car before two burly chaps were there , opening the back door and manhandling all the luggage onto trolleys . And then the Matron . . . quite young and quite pretty . . . took Henry by           think he even looked back . I was standing there with my mouth open , all set to have a scene , and suddenly the Headmaster appeared from nowhere , shook me by the hand and said , " Goodbye , Mrs. Aird . " So I got back into the car and drove away . Do you know something ? I felt like a dead chicken on a conveyor belt . Do you think I should have asserted myself ? " " No , I do n\'t . I think you did the right thing . " " Nothing could have made it any better . " She sighed , drank whisky , set down the glass . " At least neither of us had the chance to disgrace ourselves . " " I guess that \'s what it \'s all about . " He smiled . " But you could still do with a bit of cheering . So why do n\'t we have dinner together ? " p273 " . . I never thought I \'d live in Scotland . To me it was a place one           bit of jollity and the odd Hunt Ball or two ; but never somewhere one would spend the rest of one \'s life . . . . " The King \'s Hotel was not famous for its food , but it was warm and friendly , and the darkness and the streaming rain out of doors offered no inducement to tramp the windy streets in search of someplace a little more sophisticated . They had already eaten their Scotch broth , and were now ploughing their way through steaks , onions , chips , and mixed veg . For pudding , there was a choice of trifle or various ices . The waitress had already told them that the trifle was " offly guid . " Conrad had ordered wine , which was perhaps a mistake , and Virginia was drinking it , which was a bigger one , because she did n\'t usually talk as much as this , and , for the life of her , she could n\'t think how to stop . Even if she \'d wanted to . Because Conrad was a sympathetic listener ,           On the contrary , he seemed to be fascinated . She had already explained about Edmund , and his first wife , and Vi and Alexa . She had told him about Henry , about Balnaid , about the almost indescribable remoteness , and yet closeness , of their existence in Strathcroy . " What goes on there ? " " Nothing , really . It \'s just a little place on the way to somewhere else . And yet everything . You know how small communities are . And we have a pub and a school , and shops , and two churches , and a dear queer who sells antiques . There always seems to be something going on . A jumble sale , or a garden opening , or a school play . " It sounded dreadfully dull . She said , " It sounds dreadfully dull . " " Not a bit . Who lives there ? " " The village people , and the Balmerinos , and the minister and his wife , and the rector and his wife , and the Airds . Archie           the village and thousands of acres of land . Croy is enormous , but he \'s not in the least grand , and neither is Isobel . Isobel works harder than any woman I know , which is saying something in Scotland because all the women beaver away endlessly . If they \'re not running huge houses , or bringing up children , or gardening , 274 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER. p274 then they \'re organizing enormous charity events or engaged in some home industry or other . Like running farm shops and selling all their own produce , or drying flowers , or keeping bees , or restoring antiques , or making the most beautiful curtains for people . " " Do n\'t they ever have fun ? " " Yes , they have fun , but it \'s not Long Island fun , and it \'s not even Devon fun . In August and September , everything comes to a rising boil and there \'s a party most nights , and hunt balls and shooting and things . You \'ve come at the right time , Conrad , though you           . But then the winter closes in and everybody hibernates . " " How do you see your girl-friends ? " " I do n\'t know . " She tried to work this one out . " It \'s not like anywhere else . We all live such miles apart , and there \'s no club life . I mean , there are n\'t country clubs like there are in the States . And pubs are n\'t the same as they are in the south . Women do n\'t really go into pubs . There are golf clubs , of course , but those are mostly male-orientated , and women are strictly personae non grata . You might go to Relkirk and meet a girlfriend there , but most of the socializing is done in people \'s private houses . Lunch parties for the girls , and dinner parties for the couples . We all get dressed up , and like I said , drive for forty miles or more . Which is one of the reasons that life more or less stops during the winter . That \'s when           can afford it , or Val d\'Isere for the skiing . " " And what do you do ? " " I do n\'t mind the winters . I hate the wet summers , but the winters are beautiful . And I go skiing up the glen . There \'s a ski-area only about ten miles on from Strathcroy , with a couple of tows and some good runs . The only thing is that if there \'s a lot of snow you ca n\'t get up the road . Which rather defeats the purpose . " " You used to ride . " " I used to hunt . For me , that was the whole purpose of riding . When I first came to Balnaid , Edmund said I could keep a couple of horses , but there did n\'t seem any point if there was to be no hunting . " " So how do you fill your days ? " " So far , " she told him , " I \'ve filled them with Henry . " She gazed at Conrad , in glum hopelessness           a single question the sum total of all her apprehension . Henry was gone , torn from her against her will . You smother him , Edmund had told her , and she had been furiously hurt and angry , but the smothering and the mothering had been her daily occupation and her greatest joy . p275 Bereft of Henry , there was only Edmund . But Edmund was in New York , and if he was n\'t in New York , then he was in Frankfurt or Tokyo or Hong Kong . Before , she had coped with these long separations , partly because there had always been Henry for comfort and companionship , but also because she had been totally confident , wherever he might be , in Edmund \'s strength and constancy and love . But now ... the doubts and dreadful possibilities of last night \'s waking nightmares crowded in on her again . Lottie Carstairs , that madwoman . . . but perhaps not so mad . . . telling Virginia things that she had never thought to hear . Edmund and Pandora Blair .           America ? He \'ll make a fool of you , same as he did his first wife , poor lady . Suddenly , it was all too much . To her horror , she felt her mouth tremble , her eyes prick with tears . Across the table , Conrad watched her , and for a mad instant she thought about confiding in him , spilling out all the anguish of her miserable uncertainties . But then the tears swam into her eyes and his face dissolved into a watery mist , and Virginia thought , oh , bugger , I \'m pissed . Just in time . The moment mercifully was over , and the dangerous temptation behind her . She must never speak about it to anybody , because if she did , then the words , said aloud , might make it all true . Might make it happen . She said , " I \'m sorry . So silly . " She sniffed lustily , searched for a handkerchief , could n\'t find one . Across the table , Conrad offered his own , white and           and blew her nose . She said , " I \'m tired and I \'m miserable . " She tried to make light of it , " I \'m also slightly pissed . " He said , " You ca n\'t drive yourself home . " " I have to . " " Stay here the night and go back in the morning . We \'ll get a room for you . " " I ca n\'t . " " Why not ? " Tears poured again . " I have to get back for the dogs . " He did not laugh at her . He said , " Stay here for a moment . Order coffee . I just have to make a telephone call . " He laid down his napkin , pushed back his chair , and went . Virginia mopped her face , blew her nose again , glanced around the dining-room , anxious that no other person had noticed her sudden attack of weepy emotion . But the other diners were all absorbed in their dinners , munch- p276 ing stolidly at fried fish           " trifle . The tears , mercifully , receded . The waitress approached to remove their plates . " Did you enjoy your steak ? " " Yes , it was delicious . " " Are you taking sweet ? " " No . I do n\'t think so , thank you . But if we could have some coffee ? " She had brought the coffee , and Virginia was already drinking the black and noxious stuff , which tasted as though it had been made out of a bottle , before Conrad returned to her . He drew back his chair and sat down . She looked at him inquiringly , and he said , " That \'s all settled . " " What have you settled ? " " I \'ve cancelled my room , and cancelled the hire car for tomorrow . I \'ll drive you back to Strathcroy . I \'ll drive you home . " " Will you go to Croy ? " " No . They \'re not expecting me until tomorrow morning . I can go to the pub you mentioned .           wo n\'t have a room . They \'re filled with grouse-shooting visitors who \'ve taken Archie \'s moor . " She sniffed away the last of her weeping , poured his coffee . " You can come to Balnaid . Stay the night there . The guest-room beds are all made up . " She looked up , and caught the expression on his face . She said , " There \'s no prob-lem , " but even as she said this , knew that there was . In the darkness , Conrad drove . It had stopped raining , as though the skies had run out of water , but the wind was from the south-west , and still damp , and the night stayed overcast . The road climbed and wound and dipped , and in the hollows lay pools of flood-water from the overflowing ditches . Virginia , bundled in her Barbour , thought of the last time that she had made this journey ; the evening Edmund had met her off the shuttle and they had had dinner together in Edinburgh . Then the sky had           Now the darkness was sombre and menacing , and the lights that shone from the windows of farmhouses scattered over the surrounding braes of Strathcroy gave little relief , seeming distant and unreachable as stars . Virginia yawned . " You \'re sleepy , " Conrad told her . p277 " Not really . Just too much wine . " She reached out and rolled down the window , and felt the cold , wet , mossy air pour over her face . The tyres of the Subaru hissed on the wet Tarmac ; out of the darkness came the long call of a curlew . She said , " That \'s the sound of coming home . " " You certainly live a long way from anywhere , " " We \'re just about there . " The street of the village stood empty . Even Mr. Ishak had closed up his shop , and the only lights were those that burnt from behind drawn curtains . On such a night people stayed at home , watched television , made tea . " We turn left , over this           the lane beneath the trees , came to the open gates , the drive that led to the house . All was , predictably , in darkness . " Do n\'t go around to the front , Conrad . Park just here , at the back , I do n\'t use the front door when I \'m on my own . I \'ve got the back-door key . He drew up , turned off the engine . While the headlights still burnt , she climbed down and went to unlock the back door , reach inside and switch on a light , The dogs had heard the car and were waiting , and showed gratifying excitement at her return , hurling themselves at her feet and uttering small welcoming noises in the back of their throats . " Oh , what good doggies . " She crouched to fondle them . " I \'m sorry I \'ve been such a long time . You must have thought I was never coming home . Go on , out you both go and spend pennies , and I \'ll give you lovely           happily out into the darkness , barked at the alien figure alighting from the Subaru , went to smell him , were patted and spoken to , and then , reassured , bounded off into the trees . Virginia went on , switching on more lights . The big kitchen slumbered , the Aga was warm , the refrigerator gently hummed to itself . Conrad joined her , carrying his grip . " Do you want me to put the car away ? " " No matter . We \'ll leave it in the yard for the night . Just take the keys out ... " " I have . . . . " He laid them on the table . In the uncompromising brightness , they regarded each other , and Virginia found herself overcome , quite suddenly , by a ridiculous shyness . To deal with this , she became businesslike and hostessy. 278 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p278 " Now . You \'d like a drink ? A nightcap . Edmund has some malt whisky he keeps for these occasions . " " I \'m okay . " "           I would . " " I \'ll get it . I wo n\'t be a moment . " When she came back bearing the bottle , he had taken off his coat and hat , and the dogs had returned from their nightly expedition and were already curled up on the beanbags by the Aga . Conrad , hunkered down , was making friends with them , talking softly , smoothing their highdomed well-bred heads with a gentle hand . As Virginia appeared , he stood up . " I \'ve closed the door , and locked it . " " How kind . Thank you . Actually , we often forget to lock doors . Thieves and robbers do n\'t seem to be a problem in Strathcroy . " She set the bottle down on the table , found a glass . " You \'d better pour it your-self . " " You \'re not joining me ? " She shook her head , rueful . " No , Conrad , I \'ve had enough for this evening . " He poured the malt and filled the tumbler from           . They took them politely , not snapping nor grabbing , and munched them appreciatively up . " They \'re beautiful spaniels . " " Edmund \'s gun dogs , and very well behaved . With Edmund in charge , they do n\'t dare be anything else . " The biscuits were finished . She said , " If you \'d like to bring your drink upstairs with you , I \'ll show you where you \'re sleeping . " She gathered up his hat and coat , and Conrad collected his grip , and she led the way out of the kitchen , turning lights off and on as she went . Down the passage , across the big hall , and up the stairs . " What a lovely house . " " It \'s big , but I like it that way . " He followed behind her . Below them , the old grandfather clock ticked the minutes away , but their feet made no sound on the thick carpets . The spare room faced over the front of the house . She opened the door           by the cold brilliance of the overhead chandelier . It was a large room , furnished with high brass bedsteads and a mahogany suite of Victorian furniture that Virginia had inherited from Vi . Taken unawares , it presented an impersonal face , without flowers or books . As well , the air was stuffy and unused . " I \'m afraid it does n\'t look very welcoming . " She dropped his hat and p279 coat on a chair and went to fling open the tall sash window . The night wind flowed in , stirring the curtains . Conrad joined her and they leaned out , gazing into the velvety darkness . Light from the window drew a chequered pattern on the gravel beyond the front door , but all else was obscured . He took a deep lungful of air . He said , " It all smells so clean and sweet . Like fresh spring water . " " You have to take my word for it , but we \'re looking at a wonderful view . You \'ll see it in the morning . Out           " From the trees by the church , an owl hooted . Virginia shivered and withdrew from the window . She said , " It \'s cold . Shall I close it again ? " " No . Leave it . It \'s too good to shut away . " She drew the heavy curtains , settling them so that there should be no chinks . " The bathroom \'s through that door . " He went to investigate . " There should be towels , and the water \'s always hot if you want to take a bath . " She turned on the small lights on the dressing table , and then the bedside light , and then went to switch off the cold brilliance of the chandelier . At once the high-ceilinged room was rendered cosier , even intimate . " I \'m afraid there \'s no shower . This is n\'t a very modern establish-ment . " He emerged from the bathroom as Virginia turned back a heavy bedcover , revealing puffy square pillows encased in embroidered linen , a flowered eiderdown . " There \'s           . " She folded the cover , laid it aside . " Now . " There was nothing more to occupy her hands , her attention . She faced Conrad . For a moment neither of them spoke . His eyes , behind the heavy horn-rims , were sombre . She saw his rugged features , the deep lines on either side of his mouth . He was still holding his drink in his hand , but now moved to set it down on the table beside the bed . She watched him do this , and thought of that hand gently fondling the head of one of Edmund \'s dogs . A kindly man . " Will you be all right , Conrad ? " An innocently intended question , but as soon as the words were spoken she heard them as loaded . He said , " I do n\'t know . " There \'s no problem , she had told him , but knew that the problem had lurked between them all evening and now could no longer be pushed out of sight . It was no           life was hell . She said , " I \'m grateful to you . I needed comfort " " I need you .... " 280 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p280 " I had fantasies about Leesport . Going back to Grandma and Gramps . I did n\'t tell you that . " " That summer , I fell in love with you .... " " I imagined getting there . In a limousine from Kennedy . And it was all the same . The trees and the lawns , and the smell of the Atlantic blowing in over the Bay . " " You went back to England ... " " I wanted someone to tell me I was great . That I was doing all right . I wanted not to be alone . " " I feel like shit .. . " " It \'s two worlds , is n\'t it , Conrad ? Bumping , and then moving apart . Light-years away from each other . " .. . because I want you . " " Why does everything have to happen when it \'s too late ? Why           It \'s not impossible . " " It is , because it \'s over . Being young is over . The moment you have a child of your own being young is over . " " I want you . " " I \'m not young any more . A different person . " " I have n\'t slept with a woman . . .. " " Do n\'t say it , Conrad . " " That \'s what loneliness is all about . " She said , " I know . " Outside in the garden , nothing moved . Nothing stirred the dripping leaves of the rhododendrons . Eventually , a figure slipped away down the narrow paths of the shrubbery , leaving a trail of footmarks on the sodden grass , the indentations of high-heeled shoes . p281 Wednesday the Fourteenth ISOBEL SAT AT HER KITCHEN TABLE , drank coffee and made lists . She was an inveterate list-maker , and these small inventories of things to be done , food to be bought , meals to be cooked , telephone calls to be made , as           dig up the gladioli , were constantly pinned to her kitchen notice-board , along with postcards from friends and children , and the address of a man prepared to clean the outside of the windows . At the moment she was working on three lists . Today , tomorrow , and then Friday . With one thing and another , life had suddenly become very complicated . She wrote : " Dinner Tonight . " There were some chicken joints in the deep-freeze . She could grill these or make some sort of a casserole . She wrote : " Get chicken legs out . Peel potatoes . String beans . " Tomorrow was more complicated , with her house party committed in three different directions . Isobel herself would be at Corriehill for most of the day , helping Verena and her band of ladies to arrange flowers and somehow decorate that enormous marquee . She wrote : " Secateurs . String . Wire . Wire-cutters . Beech-branches . Rowan-branches . Pick all the dahlias . " But , as well , there was Vi \'s birthday picnic by           shooting for Archie , because tomorrow they were driving grouse over Creagan Dubh , which meant that he would be joining the other guns . She wrote : " Baps and cold ham for Archie \'s piece . Gingerbread . Apples . Hot soup ? " As for Vi \'s picnic , Lucilla , Jeff , Pandora , and the Sad American would probably want to go to that , which meant a hefty contribution of goodies from Croy . 282 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p282 She wrote : " Sausages for Vi \'s barbecue . Make some beefburgers . Sliced-tomato salad . French bread . Two bottles wine . Six cans lager . " She poured more coffee , went on to Friday . " Eleven people for din-ner , " she wrote , and then underlined the words and sat debating over grouse or pheasant . Pheasant Theodora was spectacular , cooked with celery and bacon and served with a sauce of egg yolks and cream . As well as being spectacular , Pheasant Theodora could be concocted in advance , which precluded a lot of last-minute labour while the           Pheasant Theodora . " The door opened and Archie ap-peared . Isobel scarcely raised her head . " You like Pheasant Theodora , do n\'t you ? " " Not for breakfast . " " I did n\'t mean for breakfast , I meant for dinner the night of the party . " " Why ca n\'t we have roast grouse ? " " Because it \'s a fiddle to serve . Little last-minute bits and pieces , like scraps of toast to arrange and gravy to stir . " " Roast pheasant then ? " " Same objections . " " Is Pheasant Theodora the one that looks like sick ? " " It does , a bit , but I can cook it ahead , " " Why do n\'t you just cook a head ? " " Ha ha . " " What \'s for breakfast ? " " It \'s in the bottom oven . " Archie went over to the Aga and opened the oven door . " A red-letter day ! Bacon , sausages , and tomatoes . What \'s happened to the porridge           . Bacon , sausages , and tomatoes are what we always give visitors . " He brought his plate over to the table and settled himself beside her , pouring coffee , reaching for the toast and the butter . " I thought , " he said , " that Agnes Cooper was coming to help on Friday evening . " " So she is . " " Why ca n\'t she roast the pheasant ? " " Because she \'s not a cook . She \'s a washer-up . " " You could always ask her to cook . " " All right . I will . And we \'ll have mince and tattles for dinner because that \'s all the poor woman \'s capable of . " p283 She wrote . " Clean silver candlesticks . Buy eight pink candles . " " I just wish Pheasant Theodora did n\'t look like sick . " " If you say it looks like sick in front of all our guests , I shall cut your throat , there and then , with a fruit knife . " " What           Smoked trout ? " Archie put half a sausage into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully . " And pudding ? " " Orange sorbet . " " White or red wine ? " " A couple of bottles of both , I think . Or champagne . We \'ll be drinking champagne for the rest of the evening . Perhaps we \'d better stick to that . " " I have n\'t got any champagne . " " I shall order a crate today , in Relkirk . " " Are you going to Relkirk ? " " Oh , Archie ! " Isobel laid down her Biro and gazed at her husband in hopeless exasperation . " Do you never listen to anything I tell you ? And why do you think I \'m all dressed up in my posh clothes ? Yes , I am going to Relkirk today . With Pandora and Lucilla and Jeff . We \'re going shop-ping . " " What are you going to buy ? " " Lots of things for Friday night . " She did not say " A           up her mind about this extravagance . " And then we \'re going to lunch in the Wine Bar , and then we \'re coming home again . " " Will you get me some cartridges ? " " I \'ll get you anything you need if you \'ll write me a list . " " So I \'m not expected to come . " He sounded pleased . He hated shop-ping . " You ca n\'t come because you \'ve got to be here when the Sad American arrives . He \'s driving a hired car from Relkirk , and he \'s due sometime this morning . And you \'re not to go wandering off , otherwise he \'ll be faced by a deserted house and think he \'s not expected and go away again . " " Might be as well . What shall I give him for lunch ? " " There \'s soup and pate in the larder . " " Which room \'s he sleeping in ? " " Pandora \'s old room . " " What \'s his name ? " " I ca           to greet him ? Hail , Sad American . " Archie p284 seemed to find this funny . He made his voice enormously deep , " Big Chief Running Nose Speaks with Forked Tongue . " " You \'ve been watching too much television . " But luckily she found it funny too . " He \'ll think he \'s come to a madhouse . " " Would n\'t be all that far off the mark . What time are you setting off for Relkirk ? " " About half past ten . " " Lucilla and Jeff seem to be on the move , but you \'d better prize Pandora out of bed or you \'ll still be waiting for her at four o\'clock in the afternoon . " " I already did , " Isobel told him . " Half an hour ago . " " She \'s probably climbed back into bed and gone to sleep again . " But Pandora had not done this thing . The words were scarcely out of Archie \'s mouth when they heard the tap of her high heels coming down           she burst into the kitchen , her profusion of hair bright as a flame , and face filled with laughter . " Good morning , good morning , here I am , and I bet you thought I \'d gone back to bed . " She kissed the top of Archie \'s head and settled herself beside him . She was wearing dark-grey flannel trousers and a pale-grey sweater patterned with pink knitted sheep , and was carrying a magazine . This , it appeared , was the root cause of her amusement . " I \'d forgotten this marvellous mag . Papa used to take it every month . The Country Landowner \'s Journal . " " We still take it . I never got around to cancelling the subscription . " " I found this copy in my bedroom . It \'s simply fascinating , full of mind-boggling articles about something called Flea-Beetle Dust , and how we \'ve all got to be terribly kind to badgers . " She began to riffle through the pages . Isobel poured her a cup of coffee . " Oh ,           the ads at the back . Do listen to this one : For Sale , Titled Lady Wishes to Dispose of Underclothes . Peach-Pink Directoire Knickers and Silk Opera-Top Vests . Hardly Worn . Offers . \' " Archie finished munching his bit of toast . " Who do we write to ? " " Box number . Do you suppose that because she \'s titled , she \'s simply stopped wearing underclothes ? " " Perhaps somebody \'s died , " Isobel suggested . " An old aunt . And she \'s cashing in on the loot . " " Some loot . I think she \'s having a mid-life crisis and has changed her image . Gone on a diet and lost stones of weight and become all flighty . She \'s into satin camiknickers now with lace round the legs , and His Lordship does n\'t know what \'s hit him . And here \'s another marvellous p285 one . Do listen , Archie . Work Wanted . Personable Farmer \'s Son . ( Does that mean the farmer \'s personable or the son is ? )           . Fond of Shooting and Fishing . \' Just think ! " Pandora \'s eyes became enormous . " He \'s only thirty and he \'s able to drive a car . I \'m sure he \'d be frightfully useful to you , Archie . Some Experience in Draining . \' He \'d be able to take care of all the plumbing . Ballcocks and such . Why do n\'t you drop him a line and offer to take him on ? " " No . I do n\'t think so . " " Why ever not ? " Archie thought about it . " He \'s over-qualified ? " Simultaneously , their shared sense of the ridiculous bubbled to the surface and brother and sister dissolved into giggles . Isobel , observing them , shaking her head at their idiotic paroxysms of mirth , was nevertheless filled with grateful wonder . Since Pandora \'s arrival , Archie had been in better spirits than Isobel had seen for years , and now , sitting at her own breakfast table , she recognized once more that attractive and blissfully funny man           . Pandora was not the perfect guest . Domestically speaking , she was a dead loss , and Isobel spent much time clearing up after her -- making her bed , cleaning her bath , tidying away her clothes , and doing her laundry . But Isobel would forgive her anything , because she knew that it was his sister who had brought about the miraculous change in Archie , and for this she could be nothing but grateful , for somehow Pandora had rekindled Archie \'s youth and brought , like a gust of fresh wind , laughter back to Croy . The shopping party , one by one , mustered . Jeff , having eaten his way through Isobel \'s enormous breakfast , went to collect Pandora \'s Mercedes from the garage , and drive it around to the front of the house . Isobel , armed with shopping baskets and the inevitable lists , joined him . Pandora was the next to appear , wearing her mink coat and her dark glasses and reeking of Poison . It was another windy day with flashes of sunshine ,           for Lucilla . She came at last , shouted for by her father , and then shooed out through the door by him , just as he shooed his dogs . But she turned back to say goodbye , embracing and kissing him as though she were never going to see him again , before running down the steps with her dark hair flying . " Sorry , I did n\'t know you were waiting . " Lucilla was dressed in old and faded jeans with slits at the knees that had been ineptly patched with some red-spotted material .

DR . EVIL Gentlemen , I have a plan . It \'s called blackmail . The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world . Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money , or we make it look like Prince Charles , the heir to the throne , has had an affair outside of marriage and , therefore , they would have to divorce . There is an uncomfortable silence . # NUMBER TWO # Um , Dr. Evil , Prince Charles did have an affair . He admitted it , and they are now divorced , actually . DR . EVIL People have to tell me these things . I \'ve been frozen for thirty years           OK , no problem . Here \'s my second plan . Back in the Sixties I had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a " laser . " Using this laser , we punch a hole in the protective layer around the Earth , which we scientists call the " Ozone Layer . " Slowly but surely , ultraviolet rays would pour in , increasing the risk of skin cancer . That is , unless the world pays us a hefty ransom . There is another uncomfortable silence . # NUMBER TWO # Umm , that also has already happened . DR . EVIL Right . ( pause ) Oh , hell , let \'s just do what we always do . Let \'s hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage .

Here \'s the plan . We get the warhead , and we hold the           MILLION DOLLARS ! There is an uncomfortable pause . # NUMBER TWO # Do n\'t you think we should ask for more than a million dollars ? A million dollars is n\'t that much money these days . DR . EVIL All right then ... ( dramatic pause ) ... FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ! There is another uncomfortable pause . # NUMBER TWO # Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year . DR . EVIL ( pleasantly surprised ) Oh , really ?

Anything else ? # FRAU FARBISSINA # Remember when we froze your semen , you said that if it looked like you were n\'t coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever ?

Only two things , scare me , and one is nuclear war . # BASIL EXPOSITION # What \'s the other ? # AUSTIN # Excuse me ? # BASIL EXPOSITION # What \'s the other thing you \'re scared of ? # AUSTIN # Carnies. # BASIL EXPOSITION # What ? # AUSTIN # Circus folk . ( shudders ) Nomads , you know . They smell like cabbage . BASIL EXPOSITION ( suffering him ) Indeed ... If we could get back to the business at hand . It \'s one thing to have a warhead , it \'s quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it . # AUSTIN # Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle . ( hands him the photos ) I \'ve uncovered the details on Project Vulcan . It \'s a new subterranean warhead delivery system . # BASIL EXPOSITION # Good God , and underground missile . We \'ve long feared such a development . # VANESSA # When did you find that out , Austin           at Alotta Fagina \'s penthouse last night . # VANESSA # Oh . # BASIL EXPOSITON # Our next move is to infiltrate Virtucon . Any ideas ? # VANESSA # Yes , Virtucon runs a tour of their facilities every hour . I suggest we pose as tourists and do site-level reconnaissance . # BASIL EXPOSITION # Top drawer , Kensington . Oh , Austin , I want you to meet somebody . Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY . BASIL EXPOSITION Austin , this is my mother , Mrs. Exposition . She \'s in from Tunbridge Wells in Kent . Can you believe , she \'s ninety-two years old ? Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face . # BASIL EXPOSITION # My God , Austin , what have you done ? # AUSTIN # That \'s not your mother , that \'s a man ! Austin begins tugging on her hair . # MRS . EXPOSITION # Owww ... my hair ! # BASIL EXPOSITION # Get away from my mother ! # VANESSA # Austin , have you gone mad           to a cot . MRS . EXPOSITION ( through pain ) Who is that man ? Why did he hit me ? # BASIL EXPOSIION # Do n\'t worry , mother . Lie down . Austin , you have a lot of explaining to do . AUSTIN I \'m sorry , Basil , I thought she was a man . # BASIL EXPOSITION # Damn it , man ! You \'re talking about my mother ! # AUSTIN # You must admit , she is rather mannish . No offense , but if that \'s a woman , it looks like she \'s been beaten with an ugly stick . # VANESSA # Really , Austin ! # AUSTIN # Look at her hands , baby ! Those are carpenter \'s hands . # BASIL EXPOSITION # All right , Austin , I think you should go . # AUSTIN # I think if everyone were honest , they \'d confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag . BASIL EXPOSITION I \'m leaving ! ( pause ) Oh , and Austin ? # AUSTIN # Yes           # AUSTIN # Thanks . Basil escorts his mother out . # VANESSA # Austin , may I have a word with you ? # AUSTIN # Of course , luv . # VANESSA # Listen , I know I \'m just being neurotic , but I ca n\'t shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary , Ms. Fagina . I mean , I do n\'t want to sound paranoid , but I \'ve had some bad relationships in the past , and I have some jealousy issues . You went to her penthouse . It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities , but I ca n\'t help but feel this weird , irrational , unfocused ... well , jealousy . I \'m sorry . # AUSTIN # Do n\'t be sorry . You \'re right to be suspicious . I shagged her . I shagged her rotten . VANESSA ( stunned ) I ca n\'t believe you made love to her just like that . Did you use protection ? # AUSTIN # Of course , I had my nine-millimeter automatic . # VANESSA           AUSTIN # Only sailors use condoms , man . # VANESSA # Not in the Nineties . # AUSTIN # Well they should , filthy beggars , they go from port to port . Alotta meant nothing to me . VANESSA ( pause ) Well , it means something to me . If you want us to have a relationship , you \'ve got to be a one-woman man . # AUSTIN # It was just a shag , Vanessa . You \'re everything to me. # VANESSA # You just do n\'t get it , do you , Austin ? Good night . Welcome to the Nineties , you \'re going to be very lonely . INT .

Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below . We see the CDs he \'s just purchased , including SERGEANT PEPPER \'S and BURT BACHARACH \'S GREATEST HITS . Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened Campbell \'s Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on . It explodes in a shower of sparks and soup . He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle . The NOISE is awful . Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III . His fighter gets his head ripped off , and blood spews out . Austin is genuinely frightened by this . # INT . BATHROOM # Austin attempts to use the Water Pik , but the head is too loose and water shoots all around the bathroom . EXT .

EVIL An evil petting zoo ? SCOTT EVIL ( shouting ) You always do that !

EVIL No , the boy \'s right . I really am evil . # THERAPIST # Do n\'t be so hard on yourself . You \'re here , that \'s what \'s important . A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step . # SCOTT EVIL # I just think , like , he hates me . I really think he wants to kill me . THERAPIST OK , Scott , no one really wants to " kill " anyone here . They say it , but they do n\'t mean it . The group LAUGHS . DR . EVIL Actually , the boy \'s quite astute . I am trying to kill him . My Evil Associates have cautioned against it , so here he is , unfortunately , alive . # THERAPIST # We \'ve heard from Scott , now let \'s hear from you . DR . EVIL The details of my life are quite inconsequential . #           , tell us about your childhood . # GROUP # Yes , of course . Go ahead , etc . DR . EVIL Very well , where should I begin ? My father was a relentlessly self- improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery . My mother was a fifteen-year-old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet . My father would womanize , he would drink , he would make outrageous claims , like he invented the question mark . Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy . A sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament . My childhood was typical . Summers in Rangoon , luge lessons . In the spring we \'d make meat helmets . If I was insolent , I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds . Pretty standard , really . At the age of twelve I received my first scribe . At the age of fifteen , a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles . There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum . At the           school . From there ... ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP . They are stunned .

We \'ll use the floss to get to the ledge . # AUSTIN # Smashing idea ! Give it to me . Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo . He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches like a grappling hook . Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack . Meanwhile , the slow-dipping mechanism is edging           drawing out the floss . He keeps pulling out floss . More floss still . The mechanism continues to sink . Finally , the floss line goes TAUT . Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism . Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon -- Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand . Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss . Austin places the open tube on his palm , aimed at the guard . Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard loudly . He turns around . # AUSTIN # Judo chop !

CLIPS FROM MOVIE - AUSTIN IN TIGHT CLOSE-UP AUSTIN Behave ! THE \n ( and Us , Your Plain , Boring Fifth-Graders ) Will the new girl come between Amelia and Katy ? Or will they learn the secret of friendship ? // Have you seen her yet ? " That \'s the first thing I ask Katy as we \'re trudging toward school on Friday . There was a blizzard yesterday , so we had a snow day . Katy trekked to my house and we attempted to build an igloo . Then we made mugs of hot chocolate with a million minimarshmallows . " Seen who ? " Katy asks . " I did n\'t tell you ? " I stop in my tracks . " I seriously did n\'t tell you ? " " Amelia , " Katy groans , rolling her eyes . " Stop being a drama queen . " I jump up and down on the icy sidewalk . " I \'m SO not being a drama queen ! " Katy giggles . Of course I \'m being a drama queen . Katy and I have been best friends since kindergarten . We \'re midway through fifth grade , so she knows me well by this           , loud most of the time . Katy is Korean-American and a violinist . She \'s a straight-A student , but teachers are always telling her to speak up . " The new girl , " I say . " My mom rented her family their house . Her name is Stella and she starts today . " " So there \'s a new kid , " Katy says . " What \'s so great about that ? " " First of all , she \'s from New York City- " " Eight million people live in New York City , " Katy says , shifting her violin strap on her shoulder . " Thanks , Miss Census , but will you let me finish ? I never get a word in around you ! " Katy makes a face like I \'ve insulted her , but I can tell she \'s trying to keep from laughing . " What I was trying to say is that Stella is ... " I clear my throat . " She \'s famous , Katy . " " Famous ? " Katy asks           big singer . Her parents told my mom that she \'s sung on children \'s albums . She \'s even been in commercials . " " What \'s she doing here ? " Katy gestures at our tiny town in the Adirondacks . " My mom said her parents are painters , " I say . " They came to the mountains for inspiration . " " What commercials has she been in ? " " That , " I say , linking arms with Katy as we push through the doors of school , " is what we \'ll learn when we become friends with her . " I am the luckiest girl in the Adirondacks ! Stella winds up in Mr. Maloney \'s class-the same class as Katy and me . We \'re sitting at our desks , waiting for the day to begin , when this girl walks in . She \'s got light-brown hair that has a cotton-candy streak of pink down the front . She \'s wearing a purple skirt with black and white striped tights and bracelets up both arms . As she walks           . " Is that her ? " " Yep , " I say , beaming . She fits my mom \'s description perfectly . " Are you sure she \'s our age ? " Katy whispers as Mr. Maloney directs Stella to an empty desk . " That \'s what my mom said . Besides , if she were older she \'d be at Butler Middle . " I watch as Stella slides on lip gloss . I have images of Katy and me hanging out with her . She \'ll show us how to put streaks in our hair . Maybe she \'ll give us singing lessons . By the time we get to middle school , we \'ll have some serious status . We definitely need that to survive sixth grade . I open my notebook and begin sketching a flower . As I \'m doodling , I try to figure out how to become friends with Stella . Maybe I \'ll mention that my mom rented her their house . Or maybe " Katy ? " Mr. Maloney says . " Can you come here please ?           I watch as Mr. Maloney says something to Katy . She nods , and then he says , " Stella ? " As Stella approaches his desk , she smiles and says hi to Katy . They both laugh and leave the room . My pulse is racing . I ca n\'t believe Mr. Maloney has chosen Katy , of all people , to show Stella around the school . Maybe he picked her because she \'s musical like Stella . Mr. Maloney is always telling Katy and me that we need to branch out . So now he \'s matching Katy up with Stella , and they \'re going to hit it off . And guess who \'ll be left alone to dodge spitballs at Butler Middle next year ? I am the most miserable girl in the Adirondacks . As Mr. Maloney drones on about book reports , I watch the clock . Katy and Stella have been gone for 45 minutes . I bet they \'re skipping down the halls , laughing their heads off . At 10 o\'clock , when we go to art class ,           tear my tissue paper into angry little shreds . A few minutes later , the door opens . Katy approaches my table , but I stare down at my collage . I can see out of the corner of my eye that Stella is with her . I \'m so not looking up . " Hey , you , " Katy says . " Oh , " I say like I had n\'t realized she was there . " I have to go to orchestra . Can Stella sit with you ? " I shrug . " Sure . " Katy turns to Stella . " This is my best friend , Amelia . The one I was telling you about . " As Stella slides into my table , Katy walks out . I know I should feel better , but I \'m still on edge . I want Stella to be my friend , to be this new person who makes my life amazing . I wish I could snap my fingers , and we could bypass the getting-to-know-you stuff and be comfortable around each other . Like           , I have no idea what to say . I bet it was n\'t this way for Katy . She \'s quieter than me , but she always has interesting things to talk about . After a few painfully silent minutes , Stella says , " Want to hear something depressing ? My birthday \'s tomorrow and my parents just moved me away from all my friends . " All of a sudden , it clicks . If I want Stella to be my friend , I have to start somewhere . " Maybe you could come to my house , " I say . " Really ? " Stella asks . And then , typical me , I zoom from zero to 60 in 2 seconds . " I \'ll bake you cupcakes ! " When Stella does n\'t respond , I add , " I \'ll invite Katy , too . " When Stella still does n\'t respond , I say , " Come over at 6 o\'clock . " Then I grab a marker and scribble down my address and phone number . On Saturday evening ,           \'ll give us a chance to frost the cupcakes . As Katy kicks the slush off her boots , I say , " What did you get for her ? " " A picture frame , " she says . " I painted it last night . " " Why \'d you have to do that ? " I ask . " I just bought her a bracelet . Now she \'s going to think I \'m boring . " " Hi to you too , " Katy says , making a face at me . But this time she actually looks mad . I lead Katy into the kitchen . I \'ve taped up streamers and balloons . I even put on some of my mom \'s lip gloss . As Katy and I are frosting the cupcakes , the phone rings . " Amelia ! " my mom calls from upstairs . " It \'s for you . " I lick some chocolate frosting off my fingers and grab the phone . " Hello ? " " Hey , it \'s Stella . " I glance at the           minutes . " What \'s up ? " I ask . " My big sister just drove in from Boston to surprise me , " Stella says . " My parents did n\'t even know she was coming . She has to leave first thing in the morning . " I can sense right away where this is heading . I feel Katy watching me , so I turn toward the wall . " I \'m so sorry , Amelia , " Stella says . " I never get to see my sister anymore . Can we maybe hang out another weekend ? " " OK , " I say quietly . I feel a lump forming in my throat . " Thanks for understanding , " Stella says . " See you in school on Monday . " " See you in school , " I whisper . After we hang up , I stand there , my hand still on the phone . " What was that about ? " Katy asks . All of a sudden , I start sniffling . " Did Stella just bail on           " That is not nice ! " Katy yells . I turn around and stare at Katy . She \'s never talked so loudly in her entire life . Katy goes on about how you ca n\'t cancel at the last minute unless you \'re deathly sick or snowed in , and even in the case of a blizzard , that \'s what boots are for . At some point during her rant , I tap her arm . " What ? " she asks in this booming voice . I wipe my eyes and explain about Stella \'s sister and how she never gets to see her and how , even though I feel bad , it \'s nice she got a visitor , especially since she just moved away from all her friends . " I did n\'t know she had a sister , " Katy says . " Me neither . " I pause . " Come to think of it , I do n\'t know anything about her . " " Other than she \'s famous and you want to be her new best friend ,           " I shriek . Then I exhale deeply , massage my temples , and say , " I \'m sorry for what I said about the picture frame . That was n\'t nice , either . " Katy nods . " I know you think we \'re plain and boring . But we have fun , right ? " " Yeah . But are n\'t you worried about middle school ? " " Whatever happens , we have our friendship . " Katy pauses for a moment . " We have to promise we wo n\'t ditch each other if something better comes along . Maybe we \'ll become friends with Stella . But no matter what , you and I come first . " " Definitely , " I say . Then I stick my fingers in the edges of my mouth and go cross-eyed . Katy stares at me . " May I ask what you \'re doing ? " " I \'m just wondering ... " I waggle my tongue from side to side , " whether the party can still go on ? " " Definitely           cupcake , tap them together , and take a bite . Write to Win !

The story is about two best friends named Amelia and Katy . The two girls are excited because           is especially eager to befriend Stella because Stella is from New York and has been on TV . But things do n\'t work out like Amelia hopes they will . First , Katy , instead of her , is picked to show Stella around the school . Then , in art class , Amelia feels shy when she has to talk to Stella alone . But , she soon comes up with a plan to get Stella to like her : She invites Stella over to her house for a birthday party . Unfortunately , when the day finally arrives , Stella cancels . At first , Amelia and Katy feel this way about their change in plans : angry and disappointed . But as time passes , they realize that Stella was n\'t doing it to be mean . Plus , they learn a valuable lesson about friendship : old friends are just as important as new ones . \n 1961 // August . // When Tip is standing in the doorway as he is right now , it can only mean one thing . I brace myself . He shouts , eyes pleading : // " Milk ! " // After two and a half months , I \'m starting to get used to it . Very jarring at first , but now I \'m practically a pro . I counter , with excellent timing : // " Paint ! " // Aha . Got him . He was n\'t ready for that . // " Paint ? " // I raise my head from the potato chip coupon I \'ve been laying out with blue pencil for the past ten minutes and arch my right eyebrow , which is all he needs . Sketchy ignores us , as always . // " Faaassssssssinating . " It \'s like a gas leak from Tip \'s mouth and he darts back down to his office . // And I am reminded , grateful : This can be a pretty fun place to work . // * * * // June . // Who am I ? I am Happy           -- it \'s my name . A nickname , to be more precise , which I acquired relatively late in life , as those things go . From a teacher of mine in college , freshman year . And because of that it will always be who -- not what -- I am. // I wear it proudly , my sleeve \'s own Purple Heart . // Me : twenty-one years old , Caucasian male of mixed Anglo-Italian origin , olive-skinned , round tortoise-shell horn-rimmed glasses , hair sort of like Brandon De Wilde \'s in Shane , otherwise not interesting to look at . Or at least that \'s what the evidence would suggest . // Which is fine by me , because I \'m the one doing the looking . I \'m a graphic designer -- I pretty much see the world as one great big problem to solve ; one typeface , one drawing , one image at a time . Life is a life-long assignment that must be constantly analyzed , clarified , figured out , and responded to appropriately . // I am inquisitive ,           while I \'m wary of any sort of unfamiliarity I am also quickly and easily bored by routine . I grew up in the eastern mid-Atlantic region of the United States , raised Protestant -- the United Church of Christ -- but have become very much of the " religion is the opiate of the people " school ( the sole piece of common sense I gleaned from a course on Marxist theory , senior year ) , which of course I have elected to keep from my roundly nice , doting parents , lest they call the police . But I am close to my family , the way you are close to other people in a small crowded elevator that has temporarily stalled but will be moving any minute now . And as far as I was concerned , that minute was almost here . // Let \'s see , what else . I am convinced that ALL sports are a sanctioned form of mass-demonic worship , that cathedrals and museums have traded roles in the greater culture , and that Eve Arden is woefully underappreciated by society           , cracking your neck , secret decoder rings , glass tea kettles , whoopie pies , and television test patterns . And -- ahem -- graphic designers . That should do for now . // Wait , I \'m forgetting something . Oh . // I do not write poetry . // But most of all : I am eager to start my career as a newly certified Bachelor of the Arts in Graphic Design , with a very specific goal -- acquiring a job at the advertising agency of Spear , Rakoff & Ware ; two states away , up in New Haven , Connecticut . // Why ? Simple . // It \'s where Winter Sorbeck started . Long ago . // Now , yes -- Winter , the teacher in question who christened me , my GD instructor during my first year at State -- is a whole other story . And certainly one with no small amount of pain . But however bullying , severe , terror-inducing , and unnerving he was ( and boy , was he ) , he was equal parts mesmerizing ,           any teacher I \'d had , before or since . By the end of that spring semester he abruptly quit the faculty and vanished . I would have gladly dropped out to follow him anywhere , but no amount of amateur detective work revealed where that might be . So I bided my time , worked for the next three years to get my degree , and upon graduation decided : If I could n\'t be where Winter was now , I \'d go where he \'d been . In the course of solving one of his earlier assignments I discovered that he started his career at Spear , Rakoff & Ware , and if that was good enough for him , it would be good enough for me. // Mandatory , actually . // And proving difficult . No surprise there -- if Winter was anything , he was difficult , as would be anyplace associated with him . But no doubt worth the trouble . I approached the firm early , in March , three months before graduation . My initial inquiry went unanswered , as did my           annual First Fiction award ) , and the letter of recommendation I \'d extorted from the dean \'s secretary . By May I was desperate , so I telephoned . The voice that greeted me hummed with the same welcome slow tone I knew from three years earlier , when I \'d called for help on that gum wrapper label design problem for Winter . It was Milburne " Sketchy " Spear -- the head of the art department . He did n\'t remember me and I did n\'t remind him -- I wanted a clean start . The years had not changed his enthusiasm : // " Oh , you do n\'t want to work here . " // " Um , yes sir , I do . " // " Really ? " // " Yes sir . " // Silence . // " Hello ? " // " Sorry , I \'m inking . Mind \'s a porch screen when I \'m inking . I \'m trying to do a crowd scene with a Number 5 Pedigree pen tip . Should be using a Radio 914 .           , never could . God , I stink . Would n\'t you rather work someplace else ? Where people did n\'t stink ? " // What ? " No sir , I \'d like to work for your firm . You know , to sort of get my feet wet . " Dreadful . Why did I say that ? // " Heh . " He sounded like a lawnmower trying to start . " Heh . That \'s what I thought . I mean , that \'s what I thought when I got here . You know when that was ? " // " No . I -- " // " You know dirt ? " // " Dirt ? " // " Dirt . " // " Um , yes . Dirt . " // " Well , I started here the year before they discovered it . " // " I see . " // " Heh . " // " At least ... it must have been spotless when you arrived . " // " Heh-heh . Can you airbrush ? " // " Yes ,           " // " Did you receive my rsu -- " // " Do you know what I \'m doing right now ? " // " Uh , drawing a crowd scene with a ... Number 5 Pedigree pen tip ? " // " No , that \'s done . Now I \'m trying to decide what kind of face the potato chip should have . That \'s always the question . Everything \'s a question . " // " Pardon ? " // " For this newspaper ad . A whole half-pager , due by five . Everyone signed off on it yesterday -- the crowd , see , they \'ve all filed out into the street to worship a giant potato chip . " // " I see . " // " Because it \'s a Krinkle Kutt . One of our biggest accounts . " // " Right . " // " Six stories tall . " His tone was casual , as if he was telling me about his brother-in-law . " So , exactly what sort of expression should it have on its face ? Because           to be a Krinkly Kollosus , and looked up to by all these tiny people , who adore it so . " // " Well ... it \'s obvious to me. " // " That right ? " // " It should look chipper . " // " Heh . " // " So to speak . " Boy , was I making this up . Pure hokum . " You know , not so smug . He does n\'t want to frighten everyone . I mean , I \'d be wary of a protean jagged slab of tuber towering over my fellow citizens , our fate in his many , many eyes . Especially if he \'s been fried in lard . Which he has , I hope ? " // " Heh . You still want to work here ? " // " Definitely . " // \n I went to find Hayden Carruth when I was living in Vermont in the mid-seventies and he was running his small farmstead , patching together a living with literary hackwork , haying , tractor repair , barn-building , and any other money-eking enterprise , on a hill outside Johnson about forty miles from me . When I phoned in advance , his was the quietest telephone voice I \'d ever heard ; each sentence seemed to fade toward silence as it closed . His best poems are like that , softspoken , plain , even when the emotional signature is hacked or burnt into hardwood , and they possess absolute candor about everything . He \'s the least self-censoring person I know , his honesty embedded in Camus \' writings , which were foundational for him . So there we were one summer afternoon sitting on the small porch of the modest house he kept with his then-wife Rose Marie . He \'s chewing on his pipe stem , looking off into the distance . He gazed - his conversation seemed aimed at some elsewhere . He lived so deeply inside himself that he makes the oily , **25;334;TOOLONG           . When I pulled out my cigarettes , he cadged one . // - A little whiskey would go well with this . // So there we were , smoking Luckies , sipping Jim Beam or some other corny liquor , when a typical country Vermont oil-burning junker too large to fit in most people \'s living rooms rattles past . // - Glad I do n\'t have to earn money fixing those things anymore . // He was n\'t talking about a summer job . He \'d done everything except teach , which would come later . He called himself a hack because he \'d done , for money , just about every sort of writing and editing , working in the cowshed we could see from the porch . I asked about the stream that ran near his house . // - You \'re a Vermonter , you should know it \'s not a stream , it \'s a brook . // - I \'m not a Vermonter . I \'m from South Philadelphia , you know that . We \'d call it a creek , a crik.           . // We talked for hours . He loved Dryden \'s dramatic lyrics and put me on to the poetry of Paul Goodman , whom I knew from the frantic sixties only as a social critic . We smoked up a storm . Smoking has been one of his greatest pleasures . Back then he went through twenty pipes a day easy . In his autobiography , Reluctantly , he describes an uncle smoking : " He would talk and exhale smoke at the same time , so that the smoke came out every whichway , as if it were the ectoplasmic embodiment of his language . " PANIC // One pick-up job was his stint as editor of Poetry in 1950 . He was proud he never kept a poet waiting more than five weeks for an answer . But he riled the board - he was trying to revamp and amp up things with more challenging poems and feistier prose - so within a year he was out . He loved Chicago for its jazz and blues and can still run down the sidemen on many sessions ,           cities . He did n\'t like having too many people around and suffered disabling panic attacks and other agonizing psychological ailments that afflicted him but lived in the shadow of the major one - suicidal depression . CALIFORNIA // Early nineties . He visits me in California . We drive over an old stage road to the ocean and along the way , while he blows cigarette smoke out through the window like a teenager , he asks the names of trees , grasses , flowers , stuff he \'s never seen . He points to a shrub with smoky blue flowers . // - What \'s that thing ? // - Ceanothus . They call it California lilac . // - But it \'s not lilac . Does n\'t look anything like lilac . // That night I cook minestrone and joke about how Italians cook vegetables to kingdom come . // - So did my grandmother . Cooked the hell out of \' em . I do the same . This is good . ITALIAN RESTAURANT // Mid-nineties and he \'s back in California to read at Stanford           I find him at the bar of a trendy Italian restaurant in Palo Alto . He \'s retired from Syracuse and lives in Munnsville , an upstate New York hamlet briefly famous for a fratricide documented in the movie My Brother \'s Keeper . We have n\'t seen each other in a few years and make small talk until the bartender drifts over and asks our pleasure . // - Get Chianti ( the only red Hayden seems to drink ) . // - I \'ll have a Prosecco. // - ( Bartender ) Sorry , sir , we do n\'t have that . // - How can you call yourself an Italian restaurant and not serve Prosecco ? // - Right ! That \'s telling him ! You have to make yourself heard . Bring this man a glass of Chianti ! // At dinner with his vivacious wife Joe-Anne , Hayden looking much older since his last visit , he \'s telling a story and trying to set it in context . // - That was about six months after I killed myself , right , Joe-Anne ?           his suicide attempts , the time he came closest , in 1988 , when he took every pill in his possession - and there were many indeed to take . His first knowledge of the suicidal impulse , involving more smoke , is recorded in Reluctantly . As a twelve-year-old sitting on a riverbank with a flirty girl who challenges him to toss away the pack he \'s smoking , he throws it into the river . The image of the pack falling and floating away lived powerfully in him ever after : " Why did n\'t I pitch myself after it and dash out my brains on the rocks below ? " It would have been that easy , even then . ON A WALK // As part of his visit , Stanford has arranged a TV interview . The morning of the taping , he tells Joe-Anne he \'s stepping out for a little air . The event coordinator arrives to pick him up but Hayden \'s nowhere in sight . The coordinator waits , Joe-Anne waits , the studio waits . After an hour , everyone (           spirit tells him to do ) is frantic . Should they put out a missing persons report ? Will they need a helicopter ? Will the TV affiliate hate Stanford ? Fast-forward the crisis . A few hours later , Hayden re-appears at the Faculty Club where he \'s been housed . The coordinator is a wreck ; Joe-Anne frets not at all . // - I just had a nice long walk . It \'s quite beautiful here . What \'s wrong ? W.S. Di Piero // Because He Was Flesh // Frank MacShane , the biographer of Raymond Chandler , was the first one to introduce me to Edward Dahlberg . He gave me his book Because I Was Flesh and then , when I was finished , he gave me his address so I could write a fan letter . I had never done such a thing before . It was 1965 . I was twenty-four . Dahlberg answered me immediately and for a couple of years I would receive letters from him that were both solicitous and patriarchal . In a certain sense these letters changed           who was said to be the originator of the proposition that one perception must immediately lead to the next - a proposition that drove American poetics from after ww11 on - was not a poet unless you call a highly-charged , iambic , metaphorical prose " poetry . " Some people call Moby-Dick a poem . I call Because I Was Flesh a poem as well as Dahlberg \'s less known book , Bottom Dogs . Perhaps it is simply a term of respect for those who push language to its limit . // Dahlberg left a burn mark on whomever he met ; he branded his students and friends and then abandoned them as his mother had for a time abandoned him . He even broke off with the other priapic genius Charles Olson over the value of Moby-Dick . Dahlberg wrote that " Moby-Dick is gigantology , a tract about a gibbous whale and fifteen or more lawless seamen , who are alone , by choice , though they are together . " He was against Melville , who may have been too strong an influence . //           lady barber . And in order to get a flavor of the man one must read lines like these , describing the orphanage where he spent childhood time : They were a separate race of stunted children who were clad in famine . Swollen heads lay on top of ashy uniformed orphans . Some had oval or oblong skulls ; others gigantic watery occiputs that resembled the Cynocephali described by Hesiod and Pliny . The palsied and the lame were cured in the pool of Bethesda , but who had enough human spittle to heal the orphans \' sore eyes and granulated lids . // Dahlberg talked and wrote like this . Unlike Charles Olson , whom he \'d met at Harvard and whose work would always return to postwar Eurpoean philosophy and American politics , the autodidactic Dahlberg had identified with the proletarian underground since the twenties - and with ancient texts ; he went into seven years of withdrawal from writing to study these . His first book , Bottom Dogs , had an introduction by D.H . Lawrence . After his withdrawal , he renounced his former           all men who aspired to write , and his early works . // In a letter written to me in December , 1966 , he wrote : Now , you ca n\'t admire Tolstoi along with Joyce , Jane Austen and Henry James . That \'s the usual academic pother of the day . Should you have understood Tolstoi you wo n\'t be able to read the famous rubbish of James , Joyce and Austen . You must learn how to expurge what is foolish , bad garbage ; otherwise you \'ll never find those values you long for and should possess . Now , I know it is well-nigh impossible to give people good advice , particularly when you \'ve got no doctrine or dogma to go along with it . But just take from an experienced worm of prose style that this kind of chaotic and amorphous thinking will be a fell obstacle to your own ripening . // We met in cafes in New York and once at Elaine \'s where he was disgusted by what he saw . I was proud to be with him ,           interest , my desire to please him . He sent me a list of writers I was instructed to read by June , 1967 . This is that list , verbatim : Osiris by Wallis BudgeEgypt by MasperoThe Book of Job by Morris JastrowThe Song of SongsThe Gentle CynicThe Voyage of the Beagle by DarwinL\'Amour by StendhalPhysiology of Marriage by BalzacEnquiries into Plants by TheophrastesThe History of GreeceGreek Poets by John Addington SymondsLives of the Greek Philosophers by Diogenes LaertiusLast Essays by Eric GillProlegomena to the Study of Greek Religion by Jane HarrisonAmiel \'s JournalThe Goncourt JournalsImaginary Conversations by Landor // And later he handed me a further list : Burton \'s Anatomy of MelancholySir Thomas BrowneTwelve Caesars by SuetoniusAnimals and Birds by BuffonLes Characteres by LydellLove of the Nymphs by PorphyryGil Bias by Le Sage // Dahlberg had no interest in mystical thinking . Myth was good , but best was the point of view of the naturalist and the anthropologist . I read some of the above , but concealed from him my other reading ( then mostly European fiction in translation - Montale , Camus , Duras           could n\'t handle . I was a sucker for bullies . I submitted , I even married them , but I did n\'t grovel or let it go on too long . // My friendship with Dahlberg ended bitterly . He chased me around his apartment on Rivington Street with his pants down , having locked the door from the inside , and I had to leap out a window to get away from him . My last letter from him was a racist diatribe against my marriage and the wasting of my " sweet , honeyed flesh . " // What I received from him , before this event , was invaluable : the sense of the writer \'s life as a religious vocation . You had to protect yourself from Philistines , and read what he would call " ethical " writing . That is , writing that is so conscious of potential falsehoods , contradictions , and exaggerations in its grammar , it avoids becoming just one more symptom of the sick State . Dahlberg told me to take a vow of poverty if I was serious           heart , not the head , and he insisted on seeking a physicality in language that was palpable . This was his politics , he who had been a card-carrying Communist , and to this day I believe he was right . I was like one of his orphans , starved for truths that he gave me : Though all day long nothing was in the ailing minds of the orphan-asylum Ishmaels but the cry for food , what these mutes ask for was never given . O Pharisee , when will you learn that we never came to your table for the gudgeons and the barley loaves ? Fanny Howe // // By W.S. Di Piero and Fanny Howe // \n Her heart was pounding as she sat in the car . Before her was the house , a giant white colonial with black shutters , a quaint portico , and the three-car garage set off to the side where she now found herself , wondering . What have I done ? // She took a breath to stave off the panic that was beginning to seep inside her . She needed to be careful . She reached for the garage remote , then thought better of it . The chain runner would cut through the still night air like a buzz saw . She killed the headlights , then the ignition . Her hand slipped inside the door latch , pulling it slowly until it clicked . She pushed open the door and swung her feet outside the car . She removed her shoes , her favorite strapped heels , and hung them on her fingers . She draped her purse around her shoulder , then , as softly as she \'d opened it , closed the door with her hip . The soft silk of her skirt was deliciously sensuous as it brushed against her bare leg ,           // The sound of the neighbors \' sprinkler coming to life startled her as she began to make her way around the back of the house . Her feet stepped like a cat \'s paws on the asphalt , and for a moment she was frozen in place , listening to the initial burst of water followed by a rhythmic pulsating-the pinging of water drops as they hit a small section of a flagstone terrace on their way around . Placing the sounds , she pictured the neighbors \' yard , the two acres of flat green grass , the free-form pool , the stone wall that divided their property from her own . Then her yard and back door , up the stairs to the children in their rooms , the husband in her bed . The reasons she was creeping about under the midnight sky . // Taking another breath , she carried on , around the outside of the garage to the patio-through the maze of wrought-iron furniture , kick balls , plastic toys , and gas grill , and finally to the sliding glass door that           she pushed it slowly , then looked inside , making out the shapes of things in the dark room-the oval table that was still piled with remnants from the dinner , a bottle of ketchup , The New York Times , a plastic sippy cup . It was the heart of their lives , this kitchen . She could see the babies , four of them in eight years , sitting in the high chair that now resided in the basement with the rest of the childhood monuments . She could see them running around the island as she chased behind them , their shrieks of laughter filling the room as they avoided capture . She could feel in her bones the toll from the daily struggles-getting them to eat , umpiring fights , and saving them from spilling over as they climbed upon their chairs like unruly savages at dinnertime . This was the place where they played , talked , cried , and fought with each other . And though she felt drawn to it like a time traveler returning home from a long journey , she remained           . // It was not a terrible life . Janie Kirk was a suburban housewife , the steadfast bottom of an inverse pyramid upon which the demands of her family balanced . It was a life founded at its core in her love for the children who lay sleeping inside . From there it grew heavy with the weight of their needs , and those of her husband , which she had carried on her shoulders for so many years . School , soccer , ballet , swimming . Doctors , dentists , speech therapists . Food on the table every day . Laundry , yard work , pets . Birthday parties . Dieting . Sex . It was an odd existence when she stopped to consider it , but so completely common that she rarely did , and it occurred to her that it would be close to perfect if she had n\'t contracted the unfortunate disease of discontentment . // She was standing now between two worlds , her eyes taking in her life , her mind reliving the feel of his hands on her body not an           . In that desire , she had seen the teenager in the back of his father \'s Cadillac , the young man whose heart she \'d so foolishly broken in high school , then the college lover who \'d broken hers . He had been , in that moment , every first kiss , every curious glance from across a room . All the things she \'d left behind so many years ago . // She recalled the firm hand gripping the back of her head and pulling her to him , the other hand reaching for her back . The hold was strong , powerful , and she \'d given into it without the slightest hesitation , without a second thought . Then came the kiss , and with it a warm burning under her skin . She \'d opened her eyes and pressed her mouth harder against his , no longer someone \'s wife , someone \'s mother . Just a woman . And he was nothing to her but a man she desired . He had tried to speak , You \'re so beautiful . . .           waited for the sound of his voice to disappear from her mind , along with everything else she knew about him . The shape of his face , the color of his eyes , his house and family . All of it had vanished . There had been no place for talk , no need for reassurances or stating one \'s intentions . The confines of their social structure that kept the wheels turning in this privileged existence had been suspended , and for the first time in her life she had not cared what her lover thought-if he was comparing her to past lovers , assessing her performance , her body-whether he would call her , see her again , marry her and buy a house , have children and live happily ever after until they were both dead in the ground . // She closed her eyes now , wanting to remember for one moment more the feel of his weight over her , her legs wrapped around him , pulling him closer-her mouth on his , nearly consuming him in a frantic embrace . And yet her           opened her eyes and took a breath . How could she have imagined that this would be possible , that she could walk through that door and up the stairs , kiss her children , then crawl beside her sleeping husband ? She had wanted this night for a long time , and the thought of this night had somehow managed to coexist with her inside those walls . Now that she had given life to her thoughts , now that she had given in to what was , at best , a purely selfish act of weakness and depravity , she felt alive . Her body , her senses , her mind . Everything was awake again . It was a feeling of intoxication , and though she was nearly sick from it , she knew she would have to have more . There would be war between what awaited her and this narcotic flowing through her blood , and there would be no chance of reconciling the opposing needs that would now demand attention within this house . // What have I done ? she thought again ,           uncertain course . With a quiet resolve , she stepped inside . // \n The day started off different from any other . First of all , we slept in a hotel the night before , which was rather strange seeing as though we had an apartment just blocks away . Then , that morning my mom woke me up and dressed me quickly while my dad loaded up his friend \'s car with our suitcases . My mom sat me on her lap in the backseat of my dad \'s friend \'s car . My dad sat in the passenger seat . It was so early in the morning that I could see the sun rising over the palm trees as we drove away from the hotel . I remember thinking about how beautiful the sight was and then falling asleep in my mother \'s arms . // When I was awakened by my mom we were at a small airport . My dad \'s friend had stopped the car and he and my dad got out and started taking our suitcases from the trunk . There was a small plane on the ground just a few feet from where we were parked . It was like a big open parking lot           were in and the small plane my dad and his friend were transferring our bags onto . My mom carried me out of the car and over to the plane . There were two men already on board whom I never saw before , but my mom and dad apparently knew them well as they greeted each other with hugs . One man helped my mother and me onto the plane while the other went to the cockpit . My father hugged his friend as if he was saying farewell and then joined my mom and me . A big smile on his face , my dad caressed my mother \'s knee , then kissed her on the lips . I turned my head to look out the window as the plane started to slowly pull away . My dad reached down and tickled my stomach , bringing my attention back to him . I laughed so hard and tried to resist , prying his big hands off my tiny body every chance I could . // " Mommy , help me ! " I squealed , squirming around on           along . Soon tears started rolling down my cheeks I was laughing so hard . Then my dad stopped , calling himself giving me a break . I wiped my eyes and was trying to catch my breath when the plane took off . The sudden increase in speed and the force of the plane lifting off the ground took me by surprise . I started choking on my own air . My mom immediately started to pat my back and my dad lifted my arms up over my head . // " Enough already . You \'re going to kill the poor child , " the man who had helped us on the plane said . // I stopped choking and laid my head back against my mom \'s breasts . I remember looking at the man and wondering if he was serious about what he said about my dad killing me . I waited for him to smile or laugh and when he did n\'t I concluded that he was a bad man . I rolled my eyes at him and turned on my side so I would           me on her lap to suit my new position and before long I was asleep again . // Boom ! // " Aaarrrr ! Aaarrrr ! Aaaarrrrr ! " // I woke up to the echoing sound of a gunshot and the screeching sound of my mother \'s screams . I burst into tears at the sight of my father slumped over in his seat beside my mother and me . Blood was splattered all over my mom \'s clothes and I could feel it on my head and face . My mother tried to jump from her seat but was held down by the seat belt . Startled and panicked , she was unable to unbuckle it no matter how many times she tried . // " Shut up ! " the bad man shouted to my mother , still holding the gun that he had used on my father . // " What you do that for ? What wrong with you ? ! " my mother shouted in broken English . // " I said shut up ! " the man shouted back , knocking my mother           // I wanted to scream when I saw my mother \'s head fall back against the seat of the plane , but somehow I did n\'t . I guess I was afraid that I would suffer the same punishment if I did scream . So instead , I squeezed my eyes shut and cried as quietly as I could . I only opened them slightly when I heard my mom going off again . // " Nooo ! Noooo ! Please no ! Please ! Oh God noooo ! Cliff ! Cliff , help us ! ! " my mom yelled , a tooth falling from her bloody mouth . // I followed my mom \'s eyes and saw the man dragging my father toward an opened door on the plane . I turned my body around and jumped in my mother \'s arms with my knees in her lap . I squeezed her so tight and buried my tear-covered face in her chest . Muffling my voice , I screamed , " Daddy ! " And that was it . I felt my mother \'s body jerk forward as           dropped to the floor and practically crawled over to the door . With me still in her arms she tried to throw herself from the plane . It took the man hitting her again with the butt of the gun to keep her back , but that time he hit her in the head . She fell backward and I was on top of her . I was crying uncontrollably while maintaining my grip on her . // I was scared for my life . I did n\'t know if the man was going to throw me off the plane next or if he was going to hit me with the gun . All I knew was that he had killed my father and there was no telling what else he was capable of . I clung to my mother for dear life . I could feel her heart beating so I knew she was still alive , but I hoped and prayed that she stayed unconscious so that she would n\'t get hit again . As I lay there on top of my mother in the aisle of the           The wheels hit the ground with such power and the plane started to decelerate . Once we came to a complete stop , I heard the man \'s footsteps walking in my mom \'s and my direction . My heart was pounding and the tears were gushing out . I had no idea what the man was going to do to us . I closed my eyes and held my mom tight , then I felt him pulling me. // At that point I did n\'t know what else to do but scream . He was taking me from my mother and most likely was going to kill her , too . I yelled out to my mother , screaming for her to wake up , begging her to help me . She did n\'t budge . I did n\'t give up though , because I knew she was n\'t dead . I knew I felt her breathing under me . I just needed her to wake up . I knew if she had woken up she would have fought for me . She would n\'t have let the man           screamed and how much I pleaded , my mother remained unconscious . I was taken off the plane and put inside an empty shack where I was gagged and bound to a chair . My tiny teeth sank into a dusty bandanna . My eyes were covered with a blindfold . My little wrists and ankles were held together by duct tape . I was left alone , scared and confused . I just knew my life was about to be over and that \'s a hell of a feeling for anyone to have , let alone a five-year-old . // I did n\'t know how many days went by , but I knew I was hungry and dehydrated . I felt like I had lost every bit of my energy , like I was dying . I felt myself drifting off to sleep when the door opened . I had to squint because even through the blindfold the beaming sunrays bothered my eyes , now so used to pitch darkness . I heard two sets of footsteps coming toward me and I tried to muster the strength to scream           . But then I heard the voice of the man who had killed my dad and I froze with fear . // " Her father was killed and her mother was deported back to the Dominican Republic . I figured with what you \'re doing , you could take her . She \'s young and fresh , perfect for your business . I \'ll give \' er to you for little money , too . " // " Let \'s talk outside , " an unfamiliar male voice suggested . // I was frightened beyond words . I did n\'t know what the men were plotting . Their footsteps headed away from me and it got dark again . I was trying to think of something to do or say to get their attention , particularly the attention of the unfamiliar male . At that point I would have gone with anyone if it meant getting out of that chair and getting to some food and water . // Within minutes I heard only one set of footsteps coming my way . My heart started to pound . I did           to hate or his companion . I felt someone \'s hand peeling away the duct tape from my wrists and ankles . Then the blindfold came off and the bandanna was removed from my mouth . I started coughing and I was so weak I could n\'t cover my mouth . My body was limp . There was a man , dark skinned like my dad , staring at me . He was more muscular and looked a lot older than my father , though . His hair was cut close to his head , almost bald . He had a light mustache and goatee and he appeared to be well groomed . He did n\'t look mean like the bad man who had brought me there and for some reason I did n\'t feel afraid anymore . I actually felt a sense of security , like I had been rescued . He picked me up out of the chair and my back ached terribly . He carried me out of the shack and put me in a dark-colored SUV . It was air-conditioned inside and the soft leather seats           been sitting in all those days . I lay across the backseat and struggled to keep my eyes open . // " You hungry ? " the man asked , climbing into the driver \'s seat . // I tried to answer him but I could n\'t . I was too weak . The man picked up a Kit Kat , opened the wrapper , and handed the four chocolate wafers back to me. // I began eating the Kit Kat like it was a McDonald \'s cheeseburger . I lifted my head a little when the man pulled up in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant . I was licking my dirty fingers when he turned off the car and hopped out . // " I \'ll be right back , " he said . // I just nodded real slowly . When he got back inside the car he sat in the backseat beside me . He sat me up and placed a bunch of food in front of me . I reached out for the drink he had in his hand and he put the straw           were shaking so badly that I could n\'t hold the cup on my own . He had to help me . He fed me , too . After eating the chicken sandwich , French fries , and juice , I burst into tears . // The man rubbed my head , starting from my hairline . He worked his way down to the middle of my back where my ponytail ceased . // " I \'m sorry about what you had to go through , " he said . " But that \'s life . Children pay for the sins of their fathers . " // Not paying him much attention , I lay back down on the seat and continued crying softly . The man discarded all the trash from the food and then got back in the driver \'s seat . Flashbacks of what happened to my parents kept piercing my brain . The vivid images , the pleasant breeze that poured in all four of the car windows , and my ongoing tears put me in a deep sleep . When I woke up I was being           taken upstairs and placed on a bed . I was sweaty and sticky and my clothes were filthy with bloodstains all over them . I was surprised that the man had laid me on clean sheets . // " I \'m Chatman , by the way , " the man finally introduced himself to me . " Sophia will come clean you up , okay ? " // I nodded my head yes . // He turned to walk out of the room and then paused . He looked back at me and assured me , " If you need anything , she \'s the one to ask , all right ? " // I nodded yes again.Chatman then continued out of the room . He closed the door behind him . // Immediately , I felt myself becoming tired again . My eyes were closing and I was just about asleep when a young yellow-toned girl with tiny eyes and black curly hair came into the room . Unable to control my nerves , I jumped . // She pouted and approached me slowly . // " What \'s           . // " I want my mommy ! " I cried out . // The woman , whom I assumed to be Sophia , knelt down by the bedside . Her eyes watered as she reached out and wrapped her skinny arms around me. // " I know , sweetheart , " she sang , rubbing my back . " And I \'m sure your mommy wants to be with you , too . " // Sophia began to take me out of my clothes . She wrapped a towel around me. // " My name is Sophia . What \'s yours ? " she asked , walking me down the hall to the bathroom . // " Sienna , " I whispered . // " Sienna ? Is that what you said ? Do n\'t be shy . " // I nodded as she placed me in a tub of warm water . // " That \'s a pretty name , " she commented , dipping a washcloth in the water and wringing it out . She started washing my face , scrubbing my forehead first . Then she           scrubbing my body with it . After she was done , she rinsed me off with the water . Next , she gently laid me backward just enough for my hair to fall in the water . I was resistant , scared to go back , but she sang in her little voice that she was not going to hurt me . She took out my ponytail and wet my hair thoroughly . Then she shampooed it . A few washes later she put conditioner in and combed it through each strand . // " You \'re hair is so pretty and long . Is your mother \'s hair like this ? " she asked . " I bet she was one pretty lady . " // I nodded , almost breaking into tears again envisioning my mother \'s beautiful lemon-colored skin and long dark hair , her bronze eyes looking down at me and her smile that lit up my life . Sophia wiped away the one tear that managed to escape and asked , " How old are you ? " // I held up five little fingers           age . Well he \'s a couple years older actually , but ... " Sophia paused . " I miss him so much . " She sniffled . " I know how you must feel . " // After that it was complete silence . Sophia rinsed the conditioner from my hair , took me out of the tub , dried me , and dressed me in a big T-shirt and some mix-match socks . She took me back to the bedroom I would later call my own . She put me in the bed and walked over to close and lock the only window in the room . By then it had grown dark outside . I remember purposely watching her every move . The fact of the matter was I did n\'t trust her . I did n\'t trust anyone at that point . I could n\'t . For all I knew everybody in the house was out to hurt me . I mean , I had witnessed a man who had smiled in my father \'s face right before he murdered him . So as far as           you whom you had to watch close . And that \'s what I did . I paid close attention to everyone -- all the women who came and went , Chatman , and all his workers . And in the process I learned a lot . // I learned all about Chatman \'s business in the sex trade , the boatloads -- or shipments as he called them -- of women from overseas he would pay for , the doctors that would come to the house to examine them in the basement , and the circle of guys Chatman had working for him that would do anything he asked at the drop of a hat . I learned that Chatman had power and along with his power came money . And in just two short years I watched Chatman go from a small-time businessman who had a three-bedroom home in a rough part of Florida to a self-made billionaire who laid down cash for a **28;336;TOOLONG mansion in an affluent neighborhood in Miami Beach called Star Island . // It was a Tuesday when we moved into the ten-bedroom ,           of the last episode of Encyclopedia Brown and I had to miss it because we had n\'t gotten the cable connected yet . Sophia was most excited about the move . From the day that Chatman came home with pictures of the new house until months later when we were actually able to move into it , she spent the hours she was supposed to use home-schooling me expressing how happy she would be once Chatman moved us out of the small house and into the huge dream home . She had big plans for that house and had no idea that she \'d never step foot in it . Apparently she and Chatman had totally different agendas . I will never forget it . // A U-haul truck pulled up to our house . We all thought it was there to move all the things we had packed up . But as it turned out , it was there to take away the women Chatman made his fortune off of over the past decade , among them Sophia . I was in Sophia \'s room playing in her makeup           of the other Thai girls came in crying . Sophia , nurturing as she was , rushed to console her . // " Noi , what \'s wrong ? " Sophia asked her , rubbing her back . // " He \'s selling us ! " Noi wept . // " He \'s what ? " Sophia asked . // " He \'s selling us . Our time is up . He \'s getting new women , younger ones . We \'re not going with him . He \'s sending us away . " // Sophia grew concerned . " Where did you hear this ? " // " From his mouth ! That U-haul out there is n\'t for this furniture ! It \'s for us ! " Noi screamed . // Anger took hold of Sophia \'s face as she let the information penetrate . Then she got up from the bed and walked out the room . I jumped from the vanity and followed behind her , only I stopped in the hall when she barged into Chatman \'s office . // " Chatman , tell me           demanded right away . // " Now is not the time , Sophia , " I heard Chatman say in an oddly calm tone . // I could n\'t see Chatman , but I could imagine the look on his face . Over the years I had gotten to know Chatman and based on what I knew I would n\'t have dared do what Sophia had . It was a wonder she was still standing . The Chatman I knew would have slapped her into the kitchen the minute he realized it was she who had swung his office door open . // " Now is the time , Chatman ! I \'ve been with you since I was fifteen years old ! That \'s ten years , Chatman ! You did n\'t do this alone ! You \'ve achieved all that you have on our hard work ! We planted the seeds and you mean to tell me you \'re not even going to let us taste the fruit ! You \'re gon na replace us with some girls who did n\'t contribute one second to the last ten           " Sophia ranted. // " I said , now is not the time , Sophia ! " Chatman yelled . // At that point , I backed into Sophia \'s room , only peeking out her doorway . Noi stood in front of me and some of the other girls were scattered in the hall whispering among themselves . // " Chatman ! " Sophia shouted one last time before being slapped off her feet . // Next thing I knew , her frail body flew out of Chatman \'s office and onto the hallway floor . A.J. , Chatman \'s right hand , immediately started running up the steps from downstairs . // " What \'s going on , boss ? " A.J. asked in a ready-for-action tone . // " What did you just call me ? " Chatman asked A.J. // A.J. looked baffled . " Boss , " he repeated himself . // " Say it louder , " Chatman ordered , looking down at Sophia cringing in fear on the floor . // " Boss ! " A.J. shouted , following Chatman \'s instructions .           the boss around this motherfucka ! " Chatman said , kicking Sophia in her stomach and ribs . // Sobbing , Sophia cowered beneath Chatman , who was beating her to no end . A.J. tried to get Chatman to let up off of Sophia several times before he actually did , and by then she was covered in blood and could hardly walk . " Take the bitch to the truck ! " Chatman instructed A.J. " Y\'all other bitches follow ! " he yelled to the other girls who were all in the hallway crying in dismay . // " What about my boy , Chatman ? Huh ? Is that deal off , too ? " Sophia whimpered as she was being carried down the steps by A.J. // " Shut the fuck up , " A.J. told her as more of a warning than a command . // But she kept going . " You promised me ! You promised him ! Please ! Please send for my boy like you promised ! " // Chatman leaned over the banister to respond to Sophia . "           this ! You got knocked up the day you got here ! The only reason why I did n\'t beat that baby out of you was because you kept the pregnancy from me ! " // " I was fifteen years old ! I hardly spoke English then ! If you wan na blame somebody , blame your fucking partner ! He sought me out ! " Sophia sobbed . // " That \'s why he \'s not here anymore ! " Chatman retorted . " And now you wo n\'t be here anymore ! I can start fresh and run my business the way it \'s meant to be run without distractions like you ! Every time I turn my back you \'re in one of my workers \' faces ! A.J. , get her the fuck out of here ! " // A.J. headed for the front door , carrying Sophia \'s limp body in his arms . // " Oh , and as for your son , I \'ll send for him , all right ! He \'ll follow in his mother \'s and his father \'s           \' im up \' til he ca n\'t be used no more , then throw \' im over like I did his scheming , conniving , worthless parents ! " // " You \'re a cruel bastard , Chatman ! And I hope you burn in the hottest pits of hell ! " were the last words I heard Sophia speak . // I was seven at the time and a child no more . I had seen so much in my short life that my mind and my heart had long outgrown my body . I was all alone once again , taken away from a person whom I had considered to be another mother . It was weird that I did n\'t cry , though . I just remember thinking that I had to be tough . I remember telling myself that I was a woman now and that I was left to teach myself , to understand , and to deal with the world I had been given . I made myself a promise that from that day on I would not get attached to anyone ever           That promise was easy to keep even when we moved into the mansion and the new boatload of more than twenty teenage girls moved in with us . Chatman had given me my own room and that \'s where I stayed most of the time , playing with my dolls or using Sophia \'s home-schooling material to teach myself stuff like reading and mathematics . // I did n\'t communicate with the new girls . Most of them did n\'t speak English well anyway . So for a long time I stayed to myself , until another newcomer drew me out of my shell . // One afternoon , Chatman had left the house with A.J. and when they returned they had a boy with them . He was older than me but much younger than any of Chatman \'s workers . Chatman called me into his office and introduced me to the boy . // " Sienna , this is Ryan , " Chatman said . // Then he told me that Ryan would be staying with us for a while and that I was to share my room           share my room , but for some reason I felt an instant connection to Ryan , so I did n\'t complain . I just told Chatman okay and walked Ryan out of Chatman \'s office and down the long marble hallway to my room . // " How old are you ? " I asked Ryan as soon as we got in my room . I sat down on my bed and he stood in the middle of the floor as if he was lost . // " Nine , " he said , looking around . " How old are you ? " // " Seven and a half . Where are you from ? " I continued my personal questionnaire . // " This is a big house , " Ryan said , looking up at the ceiling . " Is your dad rich ? " he asked . // " My dad is dead , " I answered him . // He took his eyes off the ceiling and looked at me . His big brown eyes softened and buck teeth bit his bottom lip . //           asked . // I nodded my head . " So where are you from , like I said ? " // " Thailand , " he responded . " Where you from ? " // " Here . But my mom is in the Dominican Republic , " I said , remembering what the man who killed my father had told Chatman . " And one day I \'m going to find her and live with her . " // " My mom is here in America , " he said . " She used to live here . Do you know her ? " He pulled out a small cut-off picture of a beautiful lady and put it in my face . // " That \'s Sophia , " I said , enthused . " I know her . She took care of me. " // " She did ? " he asked , surprised . // " Uh-huh . " // " Do you know where she is now ? " he asked . // " No , " I said , wanting to change the topic .           , " he said , looking down at the picture . // Feeling sadness coming on , I quickly turned chipper and suggested , " You can help me find my mom and I can help you find yours . " I figured I \'d offer hope . // " Okay , " he said , nodding his head as if he were in negotiations . // I just smiled at the little nave boy and then introduced him to my toys . I took a pretty sudden liking to Ryan . I guessed it was because we had similar situations and goals and we often shared them with each other . He became the only person in the house I truly trusted and confided in and over time we found ourselves dangerously attracted to each other . But who knew the chemistry that brewed between us would turn out to be fire and ice . // Continues ... \n Gold was up 2 percent the morning Benjamin Raab \'s life began to fall apart . // He was leaning back at his desk , looking down on Forty-seventh Street , in the lavish comfort of his office high above the Avenue of the Americas , the phone crooked in his neck . // " I \'m waiting , Raj . . . . " // Raab had a spot gold contract he was holding for two thousand pounds . Over a million dollars . The Indians were his biggest customers , one of the largest exporters of jewelry in the world . Two percent . Raab checked the Quotron screen . That was thirty thousand dollars . Before lunch . // " Raj , c\'m on , " Raab prodded . " My daughter \'s getting married this afternoon . I \'d like to make it if I can . . . . " // " Katie \'s getting married ? " The Indian seemed to be hurt . " Ben , you never said- " // " It \'s just an expression , Raj . If Kate was getting married , you \'d be there . But           talking gold here-not pastrami . It does n\'t go bad . " // This was what Raab did . He moved gold . He \'d owned his own trading company near New York \'s diamond district for twenty years . Years ago he had started out buying inventory from the mom-and-pop jewelers who were going out of business . Now he supplied gold to half the dealers on the Street . As well as to some of the largest exporters of jewelry across the globe . // Everyone in the trade knew him . He could hardly grab a turkey club at the Gotham Deli down the street without one of the pushy , heavyset Hasids squeezing next to him in the booth with the news of some dazzling new stone they were peddling . ( Though they always chided that as a Sephardi he was n\'t even one of their own . ) Or one of the young Puerto Rican runners who delivered the contracts , thanking him for the flowers he \'d sent to their wedding . Or the Chinese , looking to hedge some dollars against a           uncut blocks of industrial-quality stones . // I \'ve been lucky , Raab always said . He had a wife who adored him , three beautiful children who made him proud . His house in Larchmont ( a whole lot more than just a house ) that overlooked the Long Island Sound , and the Ferrari 585 , which Raab once raced at Lime Rock and had its own special place in the five-car garage . Not to mention the box at Yankee Stadium and the Knicks tickets , on the floor of the Garden , just behind the bench . // Betsy , his assistant for over twenty years , stepped in carrying a chef \'s salad on a plate along with a cloth napkin , Raab \'s best defense against his proclivity for leaving grease stains on his Herms ties . She rolled her eyes . " Raji , still . . . ? " // Benjamin shrugged , drawing her eye to his notepad where he had already written down the outcome : $648.50 . He knew that his buyer was going to take it . Raj           for years . But did he always have to play out the drama so long ? // " Okay , my friend . " The Indian buyer sighed at last in surrender . " We consider it a deal . " // " Whew , Raj . " Raab exhaled in mock relief . " The Financial Times is outside waiting on the exclusive . " // The Indian laughed , too , and they closed out the deal : $648.50 , just as he \'d written down . // Betsy smiled- " He says that every time , does n\'t he ? " -trading the handwritten contract for two glossy travel brochures that she placed next to his plate . // Raab tucked the napkin into the collar of his Thomas Pink striped shirt . " Fifteen years . " // All one had to do was step into Raab \'s crowded office and it was impossible not to notice the walls and credenzas crammed with pictures of Sharon , his wife , and his children-Kate , the oldest , who had graduated from Brown ; Emily , who           Justin , two years younger-and all the fabulous family trips they \'d taken over the years . // The villa in Tuscany . Kenya on safari . Skiing at Courchevel in the French Alps . Ben in his driver \'s suit with Richard Petty at the Porsche rally school . // And that \'s what he was doing over lunch , mapping out their next big trip-the best one yet . Machu Picchu . The Andes . Then on a fantastic walking tour of Patagonia . Their twenty-fifth anniversary was coming up . Patagonia had always been one of Sharon \'s dreams . // " My next life " -Betsy grinned as she shut the office door- " I \'m making sure I come back as one of your kids . " // " Next life , " Raab called after her , " I am , too . " // Suddenly a loud crash came from the outer office . At first Raab thought it was an explosion or a break-in . He thought about triggering the alarm . Sharp , unfamiliar voices were barking commands . // Betsy           face . A step behind , two men in suits and navy windbreakers pushed through the door . // " Benjamin Raab ? " // " Yes . . . " He stood up and faced the tall , balding man who had addressed him , who seemed to be in charge . " You ca n\'t just barge in here like this . What the hell \'s going on . . . ? " // " What \'s going on , Mr. Raab " -the man tossed a folded document onto the desk- " is that we have a warrant from a federal judge for your arrest . " // " Arrest . . . ? " Suddenly people in FBI jackets were everywhere . His staff was being rounded up and told to vacate . " What the hell for ? " // " For money laundering , aiding and abetting a criminal enterprise , conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government , " the agent read off . " How \'s that , Mr. Raab ? The contents of this office are being impounded as material evidence in           Before he could utter another word , the second agent , a young Hispanic , spun Raab around , forcing his arms roughly behind him , and slapped a set of handcuffs on his wrists , his whole office looking on . // " This is crazy ! " Raab twisted , trying to look the agent in the face . // " Sure it is , " the Hispanic agent chortled . He lifted the travel brochures out of Raab \'s hands . " Too bad . " He winked , tossing them back onto the desk . " Seemed like one helluva trip . " // Chapter Two // " Check these babies out , " Kate Raab muttered , peering into the high-powered Siemens microscope . // Tina O\'Hearn , her lab partner , leaned over the scope . " Whoa ! " // In the gleaming luminescence of the high-resolution lens , two brightly magnified cells sharpened into view . One was the lymphocyte , the defective white blood cell with a ring of hairy particles protruding from its membrane . The other cell was thinner           the center . // " That \'s the Alpha-boy , " Kate said , slowly adjusting the magnification . " We call them Tristan and Isolde . Packer \'s name for them . " She picked up a tiny metal probe off the counter . " Now check this out . . . . " // As Kate prodded , Tristan nudged its way toward the denser lymphocyte . The defective cell resisted , but the squiggle cell kept coming back , as if searching out a weakness in the lymphocyte \'s membrane . As if attacking . // " Seems more like Nick and Jessica , " Tina giggled , bent over the lens . // " Watch . " // As if on cue , the squiggle cell seemed to probe the hairy borders of the white blood cell , until in front of their eyes the attacking membrane seemed to penetrate the border of its prey and they merged into a single , larger cell with a white dot in the center . // Tina looked up . " Ouch ! " // " Love hurts ,           Kate explained , looking up from the scope . " The white one \'s a lymphoblast-what Packer calls the-killer leukocyte . \' It \'s the pathogenic agent of leukemia . Next week , we see what happens in a plasma solution similar to the bloodstream . I get to record the results . " // " You do this all day ? " Tina scrunched up her face . // Kate chuckled . Welcome to life in the petri dish . " All year . " // For the past eight months , Kate had been working as a lab researcher for Dr. Grant Packer , up at Albert Einstein Medical College in the Bronx , whose work in cytogenetic leukemia was starting to make noise in medical circles . She \'d won a fellowship out of Brown , where she and Tina had been lab partners her senior year . // Kate was always smart-just not " geeky " smart , she always maintained . She was twenty-three . She liked to have fun-hit the new restaurants , go to clubs . Since she \'d been twelve , she           . She had a boyfriend , Greg , who was a second-year resident at NYU Medical School . She just spent the majority of her day leaning over a microscope , recording data or transcribing it onto digital files , but she and Greg always joked-when they actually saw each other-that one lab rat in their relationship was enough . Still , Kate loved the work . Packer was starting to turn some heads , and Kate had to admit it was the coolest option she \'d had for a while . // Besides , her real claim to distinction , she figured , was no doubt being the only person she knew who could recite Cleary \'s Ten Stages of Cellular Development and had a tattoo of a double helix on her butt . // " Leukoscopophy , " Kate explained . " Pretty cool the first time you see it . Try watching it a thousand times . Now check out what happens . " // They leaned back over the double scope . There was only one cell left-larger , squiggle-shaped Tristan . The defective lymphoblast had           If that happens in a living model , there \'s got to be a Nobel Prize in this . " // " In ten years , maybe . Personally , I was just hoping for a graduate dissertation . " Kate grinned . // At that moment her cell phone started to vibrate . She thought it might be Greg , who loved to e-mail her funny photos from rounds , but when she checked out the screen , she shook her head and flipped the phone back into her lab coat . // " If it \'s not one thing it \'s a mother . . . " she sighed . // Kate led Tina into the library , with about a thousand recorded iterations of the stem-cell line on digital film . " My life \'s work ! " She introduced her to Max , Packer \'s baby , the cytogenetic scope worth over $2 million , which separated chromosomes in the cells and made the whole thing possible . " You \'ll feel like you \'re dating it before the month is through . " // Tina           " I \'ve done worse . " // That was when Kate \'s cell phone sounded again . She flipped it out . Her mom again . This time there was a text message coming in. // Kate , something \'s happened . Call home quick ! // Kate stared . She \'d never gotten a message like that before . She did n\'t like the sound of those words . Her mind flashed through the possibilities-and all of them were bad . // " Tina , sorry , but I got ta call home . " // " No sweat . I \'ll just start the small talk rolling with Max. " // With a jitter of nerves , Kate punched in the speed dial of her parents \' home in Larchmont . Her mom picked up on the first ring . Kate could hear the alarm in her voice . // " Kate , it \'s your father . . . . " // Something bad had happened . A tremor of dread flashed through her . Her dad had never been sick . He was in perfect           a good day . // " What \'s happened , Mom ? Is he okay ? " // " I do n\'t know . . . . His secretary just called in . Your father \'s been arrested , Kate . He \'s been arrested by the FBI ! " // Chapter Three // They took the cuffs off Raab inside FBI headquarters at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan , leading him into a stark , narrow room with a wooden table and metal chairs and a couple of dog-eared Wanted posters tacked to a bulletin board on the wall . // He sat there staring up at a small mirror that he knew was the two-way kind , like on some police drama on TV . He knew what he had to tell them . He \'d rehearsed it over and over . That this was all some kind of crazy mistake . He was just a businessman . He \'d never done anything wrong in his entire life . // After about twenty minutes , the door opened . Raab stood up . The same two agents who           young man in a gray suit and short , close-cropped hair , who placed a briefcase on the table . // " I \'m Special Agent in Charge Booth , " announced the tall , balding agent . " You \'ve already met Special Agent Ruiz . This is Mr. Nardozzi . He \'s a U.S. Attorney with the Justice Department who \'s familiar with your case . " // " My case . . . ? " Raab forced a hesitant smile , eyeing their thick files a little warily , not believing he was hearing that word . // " What we \'re going to do is ask you a few questions , Mr. Raab , " the Hispanic agent , Ruiz , began . " Please sit back down . I can assure you this will go a lot easier if we can count on your full cooperation and you simply answer truthfully and succinctly to the best of your knowledge . " // " Of course . " Raab nodded , sitting back down . // " And we \'re going to be taping this ,           a standard cassette recorder on the table , not even waiting for his response . " It \'s for your own protection , too . At any time , if you like , you can request that a lawyer be present . " // " I do n\'t need a lawyer . " Raab shook his head . " I have nothing to hide . " // " That \'s good , Mr. Raab . " Ruiz winked back affably . " These things have a way of always going best when people have nothing to hide . " // The agent removed a stack of papers from the file and ordered them in a certain way on the table . " You \'ve heard of a Paz Export Enterprises , Mr. Raab ? " he started in , turning the first page . // " Of course , " Raab confirmed . " They \'re one of my biggest accounts . " // " And just what is it you do for them ? " the FBI agent asked him . // " I purchase gold . On the           or something . I ship it to an intermediary on their behalf . " // " Argot Manufacturing ? " Ruiz interjected , turning over a page from his notes . // " Yes , Argot . Look , if that \'s what this is about- " // " And Argot does what with all this gold you purchase ? " Ruiz cut him off one more time . // " I do n\'t know . They \'re manufacturers . They turn it into gold plate , or whatever Paz requests . " // " Novelty items , " Ruiz said , cynically , looking up from his notes . // Raab stared back . " What they do with it is their business . I just buy the gold for them . " // " And how long have you been supplying gold to Argot on Paz \'s behalf ? " Agent in Charge Booth took up the questioning . // " I \'m not sure . I \'d have to check . Maybe six , eight years . . . " // " Six to eight years .           in all that time , Mr. Raab , you have no idea what products they make once they receive your gold ? " // It had the feel of a rhetorical question . But they seemed to be waiting for an answer . " They make a lot of things . " Raab shrugged . " For different customers . Jewelry . Gold-plated stuff , desk ornaments , paperweights . . . " // " They consume quite a lot of gold , " Booth said , running his eye down a column of numbers , " for a bunch of desk ornaments and paperweights , would n\'t you say ? Last year over thirty-one hundred pounds . At roughly six hundred forty dollars an ounce , that \'s over thirty-one million dollars , Mr. Raab. " // The number took Raab by surprise . He felt a bead of sweat run down his temple . He wet his lips . " I told you , I \'m in the transaction business . They give me a contract . All I do is supply the gold . Look , maybe           . " // Booth stared back , as if bemused , with a cynical smile , but a smile , it appeared to Raab , that had facts behind it . Ruiz opened his folder and removed some new sheets . Photographs . Black-and-white , eight-by-tens . The shots were all of mundane items . Bookends , paperweights , and some basic tools : hammers , screwdrivers , hoes. // " You recognize any of these items , Mr. Raab ? " // For the first time , Raab felt his heart start to accelerate . He warily shook his head . " No. " // " You receive payments from Argot , do n\'t you , Mr. Raab ? " Ruiz took him by surprise . " Kickbacks . . . " // " Commissions , " Raab corrected him , irritated at his tone . // " In addition to your commissions . " Ruiz kept his eyes on him . He slid another sheet across the table . " Commissions in the commodities market run , what ? One and a half , two percent ? Yours           Raab , is n\'t that right ? " // Ruiz kept his gaze fixed on him . Raab \'s throat suddenly went dry . He became aware he was fiddling with the gold Cartier cuff links Sharon had given him for his fiftieth birthday , and he stopped abruptly . His glance flicked back and forth among the three agents , trying to gauge what was in their minds . // " Like you said , they use a lot of gold , " he answered . " But what they do with it is their business . I just supply the gold . " // " What they do with it " -Agent Booth \'s voice grew hard , losing patience- " is they export it , Mr. Raab . These novelty items , as you say , they are n\'t made of steel or brass or gold plate . They \'re solid bullion , Mr. Raab . They \'re painted and anodized to make them look like ordinary items , as I suspect you know . Do you have any idea where these items end up , Mr.           I think . " Raab reached for his voice , which clung deep in his throat . " I told you , I just buy it for them . I \'m not sure I understand what \'s going on . " // " What \'s going on , Mr. Raab " -Booth leveled his eyes at him- " is that you \'ve already got one foot in a very deep bucket of shit , and I guess we just want to know , regarding the other , if it \'s in or out . You say you \'ve worked with Argot for between six and eight years . Do you know who owns the company ? " // " Harold Kornreich , " Raab answered more firmly . " I know Harold well . " // " Good . And what about Paz ? Do you know who runs that ? " // " I think his name is Spessa or something . Victor . I met him a few times . " // " Actually , Victor Spessa , whose real name is Victor Concerga " -Ruiz slid a           . The articles of incorporation , which Agent Ruiz is laying out for you , are from a Cayman Islands corporation , BKA Investments , Limited . " Ruiz spread out a few more photos on the table . Surveillance shots . The men looked clearly Hispanic . " Are any of these faces familiar to you , Mr. Raab ? " // Now Raab grew truly worried . A trickle of sweat cut a slow , cold path down his back . He picked up the photos , looked at them closely , one by one . He tremulously shook his head . " No. " // " Victor Concerga . Ramn Ramrez . Luis Trujillo , " the lead FBI man said . " These individuals are listed as the key officers of BKA , to whom the simple household products your gold is converted into are consigned . Trujillo , " Ruiz said , pushing across a surveillance shot of a stocky man in a fancy suit climbing into a Mercedes , " is one of the leading money managers for the Mercado family in the Colombian           echoed . His eyes bulged wide . // " And just to be clear , Mr. Raab . " Agent Ruiz winked . " We \'re not talking the B-school here . " // Raab stared at them , his jaw in his lap . // " The gold you purchase , Mr. Raab , on behalf of Paz , is melted down and cast into ordinary household items , then plated over or painted and shipped back to Colombia , where it is reconstituted into bullion . Paz is just a sham operation . It is one hundred percent owned by the Mercado drug cartel . The money they pay you . . . for your-transactions , \' as you call them , is derived from the business of narcotics distribution . The gold you supply " -the agent widened his eyes- " is how they ship it home . " // " No ! " Raab leaped up , this time eyes fiery , defiant . " I have nothing to do with that . I swear . I supply gold . That \'s all . I have           a lot of people do . If you \'re trying to scare me , okay , you got my attention . It \'s working ! But Colombians . . . Mercados . . . " He shook his head . " No way . What the hell do you think is going on here ? " // Booth just rubbed his jaw as if he had n\'t heard a word Raab had been saying . " When Mr. Concerga came to you , Mr. Raab , he said he wanted to do exactly what ? " // " He said he needed to buy gold . He wanted to convert it into certain items . " // " And how was it that in order to do that he was first introduced to Argot Manufacturing ? " // Raab recoiled . He saw it now . Clearly . Where this was starting to lead . Argot was owned by his friend . Harold . He had introduced them . // And for years Raab had been paid handsomely for having set up the deal . // That was when Nardozzi           point remained silent , leaned forward , saying , " You understand the definition of money laundering , do n\'t you , Mr. Raab ? " // Continues ... \n Alex does n\'t love you ? Just flip off the love switch and presto : you do n\'t love him either . Charlie needs his space ? Pull a small lever and he \'ll be on a reverse-less rocket ship en route to the stratosphere where he can have all the space he wants . // Imagine what your life would be like if you had a switch , an interrupter of sorts , located somewhere in an unobtrusive part of your body , let \'s say on your calf , like a tattoo . See yourself pressing this lever , pin , or button and being able to control the most uncontrollable part of your body : your heart . // You would n\'t suffer over what is n\'t good for you . You would n\'t cry for what can not be . You \'d just live . You \'d be happy . // And while we \'re imagining , just think of the effect this " love switch " would have on the rest of humanity . // Hundreds of suicides and even more homicides would be avoided . Salacious newspaper accounts of the latest crime of           ever become abusive , inconvenient , or , worse , devoid of magic , we \'d all be capable of just letting go . We \'d have time to pursue happiness and the energy to enjoy life . // And when the person who meant everything to you told you he did n\'t love you anymore and sent you to Hell without a quiver , you \'d be able to smile , wish him luck , and say " all \'s well that ends well , " or even " everything happens for a reason . " // " A million dollars , " I said , staring back at them steadily in spite of my nerves . // Martin \'s mouth dropped open like a tire jack while the Lilliputian gnome at his side almost choked on his own tongue . // But let \'s leave them in shock for a moment while I bring you up to date . Freeze frame , as they say in the movies . // My name is Erika Luna , I live in Miami , and the man I \'ve just frozen           the tall guy in his late -- but interesting -- thirties , salt and pepper hair , wide back , and " owner of the world " attitude . // The mustached pigmy at his side was Attorney Chavez , the lawyer he \'d hired to divorce me. // And there we all were in February , the month of love-induced chocolate and flower purchases , sitting in that white , flavorless office full of leather seats and framed diplomas , about to " negotiate " the end of seven years of marriage , against my will . // When he \'d recuperated , Attorney Chavez , whose basic function in life is to be my husband \'s human speech articulation system , looked at me condescendingly. // " I \'m sorry ... so sorry ... I apologize ... you \'re asking for a million dollars becaaaaause ... Okay , never mind . I \'m going to have to apologize ... again ... for my lack of understanding , but ... I do n\'t get it , and I have to tell you that even if you were able to           the state of Florida . You can make things difficult , play baseball , as they say here , and that \'s your choice , as long as you know it \'s my job to make sure that when all is said and done , you \'re the one paying a million dollars ... in legal fees . " // I was about to ask Martin if he paid Chavez to speak in clichs , and if so , to demand that his lawyer threaten me with the correct ones , as I \'ve never played baseball in my life and was still pretty sure he meant hardball. // But before I could open my mouth , my own lawyer , who \'d spent hours convincing me that the best way to make a man desist from divorce is to scare him with the possibility of losing a substantial amount of money , stopped her flirting for an instant , stepped away from the oval-shaped conference table , and , with the resolute air of one who charges two hundred and fifty dollars an hour , walked over to the           " You \'ll have to excuse me if I do n\'t allow you to intimidate my client in my own office . It \'s been a pleasure , gentlemen , " she said with a seductive smile . // " Please , forgive me , if I \'ve offended you , " said Chavez getting up from his chair and slithering over to where Attorney Lopez stood . " I hope , you know ... it certainly was n\'t my intention to offend such a beautiful woman , " he continued , arching his neck a hundred and twenty degrees to impress her with all of his five feet , two inches of sensuality . // " Apology accepted , but when I finish digging in every last corner of your client \'s life , what a judge will award this woman will come quite close to that amount . You can choose not to believe me , leave through those doors right now , and find I \'m right ... in court , " she countered , charmingly , of course . // It was Martin who jumped like           the word " court " was mentioned . // " There \'s a name for what you \'re doing , Erika . Extortion . Ex-tor-tion ! " he emphasized as if I were retarded . // " And what you \'ve done ? What \'s that called ? Let me see ... Oh , I know ! In-fi-de-li-ty ! Chea-ting , Pe-gar-los-cuer-nos , po-ner los-ta-rros -- " // " Of course ... here comes the victim . Look , if I had a million dollars , I \'d seriously consider using them to hire a hit man , " he spit out , exasperated . " What do you want ? The house ? There . It \'s yours , " he added , throwing a heavy handful of keys on the table . " What else ? My car ? Here \'s the damn car , " he said , taking another set of keys , this time from his suit jacket , and throwing them on the table with the others , creating a shrill metallic clang that sounded like a bunch of screaming baby birds being forced           that ? Overnight ? " I asked as I searched for balance while standing on that rope connecting " I still love you " to " I wish I \'d never set eyes on you . " // " Erika , we \'ve been at this for a month now . It \'s not \' overnight . \' " // Of course , to him a month was n\'t overnight compared to seven years of marriage and another one dating . The fact that we made love three times the night before I found out there were three people in my marriage did n\'t qualify for ironic in his eyes . That when this happened we were in the middle of extending our living room to eliminate our family room so we could use the extra space to remodel the terrace did n\'t seem to him reason enough that I should be surprised to be in this mass-divorce-factory of an office only a month later . // I looked into his face , at his black eyes now surrounded by tiny blue lines -- brought on , I suspected ,           of his temples . I looked at the ends of his salt and pepper hair standing up gladiator style . I looked and , for a second , remembered the simplest things about our life together : nights watching TV while eating ice cream in bed , laughing like idiots at some joke on Everybody Loves Raymond . // I remembered how he \'d always kiss my nose and say , " It does n\'t matter . We \'ll just go out to eat , " whenever I burned , smoked , or undercooked whatever grand culinary production I had insisted on making . // That was the Martin I knew , and the one I continued to look for in his stare , in his stance . I walked into the field of his anger , stubbornly looking for a gesture or a signal , something from the happy life I thought I \'d had with him , anything that would allow me to understand and forgive him . // Nothing . // I took the keys and extended them to him without taking my eyes from his .           . // But he just evaded me . Taking the keys , he glanced at his Rolex Submariner , and with that simple gesture he assumed the pose of a man busy with a thousand things more important than I. // " Look , Erika , I \'m not a psychologist . If you want to make a career out of this , go right ahead . Frankly , I wo n\'t continue to blah , blah , blah .... " // I could n\'t tell you what he said after that . // During the weeks before that moment , I had put a lot of time and effort into fighting back my rage , telling myself you do n\'t throw away a marriage you \'ve been happy in for over seven years at the first problem . I \'d spent entire nights overpowering my own desire to run him and his lover over with my Jetta , several times , like that Colombian dentist did in Texas . And each night , I \'d end up praying , talking myself calm , and telling myself that if I           right . // But the days passed , and Martin never showed up at the house in the middle of a rainstorm , repentant . Nor did he call at dawn just because he missed me . He never asked for my forgiveness , and it was clear he had no intention of doing so . // How did I feel ? Like Mano de Piedra Durn must have felt when Sugar Ray Leonard landed the punch that would make him say " No ms . " My head repeated , what did he say ? What ? A career out of this gigantic piece of mierda he was dumping on my lap ? // I understood , then what people mean when they say their head " fogged up . " How could I not when I had enough fog in mine to prevent a whole airline from landing in the widest and clearest of landing strips ? // " Mira , desgraaaaaaaaciado , " I said taking off one of the Marc Jacobs platform wedge shoes I \'d scored on eBay and throwing it at him . "           " ( shoe reaching opposite wall with a thud ) " damn the time of day you were born , " ( cat-sized paperweight picked up and thrown ) , " damn the time of day I met you " ( cat-sized paperweight landing on Martin \'s foot ) , " and damn -- " // " Erika , stop this right now ! " screamed Martin , using his briefcase as a shield and jumping on one foot while trying to rescue the papers he \'d laid on the table . " The consummate scientist ... quite the professional for some things , but in the end , like the Puerto Rican country girl you are ... you mess up ... you either mess up when you get there , or you mess up as you \'re leaving , but you mess up . " // " Country girl your mother , you fermented piece of cow dung , " I screamed . " You just wait , because when I \'m finished with you , you \'ll have to be a full-time pimp to that piece of war-time           " " Erika , I wo n\'t stand for ... " // But he stood for it . And he continued to stand for it until much after lawyer Chavez threatened to call the police . I kept flinging insults and curses at him even when my own lawyer threatened to fire me as a client if I did n\'t sit down and stop screaming . // I did n\'t care . A Ph.D . in chemistry and all Martin had to do was look at me as if I were a plate of leftover food to turn me into a screaming maniac. // And scream I did , right up until both men ran out , a cloud of disordered divorce papers on their arms . I screamed and screamed until I lost my voice and my lawyer had the brilliant idea of threatening to call my father . // Then I walked out onto the street and into the first caf I saw , heading straight for the bathroom , not thinking , feeling , or seeing anything . Not the washbasin \'s porcelain border as I bent           I splashed on my face . Not even the hum of the wall-mounted hand dryer someone had left on . I sensed nothing other than the " he \'s gone ... it \'s over ... he \'s gone ... it \'s over " playing in my head . // In the mirror , my coffee-colored hair , long and always too curly , looked as if I \'d been coiffed by Diana Ross \'s hairstylist in her heyday . My lips , normally quite plump , were so swollen they resembled a puddle of reddish-purple blood with a stab wound in the middle . And my eyes , usually almond-shaped , had acquired a watery , shapeless form and were speckled with several very obvious red cracks , clearly visible through my tortoiseshell eyeglasses. // " I \'m sorry , " I told the woman in the mirror . She was crying an airless , difficult cry , like a premature baby who senses that the slightest sniffle could kill him . // When I managed to calm down , I realized Martin was right . I was a woman           , facts , and reason . How could I allow heartbreak -- so common it would be a clich if it were n\'t happening to me -- turn me into a raving lunatic ? // I walked out , sat at the counter , and ordered coffee from a waitress so engrossed in conversation with her colleague that she barely noticed me. // " And then I told him , \' Look here , mijito ... What are you thinking ? That I \'m a twenty-four-hour fast-food sex window available at your convenience ? No , baby . You \'re wrong . Te equivocaste . \' " // " Very mistaken , " nodded the other waitress . " Better lonely que mal acompaada , " she added as she spread butter on six Cuban toasts , a resigned expression on her face . // Had my best friend Lola been there , she \'d have said I was attracting the very thing I was suffering from . You know , the radiations of negative thought and all that hooey . // But there must have been some truth to           to drink four Cuban coffees and two bottled waters , I saw ... 1 . A young guy begging his girlfriend for another chance using a cell phone that lost his call five times during the ten minutes he was waiting for a breaded-steak dinner . // 2 . A depressed-looking pregnant woman pretending not to notice her husband turning around one hundred and eighty degrees to stare at the ample behind of a woman ordering a pan con lechn sandwich and a malted milkshake. // 3 . At least five people walking past the cafeteria \'s entrance with the automated sprint of being fed up with life , and the same empty stare that had made me cry when I \'d seen it staring back at me in the restroom mirror just minutes before . // Too many samples of the bad substance , as they say in my line of work . Or maybe it was n\'t that I was attracting that which I was going through . Perhaps this was just the way things were -- a world full of malfunctioning , broken hearts ambling around --           occupied living in my yuppie love bubble , located right in the middle of a house that was always being painted , extended , decorated , or improved . // Hours later , I was still driving aimlessly around Miami , thinking about how desperately the world needed an interrupter for bad love as I alternated between good and bad neighborhoods , busy and empty areas . // It was a revolting piece of truth , but you do n\'t automatically stop loving someone just because he breaks your heart . You keep loving and carrying around the clunker of a heart your son-of-a-bitch ex-husband broke in two so carelessly and without so much as an ounce of anesthesia. // It must have been close to midnight by the time I drove home and parked , staying in the car , fantasizing in exquisite detail how I \'d get the vengeance my half-asleep brain wanted . // I promised myself that I would come up with a plan so ingenious , so diabolical , it would no doubt make me the absolute leader of humiliated wives and broken hearts the           Years would pass before the liars , cheaters , and players of the world stopped whispering my name in pool halls , remembering with fear the only other occasion in which an obscure member of their club -- one John Bobbitt -- had dragged them all toward disaster . // Comforted by this thought , I went up to my bedroom , threw myself on the bed with my shoes still on , and was asleep before my thought-heavy head plummeted onto the pillow . // Despair is the most effective of sleeping aids , and that night I dreamed that dozens of little men , their small brains hanging between their legs , tried in vain to erase my name from some huge international directory of forgotten wives . \n 1 // Several months before I was scheduled to leave for *** , I was assigned to the *** office in *** Division . Depending on scheduling and other bureaucratic considerations , new case officers *** . In my case , I was shipping out in August , so I would be in *** for most of the summer . // It was a busy time in *** , but the officers running country desks liked to handle their own work . They \'d give me an occasional name trace to run , or have me coordinate a cable with another division . But I was n\'t busy . I \'d read the morning traffic-cables from the stations in *** , and whatever *** traffic was coming in . I \'d stop by my friends \' offices throughout the building or meet them for coffee in the cafeteria . And one or two days a week , I \'d take care of various tasks I had to accomplish before going abroad , like *** and getting my final medical clearance . // Other than that , I spent a lot of time reading . I had a stack of           *** , and I wanted to get through them all before I left . People at the Agency were n\'t really " book people , " and when colleagues stopped by my cubicle and saw me reading , they \'d usually chuckle or say , " Good for you , " in a sort of half- admiring , half " I wonder if you really belong here " way . This was the same attitude I \'d gotten from the Chief of *** when I \'d needed him to sign off on an *** course I wanted to take at the *** Department . He \'d said , " Nobody ever takes these , " although after thinking about it for a few seconds he \'d signed and said , " See if you get anything out of it . " // One day , the Deputy Chief of *** , a bland , decent guy stuck at GS-13 or 14 , called me into his office . There \'d been some sort of routine request from Congress about *** and *** , and he wanted me to do a           active and inactive , going back five years , to find the information . He was apologetic about it , since even the words " file review " implied something wasteful and dull . But I did n\'t mind . I \'d read a few case files while working on various matters , and they were an interesting window into the work I \'d be doing once I went abroad . // The office \'s files were stored in long , low cabinets that ran the length of the wall between the Deputy Chief and the Chief \' s offices . There were probably about *** of them , going back ten years . Inactive cases older than that were sent to Archives . *** labeled TRBALLOON , pronouncing both of the first two letters , and then the word . *** either typed on a label or written directly on the folder . They varied in length , with the longer ones filling two or three of the orange folders . // Over the next few days , I \'d grab an armful of files in the morning ,           , and get another batch for the afternoon . I really could have just scanned them to get the information I needed , but as I said , I liked reading them , and nobody particularly cared , or even noticed , how much time I was taking with the assignment . // Like all CIA employees in the Directorate of Operations ( DO ) , I had a Top Secret clearance , which meant that I was cleared to see almost anything . Certain types of information required a special *** clearance- *** . But if you were working on something where that clearance was required , your boss signed a slip , you handed it in to Security , and a day later you had the clearance . It was n\'t really a big deal . // There was the idea of " need to know , " which meant that you should n\'t see , hear , or read about anything you did n\'t need to know about in order to do your job . But this was largely ignored . If you were sitting with a           tell each other about the cases you were working on . You might not do it at a table of five people , but if your boss knew you were talking to other officers about your cases , he almost certainly would n\'t care . He did it , too . The environment was surprisingly open within the Directorate . And in a sense , learning about a wide variety of cases would help you understand your job better , so you could even make an argument that you " sort of needed to know . " // In any case , I had no real need to know about the details of these cases I was reading . But I was cleared for them , and they were within my division , and even my office , so I did n\'t hide the fact that I was reading them much more carefully than I needed to . // Each of the files contained the cable traffic *** . In a lot of the cases , it was determined after a few encounters that the target was n\'t susceptible to           classified information . These were the thin files . In other cases , there were multiple meetings , and a relationship developed that often produced some intelligence , but the case never turned into a full-blown recruitment . These files were a little bit thicker . Finally , in some cases , an agent was recruited and either run for a period of time or was still being run . These files could be anywhere from *** to *** pages , depending , presumably , on the Chief of Station ( COS ) and his attitude about Headquarters . Some COSs saw Headquarters as troublesome , bureaucratic , and meddlesome , and felt that only the broad outlines of a case should be reported . Others obviously encouraged their case officers ( C/Os ) to write in great detail about every aspect of a case , either because it forced the C/Os to be clear and rigorous in their thinking , or as a cover-your-ass maneuver in case something went wrong . // These more detailed files were , of course , the ones I liked reading the most .           great detail-what the target or agent was wearing , what their facial expressions were like , how they responded to what the case officer said and did . In just a few months , I \'d be running meetings like this , and these real-world examples were an education in how much less formal and systematic the recruitment process was than the way it had been taught in training . // In addition to the operational cables , a file might or might not include intelligence reports . Unlike the other traffic , these *** . It was the information you were actually after when you recruited an agent in the first place . Whether there were a lot of them or just a few of them in the file depended on whether or not the officer at Headquarters in charge of the case was conscientious about putting them in . Most of the intel reports that were there were pretty dull , and it was hard to imagine them being that useful to an analyst . Friends in the Directorate of Intelligence ( DI ) had told me that           of an impact on their analysis , and I could see why . On the other hand , there was an occasional nugget of information that seemed enormously important and useful . // 2 // About a week into the file review , I opened a folder labeled TDTRACER ( all the cryptonyms , pseudonyms , and names in this book have been changed ) . The top cable was stamped *** , which was a complete surprise . My heart started racing a little bit as soon as I saw it . *** cables were more compartmentalized than other traffic , and normally they would n\'t be in a regular file . I had n\'t seen any of these since starting at the Agency , except to sign for their delivery to the office once or twice . I \'d certainly never read one . Arguably , I should n\'t read this one without getting clearance , but here it was in front of me , and I was supposed to be doing the file review . // The cable had originated in *** , where I was going           , obviously , particularly interested in cases that took place there , especially more recent ones where the agent might still be active . The cable was dated June 2000 , so it was certainly possible that it dealt with an agent who was still being run ( this was the summer of 2002 ) . Under the date was the normal range of headers- *** written by a C/O with the pseudonym Franklin D. McCelvoy and then the text of the cable , which ran more or less as follows ( *** ) *** // AS PART OF ONGOING EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE WHEREABOUTS OF STATION ASSET TDTRACER , C/O FRANKLIN D.

I went to the end of the file and started reading back to front , in the order in which the cables came in ( new cables were added to the top of a file , so they ended up bound in their folders in reverse chronological order ) . TDTRACER was a *** national , working as a *** at the embassy in *** . A C/O with the pseudonym Andrew L. Seegram had met him at a conference the *** government had set up on foreign investment . He \'d written TDTRACER up as a target with primary access to information on *** economic policy . But he \'d also written that TRACER might develop into           at the time , even before September 11 ) . *** was fighting a separatist movement in * , and their intel service , the * , collected extensively on worldwide terrorism . The hope was that TRACER might have , or might develop , intelligence ser vice contacts within the embassy , or come across some information simply by virtue of being in the embassy . It might have been a bit of a stretch , but adding terrorism to the targets a potential agent might work against helped ensure Headquarters \' approval for pursuing a recruitment . // Seegram initially suggested to TRACER that they get together to discuss their respective countries \' interest in a trade pact with *** . They had lunch , and when it went well , Seegram suggested they get together again . Over the course of several more meetings , they became quite friendly . TRACER was guarded when discussing *** and his work at the embassy , but that was to be expected . Seegram was concerned that TRACER might be an intelligence agent himself , developing Seegram for recruitment .           been a double agent the *** was dangling . But these were always potential concerns , and as Seegram and TRACER spent more time together-primarily lunches and dinners at local restaurants-Seegram became increasingly convinced TRACER was neither an intel officer nor a double agent . Much of this was based on intuition , which is not considered a reliable guide in intelligence . But especially in the early stages of a recruitment , there often is n\'t much else to go on . // The cables went into less and less detail as the development of TRACER went on . Presumably , Seegram started to ask more and more questions about *** policy and what went on at the embassy , and TRACER responded . In a textbook case , TRACER would eventually cross a line where he was revealing things he should not have been . Seegram would continue to gently guide him down this path . Eventually a formal recruitment would take place . // However it did progress , a cable in December said that TDTRACER had been formally recruited . Subsequent cables ticked off the C/           their relationship into a fully clandestine mode , moving all meetings to secure locations . He trained TDTRACER in the fundamentals of tradecraft , including *** . A form of payment was set up , *** by the case officer . // The operational cables now began to be interspersed with intelligence reports . There were three or four of them on *** economic policy , none spectacularly interesting but one or two containing information that seemed like it would have been of interest to analysts working on ***. // Seegram and TRACER had had five or six meetings since his recruitment , over the course *** , when the cable traffic written by Seegram suddenly stopped . Seegram \'s last cable detailed a fairly ordinary meeting at which *** . Then came McCelvoy \'s *** cable , dated two weeks later , in which he reported that TDTRACER was still missing and that the station was losing confidence in the case officer with the pseudonym " Seegram. " // I went back to the file cabinet to see if there was another TDTRACER folder . Sometimes folders were misfiled           there was nothing else there . // Back at my desk , I turned to McCelvoy \'s cable again . I found the line that was sticking in my head : " SUBJECT COULD CURRENTLY BE LOCATED IN *** EMBASSY IN *** OR NEIGHBORING COUNTRY WHILE UNDERGOING INTERROGATION , *** , OR ANYWHERE IN *** OR THE *** . " It was quite a list of possibilities . // 3 // There was a contractor working in *** named William . There were a fair number of these guys around , retired case officers who got bored in retirement and came back to work desks in their old Divisions . William was more impressive than most of them . He was probably as close as there was to a George Smiley at the Agency , meaning he was extremely smart and highly compassionate . He also looked the part of the wise old hand , with white hair and square , chunky glasses . // William had taken me under his wing as soon as I \'d arrived in the office . Everyone at the Agency was friendly-you called your           of the Division knew my name . It was a requirement of the culture that you be nice , and people knew how to do it . But William \'s kindness felt more genuine . He asked questions about my personal life and talked to me about things that had nothing to do with the Agency . He went down to the cafeteria with me for lunch at least once a week . He even invited me to his house for an anniversary party where there were only eight or nine guests . Several of them were very high-ranking Agency officers , and William introduced me to them as " an extremely promising young C/O . " // I was also fortunate because William \'s final tour before retirement had been as Chief of Station in * . I asked him endless questions about the operational environment and the people and the customs , and I felt the things I was learning would allow me to hit the ground running when I got there . // The day after I read the TRACER file , I went over to William           motioned for me to sit down . // " I \'m working on the file review , " I said . // " How \'s it coming ? " he asked . // " Not bad . I \'m getting there . I ran into this case-TDTRACER. " // William nodded slightly . // " You remember it ? " I said . // " Bobby Goldstein \'s case . " // " He was the C/O ? " // " Yup , " William said . // " Andrew L. Seegram ? " // " I think that was his pseudonym . It sounds right . " // " You were COS then ? " // William nodded . // " It \'s funny , the last cable is * . And it \'s by a different C/O . From the way it was written , I thought it might be from the DCOS " -Deputy Chief of Station- " or something . I hope it was okay that I read it . " // ( Continues ... ) // \n Introduction The Most Dangerous City in America // O oh , Las Vegas , " sang the pioneering country-rocker Gram Parsons . " Every time I hit your Crystal City , you know you \'re gon na make a wreck out of me . " As Las Vegans , we regularly read about these wrecked lives in newspapers and magazines . We routinely observe people going about their wildly destructive antics on mainstream TV . Often we ca n\'t believe these stories are unfolding in our city . They almost seem like put-ons , elaborate pranks borrowed from atrocious cut-rate screenplays . But there they are , these inhabitants of our city , their mug shots staring us down , making us wonder if what Parsons said is really true-that in Las Vegas your only real friend is the queen of spades . // How crazy does crime get in Las Vegas ? Well , consider these tales taken from local papers : // Husband-and-wife champion bodybuilders strangle their personal assistant , torching her body in a red Jaguar in the Vegas desert . Eventually police apprehend the couple in a shopping center , where the killers are drinking           to sexually assault a female parishioner , a Catholic priest clobbers his intended victim with a wine bottle before going on the lam . According to a police report , he tells the church worker , her consciousness fading , " I am over the edge . " // And then there \'s this : O.J. Simpson , who years ago was found " not guilty " of decapitating his wife and her lover , storms into a hotel room with armed accomplices to " retrieve items that belonged to him , " sports memorabilia like his Hall of Fame certificate and photos of him standing beside J. Edgar Hoover . // On it goes , a litany of wicked behavior and stupid folly . People come from all over the world to do dumb , dangerous things in Sin City , whether it \'s someone locking himself in a Fremont Street motel to kick a nasty heroin habit , hooking up to an oxygen tank in a last-ditch scheme to double his nest egg at the downtown slots , or shooting a weekend porn flick that goes disastrously wrong           true-life narratives , no one shows up in Las Vegas to do anything smart , tactful , or even kind . Instead , they come here to fuck up . Big time . // The sheer range of true Las Vegas crime-no doubt spurred on by the city \'s explosive growth ( which recently passed the two million mark ) -can be intimidating to crime writers and readers alike . How can literary fiction surpass the strangeness of this place ? Indeed , it takes a lot to top the gaudy spectacle that is Las Vegas , and we \'re happy to report that the writers who contributed to this volume have done just that . They \'ve beaten the odds to conjure characters and stories that transcend any of the lurid dramas of Vegas you \'ll read about in newspapers or watch on the tube . // The stories gathered in Las Vegas Noir are written by longtime residents and avid chroniclers of Sin City , authors who take you far beyond the neon of Caesars Palace and into neighborhoods too dangerous for CSI . Absolutely clich-free , these           that only real Las Vegas neighborhoods can spring . // The late John O\'Brien , author of Leaving Las Vegas , gives us the story " The Tik , " in which a junkie hooked on a mysterious drug reunites with his wealthy ex-lover to embark on a thrill-killing expedition . In David Corbett \'s mystifying " Pretty Little Parasite , " a Fremont Street cocktail waitress plagued by Holocaust nightmares believes coke dealing is the best way to become a stay-at-home mom . In Lori Kozlowski \'s " Three Times a Night , Every Other Night , " an Irish pub singer banished to North Las Vegas and at the end of his professional rope is destined for a mobbed-up fate . Jaq Greenspon \'s " Disappear " centers on a down-and-out magician whose former assistant steals money-and may be fingering him to the bad guys . And in Celeste Starr \'s chilling " Dirty Blood , " a simple pickup in a gay bar takes an unusual twist when the protagonist finds more than lubricant in his date \'s sock drawer . // There is plenty of heartbreak           . In Tod Goldberg \'s " Mitzvah , " for instance , a con man masquerading as a rabbi feels trapped in the suburbs until he plans a brutal means of escape . In Scott Phillips \'s " Babs , " an ex-stripper turned bar owner drags along a visiting Midwestern cartoon aficionado to reclaim some meth for a mutual friend . And Vu Tran \'s devastating " This or Any Desert " explores the fractured psyche of a renegade cop looking to avenge his Asian ex-wife \'s physical abuse at the hands of her new husband , a Chinatown businessman , with searing emotional and psychological insight . // Like we said , as fantastic and diverse as the Strip can be at night , it \'s got nothing on the vast array of stories collected here . Indeed , Las Vegas Noir , as you will soon discover , brings you into the gaudy bosom of our fair city-that is , the gaudy , lethal bosom that eventually presents itself once you wander far away from the Strip . // Jarret Keene & Todd James Pierce Las Vegas           \n ONE <br> Garmisch , Germany <br> Tuesday , December 11 , The Present <br> 1:40 pm <br> Cotton Malone hated enclosed spaces . <br> His current unease was amplified by a packed cable car . Most of the passengers were on vacation , dressed in colorful garb , shouldering poles and skis . He sensed a variety of nationalities . Some Italians , a few Swiss , a handful of French , but mainly Germans . He \'d been one of the first to climb aboard and , to relieve his discomfort , he \'d made his way close to one of the frosty windows . Ten thousand feet above and closing , the Zugspitze stood silhouetted against a steel- blue sky , the imposing gray summit draped in a late- autumn snow . <br> Not smart , agreeing to this location . <br> The car continued its giddy ascent , passing one of several steel tres &shy; tles that rose from the rocky crags . <br> He was unnerved , and not simply from the crowded surroundings . Ghosts awaited him atop Germany \'s highest peak . He \'d avoided this rendezvous for nearly four decades . People           should not help it from the grave so easily . <br> Yet here he was , doing exactly that . <br> Vibrations slowed as the car entered , then stopped at the summit station . <br> Skiers flooded off toward another lift that would take them down to a high- altitude corrie , where a chalet and slopes waited . He did n\'t ski , never had , never wanted to . <br> He made his way through the visitor center , identified by a yellow placard as Mncher Haus . A restaurant dominated one half of the building , the rest housed a theater , a snack bar , an observatory , souvenir shops , and a weather station . <br> He pushed through thick glass doors and stepped out onto a railed terrace . Bracing Alpine air stung his lips . According to Stephanie Nelle his contact should be waiting on the observation deck . One thing was obvious . Ten thousand feet in the high Alps certainly added a height &shy; ened measure of privacy to their meeting . <br> The Zugspitze lay on the border .           To the north spanned a soup- bowl valley ringed by rock- ribbed peaks . A gauze of frosty mist shielded the German vil &shy; lage of Garmisch and its companion , Partenkirchen . Both were sports meccas , and the region catered not only to skiing but also bobsledding , skating , and curling . <br> More sports he \'d avoided . <br> The observation deck was deserted save for an elderly couple and a few skiers who \'d apparently paused to enjoy the view . He \'d come to solve a mystery , one that had preyed on his mind ever since that day when the men in uniforms came to tell his mother that her husband was dead . <br> " Contact was lost with the submarine forty- eight hours ago . We dispatched search and rescue ships to the North Atlantic , which have combed the last known position . Wreckage was found six hours ago . We waited to tell the families until we were sure there was no chance of survivors . " <br> <br> His mother had never cried . Not her way .           Years passed before questions formed in his teenage mind . The government offered little explanation beyond official re &shy; leases . When he \'d first joined the navy he \'d tried to access the court of inquiry \'s investigative report on the sub \'s sinking , but learned it was classified . He \'d tried again after becoming a Justice Department agent , possessed of a high security clearance . No luck . When Gary , his fifteen-year- old , visited over the summer , he \'d faced new questions . Gary had never known his grandfather , but the boy had wanted to know more about him and , especially , how he died . The press had covered the sink &shy; ing of the USS Blazek in November 1971 , so they \'d read many of the old accounts on the Internet . Their talk had rekindled his own doubts -- enough that he \'d finally done something about them . <br> He plunged balled fists into his parka and wandered the terrace . <br> Telescopes dotted the railing . At one stood a woman , her dark           in a bright outfit , skis and poles propped beside her , studying the valley below . <br> He casually walked over . One rule he \'d learned long ago . Never hurry . It only bred trouble . <br> " Quite a scene , " he said . <br> She turned . " Certainly is . " <br> Her face was the color of cinnamon which , combined with what he regarded as Egyptian features in her mouth , nose , and eyes signaled some Middle Eastern ancestry . <br> " I \'m Cotton Malone . " <br> " How did you know I was the one who came to meet you ? " <br> He motioned at the brown envelope lying at the base of the tele &shy; scope . " Apparently this is not a high- pressure mission . " He smiled . " Just running an errand ? " <br> " Something like that . I was coming to ski . A week off , finally . Al &shy; ways wanted to do it . Stephanie asked if I could bring " -- she motioned at           back to her viewing . " You mind if I finish this ? It cost a euro and I want to see what \'s down there . " <br> She revolved the telescope , studying the German valley that stretched for miles below . <br> " You have a name ? " he asked . <br> " Jessica , " she said , her eyes still to the eyepiece . <br> He reached for the envelope . <br> Her boot blocked the way . " Not yet . Stephanie said to make sure you understand that the two of you are even . " <br> Last year he \'d helped out his old boss in France . She \'d told him then that she owed him a favor and that he should use it wisely . <br> And he had . <br> " Agreed . Debt paid . " <br> She turned from the telescope . Wind reddened her cheeks . " I \'ve heard about you at the Magellan Billet . A bit of a legend . One of the original twelve agents . " <br> " I did           Stephanie said you were modest , too . " <br> He was n\'t in the mood for compliments . The past awaited him . " Could I have the file ? " <br> Her eyes sparked . " Sure . " <br> He retrieved the envelope . The first thought that flashed through his mind was how something so thin might answer so many questions . <br> " That must be important , " she said . <br> Another lesson . Ignore what you do n\'t want to answer . " You been with the Billet long ? " <br> " Couple of years . " She stepped from the telescope mount . " Do n\'t like it , though . I \'m thinking about getting out . I hear you got out early , too . " <br> As carelessly as she handled herself , quitting seemed like a good ca &shy; reer move . During his twelve years he \'d taken only three vacations , during which he \'d stayed on constant guard . Paranoia was one of many occupational hazards that came with being an agent ,           the malady . <br> " Enjoy the skiing , " he said to her . <br> Tomorrow he \'d fly back to Copenhagen . Today he was going to make a few stops at the rare- book shops in the area -- an occupational hazard of his new profession . Bookseller . <br> She threw him a glare as she grabbed her skis and poles . " I plan to . " <br> They left the terrace and walked back through the nearly deserted visitor center . Jessica headed for the lift that would take her down to the corrie . He headed for the cable car that would drop him ten thou &shy; sand feet back to ground level . <br> He stepped into the empty car , holding the envelope . He liked the fact that no one was aboard . But just before the doors closed , a man and woman rushed on , hand in hand . The attendant slammed the doors shut from the outside and the car eased from the station . <br> He stared out the forward windows . <br> Enclosed spaces were           He was n\'t claustrophobic . More a sense of freedom denied . He \'d tolerated it in the past -- having found himself underground on more than one occasion -- but his discomfort was one reason why , years ago , when he joined the navy , unlike his father , he had n\'t opted for submarines . " Mr. Malone . " He turned . The woman stood , holding a gun . " I \'ll take that envelope . " <br> Continues ... \n PROLOGUE', 'It was beastly hot weather , as Juniper remarked to Captain Lysander out on the veranda of the officers \' mess , fit for little more than an odd gin and tonic , perhaps the lazy composition of a letter home . The flies , maddening creatures that had never learned to take no for an answer , crowded around the nets that blocked the porch , searching for a way in . " I would trade a hand to be back in London , " Lysander said to Juniper after a long pause . " At least they have the decency to bar these flies from coming into the city there .

What ?', 'There ... that was it . Something colorful , a quarter mile ahead , sat by the side of the road at the base of one of the hills of sand that cut off the view of Monterey Bay .', 'He hit           the right shoulder . He parked with the hood of the Ford pointed leftward toward traffic , so a rear-ender would shove the car away from , not over , him , and climbed out . Stuck in the sand just beyond the shoulder was a cross -- a roadside memorial . It was about eighteen inches high and homemade , cobbled together out of dark , broken-off branches , bound with wire like florists use . Dark red roses lay in a splashy bouquet at the base . A cardboard disk was in the center , the date of the accident written on it in blue ink . There were no names on the front or back .', 'Usually the memorials were tasteful and poignant . This one was spooky .', "The trooper thought about removing the cross , but the mourners might return to leave another one and endanger themselves again . Best just to leave it . Out of curiosity he 'd check with his sergeant in the morning and find out what had happened . He walked back to his car , tossed his hat on the seat and rubbed his crew cut . He pulled back into traffic , his mind no longer on roadside accidents . He was thinking about what his wife would be making for supper , about taking the kids to the pool afterward .", 'That was curious . Whoever had left the roadside cross had made a mistake . He remembered that the date crudely written on the cardboard disk was June 26 , Tuesday , tomorrow .', "Then the images of the eerie cross faded , though they didn'tvanish completely and , as the officer headed down the highway home , he drove a bit more carefully .", 'I shoulda known better . But I guess life would be boring if we had all the answers . How about half the answers ? Maybe that would have kept my butt out of the gigantic sling it ended up in .', "But if you ca n't drink champagne at your daughter 's wedding , when can you ? Amber 's wedding -- it 's been two years and it still seems impossible she could be married . My little girl looked so beautiful I had to pinch myself to keep from boohooing . That day she and J.J. -- Baby Son-in-Law I call him , because he still has a face like his fourth-grade picture -- made a whole bunch of promises to love , honor and           was n't my little girl anymore . She was J.J. 's wife . My own vows did n't hit me that hard .", 'I hate corsages . They \'re for old ladies who wear mink stoles and musty dusting powder . That will not be me . Ever . The last thing I needed was a big , sloppy orchid planted over my double Ds . Why do you think I wear this minimizer harness ? But Amber just about had an ing-bing at the florist \'s -- you know , one of those fits like she used to pitch when she was two and she did n\'t approve of my day-care wardrobe selection . Ever try explaining to a two-year-old that the pink flowered pants are in the dirty clothes and she should be thankful she has something clean to wear , since Mommy has been featuring the same tired black skirt every other day for two weeks and scraping together enough           check for the used-car-dealer jingle Daddy wrote is still " in the mail " ? And that she needs to get her skinny behind dressed , since Mommy is ready to scream because she does n\'t want to be late for work again ? You ca n\'t . So somehow I \'d manage to tease , trick or threaten her into her clothes and I \'d wash out the pink pants that night by hand , which pretty much guaranteed the next day she wanted to wear her jeans with the stars embroidered on the back pockets . We sure came a long way from those days .', 'Anyway , in the fall after they had both graduated and found their first jobs , I was up early one Saturday , getting ready to go get my hair done , and the doorbell rang . Amber came flying downstairs , wearing the white blouse , tweed skirt and black leather Minnie Mouse pumps she \'d put on when she was trying to look sophisticated . I knew something was brewing , since it was only a little later than the time she usually got home from Friday night . Before I could say anything , she yanked open the door and J.J. strolled in wearing a navy blue suit . A suit ? On a Saturday morning ? It made me dizzy . J.J. kissed her , handed me a box of still-warm doughnuts and a bouquet of red and white carnations wrapped in that shiny green tissue paper . That \'s when my knees went to Jell-O and I almost missed the seat of my chair as I sat down . The two of them plopped on my sofa , all bright-eyed           I said , which I know is not what you \'re supposed to say when somebody gives you flowers and doughnuts , but it \'s all I could think of . The next thing I knew , he was down on one knee , holding a black velvet box . " Oh no , " is what came out of my mouth , which was n\'t exactly what I meant , but really , it was . I dropped the flowers all over the floor . J.J. swiped at a tear on his cheek after he slid the twinkling half-carat diamond on Amber \'s finger . " Look at it , Mama ! " Her hand was shaking when she showed it to me . Then she finally remembered to say , " Yes . " And I ate six doughnuts -- I do n\'t know what flavors -- then went to the hairdresser , because what else was there for me to do ?', '" Not as young as you and Daddy , " she informed me and snatched back her hand .', "Next thing I knew , I was up to my eyelids in bridal magazines and sample menus . I had no idea there were so many banquet halls and bridal shops within a fifty-mile radius of home . Or that there would be so many decisions to make -- calligraphied envelopes for the invitations or Mom 's lovely penmanship ? Edible , potable or savable favors ? Tall , see-through or short           Rehearsal dinner , breakfast the day after or both ? Or that it could possibly cost that much to get married . But it sure was fun , and it turned out just like Amber and I planned -- picture perfect . I mean , J.J. 's parents are lovely people , but their idea of decoration was crepe-paper streamers and balloons , and my daughter 's wedding was not going to be that kind of affair . Besides , his father had gotten transferred to Dallas a few years back , so it 's not like they could keep up with all the details . I acquired some shiny new platinum plastic , with a limit high enough to pay for a very nice car , in order to sponsor the occasion . It would be the only bill in my long history of bill paying that would make me smile every month when I wrote the check . Is n't that why I went to work every day ? So I could afford the nicer things in life ? Anyway , whatever it cost to make my baby           Except it made me remember how happy her father and I looked that Friday we ran off to city hall , all hope and expectation .", "But none of that mattered on Amber 's wedding day . It was the most perfect October day I ever hope to see . We had made it through corsets , crinolines , upsweeps and the first big crisis of the day when they sent the white stretch limo instead of the white superstretch SUV I paid for . Amber got on the phone , turned into the Bride of Frankenstein , and thirty minutes later we had the right car .", 'My best buds from the neighborhood -- Diane , Marie , Cecily and Joyce -- our kids had been in school together -- nodded their collective approval and congratulated me on throwing a stellar wedding . We called ourselves the " Live Five " and we toasted to my good taste . Twice .', "But would n't you know it ? After his serenade , Dear Old Dad presented the happy couple with a big fat check toward the down payment on a house -- guess he must 've sold a couple of songs -- finally . That brought the room to its feet . Terrific . OK . I guess it was n't like we hated each other . But it did n't take long after we parted ways for the reasons we got together in the first place to seem like they had been written in the sand . I guess we both loved each other once upon a time -- that was a whole ' nuther happily ever after . The only thing we still had in common was that we both loved Amber , so we agreed to be civilized about our daughter and not to bad-mouth each other in front of her , and after I made it clear that as far as I was concerned it was not then , nor would it ever be , OK for him to have put his dreams first           he gave up trying to convince me we could be friends . So the good thing about him singing was that I did n't have to dance with him , because I do n't know if I could have managed to glide across the floor , like when we used to do the Hustle --", "The maetre d ' kept my glass full . Frankly , he was supposed to . As much money as I laid out -- including the coconut shrimp and mini lamb chops during the cocktail hour , beef Wellington and sea bass for dinner and the Viennese table with the chocolate fountain -- he should have been at the door of my complimentary suite with           now we 're back to shoulda , and that woulda killed me for sure .", "Then he coughed . And my heart about exploded out of my chest because I did n't know he was there . Or who           brains banged against the inside of my skull , and as I caught sight of those high heels , my suit and new purple lace bra and panties in a heap on the floor , I came to the horrifying realization that my lumpy brown body was bare-butt naked . So I snatched the spongy beige blanket off the king-sized bed , uncovering a king-sized man , and I suddenly realized HE was J.J. 's cousin Ron , the best man .

The one who was like a second father to J.J. ? Second fathers are not supposed to have           cold day . At the ceremony he kissed my cheek before depositing me at my designated pew . I sat there , doing my best to look motherly and not think about how good he smelled and how good those lips felt on my cheek .", 'Could I say I loved Gerald ?', 'Amber and I had also reached a kind of understanding about me and Gerald . Back when she was thirteen , she came home early from a sleepover -- flew up the stairs , barged into my room to tell me all about the party and found him there . No , she did n\'t catch us doing anything , but it sure was n\'t what she expected from dear old Mom . After that , they \'d run into each other from time to time -- until the day Amber and I saw Gerald in the mall with his family . I tried to act like I did n\'t see him and dragged Amber into a sporting-goods store , praying she did n\'t see him either . But before I could even pretend I was seriously interested in the teepee of aluminum baseball bats , she was in my face . " Was n\'t that your friend ? Who was that with him ?           rather not have played . Especially since Amber was not buying my answers . Anyway , our discussion progressed into a screaming match in the car that I , not so proudly , ended with " because I \'m grown and as long as you live in my house and I pay your bills , what I say goes .

Then I got this flash that my hair must be smushed to the side of my head , so I kind of ran my fingers through it , casually , and wrapped the blanket around me like a super-sized tortilla .', 'I saw the tower of packages and had this vague memory of the bridal party cavalcade carrying them to the suite . Ron came last -- carrying a silver-wrapped box that felt like his and hers barbells . I think the others were gone . I hope the others were gone . I prayed the others were gone . I remembered looking at all those beautiful boxes and starting to cry , because the day had been overwhelming -- the whole week , really . Ron surrounded me in a hug and I remembered that it felt so good . And then I was standing in the middle of the floor , in my tortilla , crying again , which made it worse , because I do not cry . I \'d rather shoot staples under my fingernails than snivel and whine . But there I was , sniveling like a champ , and I could n\'t stop . " Please do n\'t tell anybody . " I was begging . " I \'m so embarrassed . " It was pathetic . I was pathetic . A spectacle           I could see myself .', 'That made me snort . " Oh , of course not , " I said . " The mother of the bride traditionally sleeps with the best man . "', '" We \'re all single adults here . " Ron folded me in his arms again . Those arms -- against that strong chest , which , I realized to my horror , now smelled more like my perfume than his aftershave . How much had I rubbed up against him ? Could n\'t the floor just open up and swallow me ? But I was n\'t getting off that easy . He kissed my eyelids and said , " Last night was great . And once you get to know me , you \'ll realize I would never disrespect you in any way .

The Hustle , the Electric Slide , the Booty Call -- ironic , huh ? I had n't grooved like that in years . My dad even took me for a turn around the           Ron , at least I remembered that part . Now , I would never have agreed to a slow dance , but it was one of those sneaky ones where the band starts off with some boogie music , then slides into a slow jam before you have a chance to make a graceful exit . Next thing I knew , I was cheek to cheek , smelling that good cologne . It did n't hurt that I caught my ex 's eye . That made me snuggle a little closer , and you can see where that got me . You know as well as I do there 's no fool like an old fool .", "I did n't even dry off . I snatched the terrycloth robe from behind the door , kicked the blanket out of my way and charged out of the bathroom . How in the world was I going to ask him if           Ron was gone . Damn . Just like he said he 'd be .", 'Then I was completely through . I called for a pot of coffee and started throwing clothes , lilac suit and all , in my bag because I had to go home .

Under any other circumstance , nothing could have brought her near this building where baleful apprehension hung heavy in the air like the stink of tallow , but the man who lived here , Richard Topcliffe , was her last hope . She had been to the court of law , and the justice merely shook his head dismissively and said that even had he believed her-and that , he said with a scowl , was as unlikely as apple blossom in November-there was nothing he could do for her . <br> The constable had been no more helpful .

She had knocked at the door once already , and it had been answered by a sturdy youth with a thin beard who looked her up and down with distaste and told her to go away . She refused and he closed the door in her face . The intense cold would have driven anyone else home to sit at the fireside wrapped in blankets , but Rose would not go until she had seen Topcliffe and begged him to help . <br> The bitter embers of sunlight dipped behind the edifices of St. Margaret \'s and the Abbey , and the cold grew deeper . Rose was fair , young , no more than seventeen with a face that , in other times , sparkled with smiles . She shivered uncontrollably in her heavy gowns and clutched the baby close to share what little warmth she had . Occasionally she lifted a large , well-formed breast from her garments to feed the infant ; the milk           almost as insistent as the child \'s hunger . Steam rose from her breast in the icy winter air . The child sucked at her with ferocity and she was thankful for it . Monstrous as she considered the baby , some instinct still made her keep it and feed it , even though it was not hers .

" Congratulations , Mr. Lee . You \'ve been served . " Copyright 2009 by Stephen Frey <br> Continues ... \n I <br> A Finer Place <br> Though the digital clock on the bedside table in his hotel room read 5:17 , Jack Griffin , suddenly wide awake , knew he would n\'t be able to get back to sleep . He \'d allowed himself to drift off too early the night before . On the heels of wakefulness came an unpleasant realization , that what he had n\'t wanted to admit yesterday , even to himself , was now all too clear in the solitary , predawn dark . He should have swallowed his petulance and waited the extra day for Joy . <br> It had been their long- established habit to flee the campus as soon as Griffin taught his last class . Usually , they hopped on the Freedom Trail ( his term for I- 95 ) , drove to New York and treated themselves by checking into a good hotel . During the day he would evaluate his small mountain of student portfolios while Joy shopped or otherwise amused herself , and then , evenings , they \'d catch up on movies and go to good restaurants . The whole thing reminded him of the early           small fortune , but there was something about spending money they did n\'t really have that made him optimistic about more coming in -- which was how it had worked in L.A. -- and it got him through the portfolios . <br> This year Kelsey \'s Cape Cod wedding had royally screwed up their plans , making New York impractical , though he \'d been willing to substitute Boston . But Joy , assuming that thanks to the wedding all the usual bets were off , had messed things up further by scheduling <br> meetings on the day after his last class . " Just go , " she said when he expressed his annoyance at the way things were working out . " Have a boys \' night out in Boston and I \'ll meet you on the Cape . " He \'d squinted at this proposal . Did n\'t you need more than one to have a boys \' night out ? Or had Joy meant it to be singular , one boy celebrating his boyness ? Was that how she \'d understood <br> the phrase all her           English language was not without glitches . She was forever mixing metaphors , claiming that something was " a tough line to hoe . " Row to hoe ? Line to walk ? Her sisters , Jane and June , were even worse , <br> and when corrected all three would narrow their eyes dangerously and identically . If they \'d had a family motto , it would have been You Know Perfectly Well What I Mean . <br> In any event his wife \'s suggestion that he go on without her had seemed less than sincere , which was why he decided to call her bluff . " All right , " he said , " that \'s what I \'ll do , " expecting her to say , Fine , if it means that much to you , I \'ll reschedule the meetings . But she had n\'t said that , even when she saw him packing his bag , and so he \'d discovered a truth that other men probably knew already -- that once you \'d packed a bag in front of a woman there was           taking the damn bag with you . <br> Worse , Joy , who preferred to watch movies on DVD rather than in a theater , as they were meant to be seen , had given him a list of films he was forbidden to see without her , and of course these were the only ones worth seeing . He \'d spent an hour looking through the restaurant guides provided by the hotel , but could n\'t decide on one , or even on what kind of food he wanted . Griffin had no trouble making these sorts of decisions when she was around , but for some reason , when he had only himself to please , he often could n\'t make up his mind . He told himself this was just the result of being married for thirty years , that part of the decision- making process was imagining what his wife would enjoy . Okay , but more and more he found himself stalled , in the middle of whatever room he happened to be standing in , and he realized that this had been , of           end Griffin had ordered room service and watched a crappy made- for- TV movie , the kind he and Tommy , his old partner , had been reduced to writing that last year or two in L.A. before he \'d gotten his teaching gig and moved back East with Joy and their daughter , Laura . He \'d fallen asleep before the first commercial , confident he could predict not only the movie \'s outcome but also half its dialogue . <br> In order not to dwell on yesterday \'s mistakes , he decided to put today in motion by calling down to the bell captain for his car . Twenty minutes later , dressed and showered , he \'d checked out of his Back Bay hotel . The whole of Boston fit neatly into the rectangle of his rearview mirror , and by the time the Sagamore Bridge , one of two that spanned the Cape Cod Canal , hove into view , the sky was silver in the east , and he felt the last remnants of yesterday \'s prevarications begin to lift like the patchy fog he           . The Sagamore arched dramatically upward in the middle , helping to pull the sun over the horizon , and though the air was far too cool , Griffin pulled off onto the shoulder of the road and put the convertible \'s top down , feeling truly off the reservation for the first time since leaving home in Connecticut . There was something vaguely thrilling about not being where his wife thought he was . She liked to know what people were up to , and not just him . She called Laura most mornings , her brain still lazy with sleep , to ask " So . . . what \'s on the agenda for you today ? " She also phoned both of her sisters several times a week and knew that June was having her hair done tomorrow morning and that Jane had put on five new pounds and was starting a diet . She even knew what new folly her idiot twin brothers , Jared and Jason , were engaged in . To Griffin , an only child , such behavior was well over the line           <br> Zipping along Route 6 , Griffin realized he was humming " That Old Black Magic , " the song his parents had sung ironically -- both university English professors , that \'s how they did most things -- every time they crossed the Sagamore , substituting Cape for black . When he was growing up , they \'d spent part of every summer on the Cape . He could always tell what kind of year it had been , moneywise , by when and where they stayed . One particularly prosperous year they \'d rented a small house in Chatham for the month of August . Another year , when faculty salaries were frozen , all they could afford was Sandwich in June . His parents had been less wed to each other than to a shared sense of grievance over being exiled eleven months of every year to the " Mid- fucking- west , " a phrase they did n\'t say so much as spit . They had good academic careers , though perhaps not the stellar ones that might have been predicted , given their Ivy League           of western New York State , his mother in suburban Rochester , his father in Buffalo , the children of lower- middle- class , white- collar parents . At Cornell , where they \'d both gone on scholarship , they \'d met not only each other but also the kind of friends who \'d invited them home for holidays in Wellesley and Westchester and for summer vacations in the Hamptons or on the Cape . They told their parents they could earn more money there , which was true , but in fact they \'d have done anything to avoid returning to their parents \' depressing upstate homes . At Yale , where they did their graduate work , they came to believe they were destined for research positions at one of the other Ivys , at least until the market for academics headed south and they had to take what they could get -- the pickings even slimmer for a couple -- and that turned out to be a huge state university in Indiana . <br> Betrayed . That was how they felt . Why go to Cornell ,           they \'d had little choice but to hunker down and make the best of their wretched timing , so they dove into teaching and research and committee work , hoping to bolster their vitae so that when the academic winds changed they \'d be ready . They feared the Princeton and Dartmouth ships had probably sailed for good , but that still left the Swarthmores and Vassars of the world as safe if not terribly exciting havens . This much , at least , was surely their due . And before going up for promotion and tenure ( or " promotion and tether , " in their parlance ) in the Midfucking-west , they \'d each had opportunities -- she at Amherst , he at Bowdoin -- but never together . So they stayed put in their jobs and their marriage , each terrified , Griffin now suspected , that the other , unshackled , would succeed and escape to the kind of academic post ( an endowed chair ! ) that would complete the misery of the one left behind . To make their unhappy circumstances more tolerable ,           these came to light . His father had been a genuine serial adulterer , whereas his mother simply refused to lag behind in this or anything else . <br> Of course all of this was adult understanding . As a boy , the reluctant witness to his parents \' myriad quarrels and recriminations , Griffin had imagined that he must be the one keeping them together . It was his mother who eventually disabused him of this bizarre notion . At his and Joy \'s wedding reception , actually . But by then they had finally divorced -- even spite , apparently , was not eternal -- and she \'d narrowly won the race to remarry . In an ecumenical mood , she ventured outside the English department for her second husband , a philosopher named Bart , whom she \'d quickly dubbed " Bartleby . " At the reception , half in her cups , she \'d assured Griffin , " Good heavens , no , it was n\'t you . What kept us together was \' That Old Cape Magic . \' Remember how we used to sing           turned to Bartleby . " One glorious month , each summer , " she explained . " Sun . Sand . Water . Gin . Followed by eleven months of misery . " Then back to Griffin . " But that \'s about par for most marriages , I think you \'ll find . " The I think you \'ll find , he understood , was of course meant to suggest that in her view , his own marital arithmetic was likely to be much the same . For a moment it seemed as if Bartleby might offer an observation of his own , but he apparently preferred not to , though he did sigh meaningfully . <br> Griffin was about to respond when his father reappeared with Claudia , his former graduate student and new wife . They \'d disappeared <br> briefly after the ceremony , to quarrel or make love , he had no idea . " I swear to God , " his mother said , " if he buys that child a house on the Cape -- and I do mean anywhere on the Cape --           brightened at a pleasant thought . " You might actually prove useful , " she told Bartleby , then turned back to Griffin . " Your stepfather collects locked- room murder mysteries . Death by curare , that sort of thing . You can figure something out , ca n\'t you ? Just make sure I \'m in full view of everyone in the drawing room when the fat cow hits the deck , writhing in excruciating pain . " She knew perfectly well , of course , that Griffin \'s father did n\'t have the money to buy Claudia ( who was more zaftig than fat ) or anyone else a house on the Cape , of course . She \'d made sure of that by beggaring him in the divorce settlement , but the possibility -- what of , that he might purchase a winning Lotto ticket ? -- still clearly worried her . <br> To Griffin , now fifty- five , roughly the same age his parents had been when he and Joy married , the Cape place- names were still <br> magical : Falmouth , Woods           They made a boy of him again and put him in the backseat of <br> his parents \' car , where he \'d spent much of his boyhood , unbelted , resting his arms on the front seat , trying to hear what they , who never made any attempt to include him in their conversations , were talking about . It was n\'t so much that he was interested in their front- seat conversations as aware that decisions that impacted him were being made up there , and if privy to these hatching plans he might offer an opinion . Unfortunately , the fact that his chin was resting on the seat back seemed to preclude this . Most of what he overheard was n\'t really worth the effort anyway . " Wellfleet , " his mother might say , studying the road atlas . " Why have n\'t we ever tried Wellfleet ? " By the time Griffin was a high school freshman , which marked the last of their Cape vacations , they \'d rented just about everywhere . Each summer , when they handed over the           agent always asked if they wanted to book it for next year , but they always said no , which made Griffin wonder if the perfect spot they were searching for really existed . Perhaps , he concluded , just looking was sufficient in and of itself . <br> While he roamed the beach unattended , full of youthful energy and freedom , his parents spent sunny afternoons lying on the sand with their " guilty pleasures , " books they \'d have been embarrassed to admit to their colleagues they \'d ever heard of . They were on vacation , they claimed , not just from the Mid- fucking- west but also from the literary canon they \'d sworn to uphold . His mother \'s taste ran to dark , disturbing thrillers and cynical spy novels . " That , " she would say , turning the book \'s last page with evident satisfaction , " was truly twisted . " His father alternated between literary pornography and P. G. Wodehouse , enjoying both thoroughly , as if Naked Lunch and Bertie Wooster Sees It Through were intended as           -- indeed , studied as intently as each year \'s Modern Language Association job listings -- was the real- estate guide . Unwilling to give the other a first look , they always picked up two copies as soon as they arrived and wrote their names on the covers so they \'d know which was which and whose fault it was if one got lost . A house here was part of their longrange , two- part plan to escape the Mid- fucking- west . First they would find real jobs back East , where they \'d locate a suitable apartment to rent . This would allow them to save money for a house on the Cape , where they \'d spend summers and holidays and the occasional long weekend , until of course they retired -- early if they could swing it -- and lived on there full- time , reading and writing op- eds and , who knew , maybe even trying their hand at a novel . <br> A single day was usually all it took for each of them to plow through the hundreds of listings           one of two categories -- Ca n\'t Afford It or Would n\'t Have It As a Gift -- before tossing the booklet aside in disgust , because everything was more expensive this year than last . But the very next day his father would set Jeeves aside and take another look . " Page twenty- seven , " he \'d say , and Griffin \'s mother would set down her Ripley and rummage for her copy in the beach bag . " Bear with me , now , " he \'d continue . Or , " Some things would have to go right " -- meaning a big merit raise or a new university- press book contract -- " but . . . " And then he \'d explain why a couple of the listings they \'d quickly dismissed the day before just maybe could be made to work . Later in the month , on a rainy day , they \'d go so far as to look at a house or two at the low end of the Ca n\'t Afford It category , but the realtors always intuited           kickers . The house they wanted was located in a future only they could see . For people who dealt largely in dreams , his father was fond of observing , realtors were a surprisingly unromantic bunch , like card counters in a Vegas casino . <br> The drive back to the Mid- fucking- west was always brutal , his parents barely speaking to each other , as if suddenly recalling last year \'s infidelities , or maybe contemplating whom they \'d settle for this year . Sex , if you went by Griffin \'s parents , definitely took a <br> backseat to real estate on the passion gauge . <br> From the Hardcover edition . <br> Continues ... \n I vow the new earl will drive me to distraction , thinking to marry us off like so much breeding stock . -- Letter from Miss Arabella Loring to Fanny Irwin <br> London , May 1817 <br> Matrimony . The very word was menacing . Yet the new Earl of Danvers could ignore the topic no longer , much to his regret . <br> " A pity the late earl already met his end , " Lord Danvers professed , punctuating his declaration with the slash of a steel rapier . " Otherwise I would have his heart on a spit for the trick he served me , leaving me to play procurer for three wards I never wanted . " His complaint , voiced amid the sounds of swordplay , was met with both sympathetic laughter and skepticism from his friends . <br> " Procurer , Marcus ? Is n\'t that something of an exaggeration ? " <br> " It perfectly describes my responsibility . " <br> " Matchmaker is a more tasteful characterization . " <br> Matchmaker . What a lowering thought . <br> Marcus Pierce , formerly addressed as Baron Pierce and now the eighth Lord           relished a challenge , he would gladly have forgone being saddled with three penniless beauties -- and worse , the burden of finding them respectable husbands . <br> Yet he \'d inherited the Loring sisters along with his new title , so he was resigned to discharging his duty sooner or later . <br> Preferably later . <br> Marcus had enjoyed thirty-two pleasurable years of bachelorhood , the last ten as one of England \'s most eligible and elusive marital catches . Since matrimony ranked high on his list of least-favorite subjects , he had put off facing his obligation to his unwanted wards for weeks now . <br> This fine spring morning , however , he \'d finally forced himself to broach the issue while he was engaged in fencing practice at his Mayfair mansion with his two closest friends and fellow escapees of the Marriage Mart . <br> " But you do see my dilemma ? " Marcus asked , executing a swift parry against his equally skilled opponent , Andrew Moncrief , Duke of Arden . <br> " Ah , yes , " Drew answered above the           off your three wards , but you expect to find few takers , given the scandal in their family . " <br> " Precisely . " Marcus flashed an engaging grin . " I do n\'t suppose you would volunteer to offer for one of them ? " <br> The duke shot him an eloquent glance as he leapt back to evade a deft thrust . " As much as I yearn to help you , old sport , I cherish my liberty too much to make such a devastating sacrifice , even for you . " <br> " Stubble it , Marcus . " The amused drawl came from the sidelines of the salon that Marcus used as a fencing hall . Heath Griffin , Marquess of Claybourne , lounged on a settee as he awaited his turn at practice , drawing idle patterns in the air with his foil . " You \'re touched in the head if you think to persuade us to offer for your wards . " <br> " They are reputed to be great beauties , " Marcus coaxed . <br> Heath laughed outright           How old is the eldest Miss Loring ? Four and twenty ? " <br> " Not quite that . " <br> " But she is said to be a spitfire . " <br> " So I \'m told , " Marcus reluctantly acknowledged . His solicitors had described Arabella Loring as charming but fiercely stubborn-minded in her desire for emancipation from his guardianship . <br> " You have n\'t met her yet ? " Heath asked . <br> " No , I \'ve managed to avoid her thus far . The Misses Loring were away from home when I called to pay my condolences on the death of their step-uncle three months ago . And since then , I \'ve let my solicitors handle all succeeding correspondence . But I will have to deal with them eventually . " He sighed . " I will likely travel to Chiswick next week . " <br> The Danvers estate was in the countryside near the small village of Chiswick , some half dozen miles west of London \'s fashionable Mayfair district , where many of the wealthy aristocracy resided . The distance           Marcus was under no illusions that his task could be dispatched quickly . <br> " From everything I hear , " Drew said as he steadily advanced , " your wards will indeed prove a handful . It wo n\'t be easy to marry them off , particularly the eldest . " Nodding , Marcus gave a wry grimace . " Certainly not when they profess to be so adamantly opposed to marriage . I \'ve offered to provide them significant dowries to induce respectable suitors to wed them , but they rejected my proposition out of hand . " <br> " Harbor bluestocking notions of independence , do they ? " <br> " So it would seem . A pity I ca n\'t convince either of you to come to my rescue . " <br> It would have been a neat solution to his dilemma , Marcus reflected as he fought off Drew \'s determined offensive . In addition to inheriting the title of earl to add to his long-held barony , he \'d been encumbered with the entailed and impoverished Danvers estate , as well as responsibility for           were blessed with impeccable lineage , superb breeding , and enviable beauty , but all were unmarried and getting somewhat long in the tooth . <br> Their single state was due less to their lack of fortune than to the horrendous scandal in their family . Four years ago , their mother had run off to the Continent with her French lover . Then barely a fortnight later , their father had been killed in a duel over his latest mistress -- which had put an abrupt end to any last gasp chances the daughters had of marrying well . <br> Resolving to give his unwanted wards into more willing hands , Marcus had thought to marry them off by providing them with immense dowries . But that was before he \'d discovered how fiercely independent the three beauties were . The eldest sister \'s letters had become downright impassioned in her appeals for self-rule . <br> " They are legally my wards until they turn twentyfive , " Marcus explained , " but the eldest , Arabella , is already fretting over the constraints . In the past month           and her sisters have no need of a guardian at their advanced ages . Regrettably for us all , I am bound by the terms of the will . " <br> Pausing to circle his opponent , Marcus ran a hand roughly through his raven hair . " Truthfully , " he muttered , " it would have suited me better had I never heard of the Loring sisters . I never wished for the additional title . I was perfectly content as a baron . " <br> His friends offered him sympathetic but amused looks , which prompted Marcus to add pointedly , " I expect your help in solving my dilemma , you spineless reprobates . Surely you can think of some appropriate candidates I can throw their way . " <br> " You could always offer for one of them yourself , " Heath suggested , a wicked gleam in his eye . <br> " God forbid . " Marcus paused to shudder and was nearly skewered when Drew lunged with his foil . Through much of their boyhood and all of their adulthood , the three           had been inseparable , having attended Eton and Oxford together and then come into their vast fortunes and illustrious titles the same year . And after being chased relentlessly by marriage-minded debutantes and barely eluding the traps of countless matchmaking mamas , all three shared grave reservations about the institution of matrimony . Most particularly the sort of cold , convenient union typical of the aristocracy . Marcus had never encountered even one woman he might want to take for his wife . The thought of being shackled for life to a female he scarcely liked , much less loved , sent chills down his spine . Yet he owed it to his titles , both the new and the old , to carry on his bloodlines , so eventually he would have to marry . <br> The demise of his bachelorhood , however , would be a long time in coming , Marcus vowed . <br> Realizing his concentration had been shattered by all this unpalatable talk of matrimony , he stepped back and offered Drew a sardonic salute . " I had best withdraw before you slice me           your turn at practice . " <br> When the marquess replaced him on the floor , Marcus crossed the salon to a side table , where he set down his rapier and retrieved a towel to wipe his damp brow . The clash of steel had just resumed when he heard a commotion out in the corridor , coming from the vicinity of his entrance hall . He could only make out every third word or so , but it was clear he had a female caller . . . and that his butler was denying his presence . <br> His curiosity piqued , Marcus moved closer to the salon door , the better to hear . <br> " I repeat , Lord Danvers is not at home , miss . " <br> " Not at home or not receiving callers ? " the female voice asked pleasantly . " I have come a long distance in order to speak with him . I am willing to search the premises if I must . " Her voice was low and melodious but definitely determined . " Where may I find           Apparently Hobbs was attempting to prevent her from entering the house but losing the battle . A moment later his august servant actually yelped . " Madam , you can not go abovestairs ! " <br> Picturing the butler blocking the foot of the mansion \'s sweeping staircase , Marcus found himself stifling a grin . <br> " Why not ? " she queried . " Will I find his lordship abed or in a state of undress ? " <br> Hobbs let out a shocked exclamation before muttering , " Very well , if you insist . I will inquire if his lordship is receiving . " <br> " Pray , do n\'t trouble yourself . Just tell me where he is , and I will announce myself . " The dulcet voice paused . " Never mind . I hear swordplay , so I expect I need only follow the sounds . " <br> Marcus braced himself as light footsteps approached along the corridor . <br> The woman who appeared in the doorway a moment later was striking in her loveliness . Although her tall , elegant figure           she possessed an unmistakable confidence , a graceful presence , that compelled attention . <br> A beauty of substance , Marcus realized at once , captivated by the sight . <br> Despite her unusual height and slenderness , she was curvaceous enough to entice even a man of his jaded experience . Her pale red-gold hair was swept up beneath a bonnet , with curling tendrils spilling around her finely-boned face . He was mainly aware , however , of the pair of keen gray eyes surveying the room , the most intriguing he had ever seen . They were the hue of silver smoke and held an intelligence and warmth that instantly stirred his senses . <br> Her jaw was set with determination , yet when she spied him , she suddenly faltered . A slight blush rose to her cheeks , as if she realized the impropriety of barging in on three noblemen engaged in a fencing match , all dressed in shirtsleeves and breeches and boots , with no cravats or waistcoats or coats . <br> Her eyes traveled from Marcus \'s bare throat to his linen           Then abruptly , she jerked her gaze back up to his face , as if knowing she \'d been caught in a forbidden scrutiny . When he locked glances with her , the color mounted in her cheeks . <br> Marcus found himself enchanted . <br> An instant later she appeared to gather her wits and forged ahead with her mission . " Which of you gentlemen is Lord Danvers ? " she asked sweetly . <br> He took a polite step toward her . " At your service , Miss . . . ? " <br> A vexed Hobbs answered behind her , " Miss Arabella Loring to see you , my lord . " <br> " I take it you are my eldest ward , " Marcus observed , concealing his amusement . <br> Her lovely mouth tightened the slightest measure , but then she tendered him a charming smile . " Regrettably , yes , I am your ward . " <br> " Hobbs , take Miss Loring \'s pelisse and bonnet -- " <br> " Thank you , my lord , but I do n\'t intend           . . . in private , if I may . " By now his two friends had paused in their fencing match and were watching his unexpected visitor with avid curiosity . When she advanced into the room , Marcus saw Drew raise a quizzical eyebrow , expressing surprise at her stunning appearance . <br> Marcus was highly surprised himself . Based on his solicitor \'s comments , he had expected his eldest ward to be something of a shrew , but the reports of her beauty did n\'t do her justice . She was , to put it simply , magnificent . <br> He gave Drew and Heath an apologetic glance . " Would you excuse us ? " <br> Both noblemen crossed the salon with their rapiers , and Heath flashed Marcus a slow grin as he passed , along with one of his habitually baiting remarks . " We will await you in the hall should you need defending . " He saw Arabella stiffen at the quip , but then she laughed , a low melodious sound that once more fired his senses . " I           pity , was Marcus \'s first thought ; he might have appreciated seeing what she could do to his body . When they were alone , however , Marcus fixed his ward with a level gaze . He admired her boldness in coming here but knew he should make some show of disapproval if he intended to keep the upper hand with her . " My solicitors warned me about your determination , Miss Loring , but I did n\'t expect you to flout propriety by visiting me at my home . " <br> She gave a shrug of her elegant shoulders . " You left me little choice , my lord , since you refused to reply to my letters . We have an important matter to discuss . " " I agree , we need to settle the issue of your and your sisters \' futures . " <br> Her hesitation was followed by another proffered smile . " I am certain you are a man of reason , Lord Danvers . . . " <br> Marcus \'s eyebrow shot up at her obvious attempt to charm him           fingers , and he felt the effect down to his loins -- an effect he instinctively resisted . <br> " Oh , I am quite reasonable ordinarily . " <br> " Then you will understand our reluctance to acknowledge you as our guardian . I know you mean well , but we do n\'t require your assistance . " <br> " Certainly I mean well , " he said affably . " You and your sisters are now my responsibility . " <br> A flash of impatience showed in her gray eyes . " Which is patently absurd . We are all past the usual legal age of dependency . Most guardianships end at twenty-one . And we have no fortune to supervise , so there can be no financial justification for your management . " <br> " No , " Marcus concurred . " Your step-uncle left you without a penny to your names . " <br> Taking a deep breath , she made an obvious effort at civility . " We do n\'t desire your charity , my lord . " <br> " It is not charity ,           are three vulnerable females in need of a man \'s protection . " <br> " We do not need protecting , " she replied emphatically . " No ? " Marcus gave her a penetrating look . " My solicitors are of the opinion that someone ought to take you and your sisters in hand . " <br> Her eyes kindled . " Is that so ? Well , I hardly think you are qualified to \' take us in hand , \' as you term it . You have no experience playing guardian . " <br> Marcus was pleased to be able to refute her statement . " On the contrary , I have a good deal of experience . I \'ve been my sister \'s guardian for the past ten years . She is twenty-one now , the same age as your youngest sister , Lilian -- who is an unruly hoyden , I \'m told . " <br> That made Arabella pause . " Perhaps that \'s true , but Lily was at an impressionable age when our mother deserted us . " <br> " What of           beauty has made her the target for any number of rakes and scoundrels . I suspect she could benefit from a guardian \'s protection . " <br> " Roslyn can take care of herself . We all can . We have since we were very young . " <br> " But what sort of future can you expect ? " Marcus countered . " Your chances for good marriages were ruined when your parents chose to create their last blatant scandal . " <br> He saw the pain that claimed Arabella \'s features for a fleeting moment before she forced another smile . " How well I know , " she murmured . " But even so , it is not your affair . " <br> Marcus shook his head . " I understand why you resent me , Miss Loring , a perfect stranger taking control of your home -- " <br> " I do n\'t begrudge you the title or estate . What I do resent is your callous assumption that we wish to marry . " That made him smile . " It is hardly callous to           for young ladies of quality is marriage . You act as if I \'ve gravely offended you . " <br> By now Arabella was clearly biting her tongue . " Forgive me if I gave you that impression , my lord . I know you do n\'t mean it as an insult -- " <br> " You can not be foolish enough to turn down five thousand pounds each . " <br> " Actually I can -- " Suddenly she broke off and gave a rueful laugh . The husky , sultry sound raked his nerve endings with pleasure . " No , I wo n\'t allow you to provoke me , my lord . I came here this morning determined to be pleasant . " <br> Marcus found himself staring at her ripe , tempting mouth before he shook himself . Arabella was speaking again , he realized . <br> " Perhaps you see our decision as inexplicable , Lord Danvers , but my sisters and I do not choose to marry . " <br> " Why not ? " When she failed to answer , Marcus hazarded a           the example your parents set . " <br> " It does , " Arabella admitted grudgingly . " Our parents were determined to make each other \'s lives miserable and fought at every opportunity . After the acrimony we witnessed growing up , is it any wonder we have an aversion to arranged marriages ? " <br> Marcus felt more than a measure of sympathy . " I \'m familiar with the sentiment . My own parents were scarcely any more congenial . " <br> At his softer tone , she searched his face for a long moment . But then she dragged her gaze away to focus on a pool of sunlight streaming through the nearest window . " In any case , we have no need to marry . We have sufficient incomes now to support ourselves . " <br> " Incomes ? " <br> " If you had troubled yourself to read my letters , you would know about our academy . " <br> " I did read your letters . " <br> She glanced pointedly at him . " But you were not courteous enough to           me . " <br> " Guilty as charged . But to my credit , I intended to call upon you next week . " <br> When he smiled winningly , Arabella drew a sharp breath . After a moment , she took another tack . " Come now , Lord Danvers . You do n\'t want responsibility for us , admit it . " <br> Marcus could n\'t bring himself to lie . " Very well , it \'s true , I do n\'t want it . " <br> " Then why do n\'t you simply forget about us ? " <br> " I doubt anyone who has ever met you , " Marcus said dryly , " could simply forget you , Miss Loring . " When she gave him a piercing look , he sighed . " You are my responsibility now , whether either of us likes it , and I wo n\'t abandon my duty to see to your welfare . You \'ll find I \'m not such an ogre . And I \'m wealthy enough to fund your dowries . " <br> That made her           n\'t accept your charity . Our academy allows us adequate financial independence . " <br> Admittedly , learning of her academy had roused Marcus \'s curiosity . " I understand this academy of yours is a finishing school ? " <br> " Of a sort . We teach comportment and manners and correct speech to wealthy young women who were not born to the Quality . " <br> " The daughters of the working class , in other words . How very unique you are , Miss Loring . " <br> Her gaze narrowed . " You are making sport of me . " <br> " Perhaps . " Actually he was n\'t . He truly thought it admirable that Arabella and her sisters had found an occupation to support themselves , unlike almost every other lady of their station , who would n\'t be caught dead employed in menial labor . But he could n\'t help wanting to provoke her , if only for the pleasure of seeing those beautiful gray eyes kindle again . <br> " And your sisters teach there as well ? " Marcus asked leadingly           who are friends of mine . Our patroness is Lady Freemantle . It was at her request that we opened the school three years ago . Are you acquainted with her ? Her late husband was a baronet , Sir Rupert Freemantle . " <br> Marcus nodded . " I know her . But I \'m not certain it is fitting for my wards to be employed at a school , no matter how refined . You realize that as your guardian , I will have to approve your participation ? " <br> Arabella eyed him warily . " I assure you , it is a perfectly respectable endeavor . " <br> " Some would call your opinions bluestocking nonsense . " It was very bad of him to goad her like that , but the pleasure of seeing her spirited reaction was too great to resist . <br> She seemed , however , to recognize his purpose . " You wo n\'t provoke me into losing my temper , my lord . " <br> " No ? " <br> When he took a step closer , she froze ,           . But then she straightened her spine and stood her ground , her gaze direct and challenging . Marcus had the sudden savage urge to sweep her up in his arms and carry her to the nearest bed . <br> He \'d never had such a primal reaction to a woman before -- bloody inappropriate , considering that she was his ward . <br> Arabella drew a slower breath , clearly striving for equanimity , as he was . " I do n\'t believe your mental acumen is impaired , my lord . Why is it so difficult for you to accept that we do n\'t wish to be under your thumb ? That we do n\'t want your financial assistance ? You are under no obligation to support us . " <br> " The will says differently . " <br> " Then I will hire my own solicitors to contest the will . " <br> " How can you afford it ? You do n\'t have the wherewithal to contest my guardianship in court . " <br> " Our patroness will help us . Lady Freemantle does not believe           has promised us her support . She is not as wealthy as you , of course , but her father left her a fortune from his manufacturing and mining enterprises . " <br> " It should prove an interesting contest , " Marcus said amiably , crossing his arms over his chest . His languid smile finally succeeded in igniting her temper . " You can not force us to accept your settlements ! " <br> " No , I suppose not . But once the size of your dowries becomes known , you will have suitors throwing themselves at your feet and hounding my door to offer for you . " <br> Her gloved fists clenched as she advanced toward him , her eyes flashing dangerously . " You wo n\'t succeed in selling us , your lordship ! It is outrageous that grown women are treated as mere property , no better than livestock . We are not broodmares to be hawked to the highest bidder ! " <br> Judging by her impassioned speech , he had struck a nerve . There was fire in her eyes --           <br> " It seems true after all , " he murmured , totally intrigued by the way Arabella was glaring daggers at him . <br> " What is true ? " <br> " That eyes can actually give off sparks . Yours are bright as fireworks . " <br> It was that provocative remark that drove her temper over the edge . The growling sound she made deep in her throat was that of a taunted lioness -- a low , dangerous rumble . " I have tried my utmost to remain patient , " she began . Marching past him to the table , Arabella swept up his rapier and returned to face him , bringing the tip directly against his chest . <br> " I was determined to use reason to convince you , and if that failed , I hoped to prevail on your better nature . Evidently you do n\'t have one ! " <br> Utterly fascinated now , Marcus raised his hands slowly in surrender . " I make it a point never to argue with an armed female . " <br> " Good !           ridiculous notion of marrying us off . " " I fear I ca n\'t make any such promise under duress , sweeting . " <br> " You can and you will ! " <br> " No . " Despite his fascination , he was not about to be threatened into doing anyone \'s bidding . But then his gaze fixed on Arabella \'s face . . . the smooth ivory texture of her skin , her ripe mouth . . . . He was struck with the fiercest urge to kiss her , which was astonishing , since he was not ordinarily a rash man . " Go ahead , do your worst , love . " <br> Clenching her teeth , radiating frustration , she raised the point of the foil to the vulnerable hollow of his throat , but there she stopped . <br> It was a stand-off , one Marcus was not prepared to endure much longer . When she continued to hesitate , his fingers closed around her gloved ones and slowly , inexorably pushed the tip away from his throat . Although the immediate danger           shackling her wrist as he stepped closer . His gaze dropped again to the tempting line of her lips . <br> Her beautiful face was turned up to his , and when she nervously moistened her lips , he fought the fierce desire to capture them with his own . <br> Despite the warning voice shouting in his head , Marcus found himself drawing Arabella even nearer , pulling her against him , until their bodies brushed . The feeling that sparked between them when he felt the sweet press of her breasts was hot enough to singe him . <br> Her eyes flared then with a different emotion , while his senses avidly relayed the excitement of touching her . <br> She felt warm and intensely vital . Intensely alive . Her feminine softness raised every primal male instinct he possessed . <br> It was all he could do to keep control of himself . " The next time you threaten a man , Miss Loring , " he advised in a voice that was suddenly husky , " make certain you are prepared to carry it through .           snatched her hand from his grasp and stepped back . " I will take note next time , your lordship . " <br> Marcus was startled by how badly he wanted there to be a next time . He watched as Arabella tossed down the rapier , where it clattered on the floor . <br> " You should be glad I am too much of a lady to run you through , " she declared . With that she spun on her heel and stalked to the door . But then she paused to shoot a darkling glance over her shoulder . " If you want a battle , Lord Danvers , I promise I will give you one . " <br> Continues ... \n ALBION MERKEL MAY HAVE been a bit mad , but that was par for the course in the small Delta city of Bonaparte , Mississippi , whither ( as they say in old novels ) he had removed ( as they also say in old novels ) after Hurricane Katrina erased his ancestral diggings in Biloxi . He purchased a moderately historic cottage called Smith \'s Haven in Bonaparte \'s Olde Towne , near the kudzu-draped bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River and there installed himself , his dog Miss Scarlett ( named for American fiction \'s most famous bitch ) and a load of watermarked furnishings rescued from the wrack and ruin on the coast . Behind his new-old dwelling \'s lichened brick walls , shielded from the street by azalea hedges and half a dozen red and white crape myrtles , he filled his days with gardening , with business - which consisted almost wholly in suing his former insurance company - and with his lifelong hobby , psychical research . In that department , everything looked hopeful . Bonaparte was richly supplied with ghosts . Spirits clumped about invisibly on wooden galleries , or whistled " Lorena           doors had once stood , or wept for lost lovers on moonlit nights , or frightened fornicators in the Confederate cemetery . Unfortunately , they avoided Albion \'s cottage altogether . Even Miss Scarlett , who far surpassed him in the ESP department , after carefully examining the house did not find a single blank wall to growl and bristle at . On the other hand , for the first time in her pampered life , she chose to lie outdoors all day , making her nest under an azalea bush in the patio close by the garden gate , where she slept from dawn to dusk , rousing herself only to gulp meals and bark at the sixteen or seventeen vehicles that constituted Bonaparte \'s rush hour . To Albion this seemed significant . Something made his new home unattractive to dogs and spirits . But what ? He made the mistake of asking his housekeeper , an up-to-date black woman who \'d returned to her Mississippi roots after thirty years in California in order ( she said ) to escape the traffic . There was already a certain           only cleaning lady he \'d ever had who addressed him as " Baby , " a term that seemed to put their relationship on an uncomfortably physical basis . ( Placenta ? Baby ? ) Her attitude about spirits was equally disconcerting . Briefly removing from her lower lip the cigarette that usually hung there as if sutured , Placenta knocked some ash onto Albion \'s mother \'s gate-leg table , brushed it from the tabletop onto a saltwater-stained Persian carpet that could n\'t get much more damaged anyway , and stated flatly that her son Antwon did n\'t believe in spirits . " And what does he know about it ? " snapped Albion . " Well , he teaches computer science at Mat her , " she said , naming a small but extremely upscale private college in New England , as if that settled the matter . Then she bustled away about her duties , wiggling the round bottom that decorated her minimal frame like an olive on a toothpick . " Utter irrelevancy , " Albion muttered . What did computers have to do with spirits           acquaintances in Bonaparte , he recognized that Placenta stood superior to most members of the cleaning-lady profession - he just wished she would n\'t keep reminding him of it . He put the problem of his ghostless condition to a new acquaintance , Mrs. DeFlores , one afternoon when they were having tea in the back parlor of her mansion , Cottonwood . An eighty-two-year-old widow who \'d married into the town \'s feudal aristocracy , she yielded to none in her attachment to the old ways , and often seemed to converse in the language of 1900 , if not earlier . Thus she told Albion that he needed to consult a " darky " she knew , who was a medium . This was the first time in half a century that Albion had heard anybody say darky without winking , and he found it particularly remarkable since he knew that Mrs. DeFlores had been born Mabel O\'Dowd in Philadelphia , PA . Sipping his Earl Grey , he reflected briefly on the rumors that swirled around the lady - one , almost certainly false , that she           true , that Cottonwood possessed ( or rather was possessed by ) a veritable costume ball of ghosts . According to Albion \'s barber , they had names like Captain Jack and Mister Dick and Darlin \' Sissy , and there was even a famous hunting dog of a few generations back called Powderhorn , who could be heard baying on moonlit nights . If that was true , Mrs. DeFlores \'s recommendation of a medium might be worth following up . Albion had just opened his mouth to tell her so , when something began thumping violently inside the wall behind her chair . She murmured a word of apology , set her cup down , picked up a walking stick leaning against the wall and banged away vigorously , at the same time shouting , " Now captain , you stop that ! It \'s safe-I \'ve told you a million times , it \'s safe ! " The noise inside the wall stopped . She returned the stick to its place , and asked Albion if he \'d care for a sugar cookie . " I \'d           her . His voice trembled a little , not with fear but with the joy of a lepidopterist who spots a new kind of butterfly . " Oh , just old Captain Jack . You know in 1863 ? When General Grant came through Bonaparte on his way to burn Jackson ? Well , the captain was away with the Confederate army , so Darlin \' Sissy , who was his wife and a lot smarter than anybody else in the family , including him , broke through the plaster and hid the family silver inside the wall . Then she had her Negrahs turn the room into a bedroom and set up the bed so the headboard concealed the opening . When the Yanks arrived , she invited General Grant to spend the night , and he slept in that very bed , keeping the silver safer than anybody else could have ! " Then Captain Jack was captured at the Battle of Furnace Creek , after getting wounded in a place we wo n\'t discuss . Out of gratitude for Sissy \'s hospitality , General Grant paroled him           that same bed and nursed him until he died of complications . To comfort his male ego , she told him he was guarding the silver just by lying there . Unfortunately , after he died he kept on trying to guard it , even when the war was over and Darlin \' Sissy had taken it out again . " She was a great hostess , Mr. Merkel , especially after her post-war marriage to Mr. Dick , her brother-in-law who \'d joined the Republicans and made lots of money , bless his heart . She needed all the silverware she could lay her hands on for her famous sit-down dinners for eighteen or twenty-four . Captain Jack to this day remains a man of few ideas but very tenacious , and raises a fuss whenever he happens to notice for the umpteenth time that the silver \'s gone . It \'s really hard dealing with such a stupid man , and I must say that death has not improved him . " Albion was enthralled . " This darky , " he said , " the one who           n\'t haunted - would you give me her name ? " " Her name , " said Mrs. D. , " is Cyrene Foxx . " ( She pronounced it Syreeny . ) " I \'ll give you her cell phone number before you leave . She is one of the old sort , Mr. Merkel , and you might consider employing her in place of Placenta , a fine and intelligent woman who is , unfortunately , very modern . " Albion nodded . He felt fairly sure that one of the old sort would not call him Baby . His hostess concluded the tea party with some words of warning . " Cyrene worked for me a few years back , and she was an excellent housekeeper and made the most marvelous spoonbread . Yet I had to let her go . She \'s a physical medium , you see , and the way things flew around was quite distracting . Also , without meaning to do so , she stirred up the ghosts and made it hard to get a good night \'s rest , what with           or not , and the captain hammering on the wall , and Mr. Dick calling for someone to muddle his toddy , and Darlin \' Sissy ( usually the most thoughtful of women ) playing " Aura Lee " over and over and over on a piano I sold years ago because it was full of sour notes . " I \'m warning you about this , Mr. Merkel , so you wo n\'t complain if things get a little strange down in Smith \'s Haven . Cyrene is a true Christian and in Heaven will undoubtedly be a lot whiter than either one of us , but should you decide to employ her , you deserve to be told that having her around is not all gravy by any means . " INTERVIEWING CYRENE and ridding himself of Placenta took Albion less than a week . Placenta departed in anger after telling him , " What you want to work for you , Baby , is a nigger . " She lifted her upper lip and almost snarled the forbidden word . Which was n\'t true at all .           he now realized - was a darky , specifically one attuned to the spirit world . Cyrene certainly qualified for the dark part . Her skin had the almost ebonized finish so rare nowadays among African Americans , most of whom tend toward beige or latte . She was a small , leathery woman who dressed in surprisingly up-to-date pantsuits and went about her work with vigor . When she was ready to leave , Albion asked if she had detected any spiritual presences in Smith \'s Haven . " No , Mr. Alby , I did n\'t . There is a force here , however . " " What sort of force ? " " I do n\'t know , not yit , anyways . But it centers in the liberty . " " What library ? " he asked , never having noticed one . " Up there , " she said , pointing at the living room ceiling . " I can just feel the weight of all them dusty old books , pushing down . Well , here \'s my daughter to ride me home ,           to the curb . " See you next Tuesday . " Albion knew that a respectable attic topped his house , for the A/C man had climbed up there to " check out them ducks and fillers . " Aside from the existence of ducts and filters , however , the owner of the house knew nothing about what lay beyond the trapdoor in the hall ceiling . Now , with some effort and the aid of a hooked pole , he pulled down a folding staircase and ascended slowly and cautiously until he reached the dusty planking of the attic floor . A good seven feet high in the center , the space would have been easy to traverse except for a clutter of retired furniture and the ducts , which coiled this way and that like foil-wrapped anacondas from their origin in a large metal box . A louvered ventilator at the back of the house admitted a brownish twilight . Cautiously , Albion stepped over various sections of the anaconda until he spotted , tucked into the shadows beside the cobwebby brick chimney , an old armoire           To the accompaniment of falsetto complaints from the lock and hinges , he swung open the door and found inside four shelves of , yes , dusty old books . He used his handkerchief to clean the seat and arms of a battered armchair that stood conveniently close , then sat down and began pulling the books one by one off the shelves . They were in every sense weighty stuff - old medical standards like Gray \'s Anatomy plus many works of skeptical and/or materialistic philosophers . Democritus , Hume , Voltaire , Marx , Spencer , Huxley , Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , Santayana - all were here . Besides the big guns of disbelief , Albion found books by lesser known figures - La Mettrie \'s Man a Machine , d\'Holbach \'s System of Nature , Diderot \'s Essays . Flipping through the latter , he discovered that someone had heavily underlined the Frenchman \'s brutal view that " mankind will never be free until the last king has been strangled with the entrails of the last priest . " In the margin the same somebody had penciled           thought Albion , his heart sinking . No wonder ghosts shied away from Smith \'s Haven . Albion had bought and settled down in a house once occupied by an ardent and committed skeptic , and everybody knew how the delicate structure of ectoplasm shrivels before disbelief like a flower in a frost . But who could the malignant unbeliever have been ? On their next meeting , Mrs. DeFlores welcomed him again to the back parlor of Cottonwood , but instead of store-bought cookies fed him brick-like chunks of home-made banana bread that dropped into his stomach like sash weights . Bravely uttering little grunts of counterfeit pleasure , Albion put his hostess in the mood to supply him the information he needed . When he felt she \'d been warmed up enough , he told her about the library , and asked who it might have belonged to . Maybe Smith , the original builder ? " No , " she said thoughtfully . " In his day , Mr. Smith was a Presbyterian elder . Some quite respectable people are , you know . No , I           lived there just recently . " " Recently ? " he asked doubtfully . It turned out that Mrs. DeFlores had her own notions of what constituted recentness . " Yes . During the 1920s , I think . I used to hear stories about him in my younger days . When he first arrived in town , everybody was glad to see an enterprising young man take the place of old Dr. Thayer , who did n\'t believe in germs because he \'d never seen one . For a while , Dr. Welch enjoyed quite a substantial practice . Then stories about his rather aggressive and defiant irreligiousness began to get around . One expects doctors to be skeptical , of course , it comes from thinking about bodies all the time - they start to believe the soul must be a secretion of the adrenal glands , or something . But the way he made an issue of the matter did him no good in this town . We are in the Bible Belt , after all . In time new doctors arrived that people trusted more ,           . " " Shot himself ? " " Not with a gun . I suppose the correct phrase is shot himself up . He injected poison - hyoscine , I think . Do have another piece of banana bread , Mr. Merkel . It \'s so nice to find someone who appreciates my baking . Not everybody does . " That night Albion took two tablespoonfuls of Mylanta at bedtime instead of his usual one , but had peculiar dreams anyway . Nigel Bruce appeared ( as Dr. Watson ) but Basil Rathbone ( as Holmes ) kept calling him Welch . After some obscure chitchat , Holmes took out his famous hypodermic and injected himself with cocaine , remarking as he did so , " I have solved the riddle of the universe , Welch ! God \'s secret is that He \'s a secretion . " Welch burbled along in Watson \'s usual fawning manner , exclaiming " Pure brilliance , Holmes ! " then morphed into a lapdog and began licking Albion \'s face . He woke up . It was seven A. M. , and Miss           for her to bark at the morning rush hour , and go back to sleep . After breakfast , Albion put on old clothes and returned to the attic . Searching for a clue as to how to proceed , he began slowly leafing through volume after volume of Dr. Welch \'s collection . Clearly , he \'d been a man of forceful and uncompromising views . Scribbled in the margins of every book were his opinions , which were never less than emphatic : " Yes ! No ! Damned fool ! Unscientific ! Even that ass Benjamin Franklin knew better than this ! " The skeptics themselves had rarely been skeptical enough to suit him : he meted out praise as sparingly as the cook at a Victorian workhouse doling out porridge . One of the few who gained his whole-hearted approval was Democritus , whose icy view ( in De Rerum Natura ) that " nothing exists but atoms and the void " caused Welch to exclaim , " Yes ! ! ! ! ! ! " It was all rather discouraging . When Cyrene showed up           discoveries and asked whether she knew how to lift the cloud of unbelief that hung over the house . She said , well , they could try to contact Dr. Welch in the hereafter and ask him to help them lift the spell . Albion was dubious . " He seems to have been pretty hard-nosed , " he pointed out . " I \'m not sure he \'d want to help anybody . " " Oh , he was n\'t all bad , " she said , somehow flipping a bedspread so that it settled down in neat folds , like a military flag at sundown . " He was a mighty proud and scornful man , yet he doctored poor folks and would n\'t take no money for it . Black or white , did n\'t make him no never-mind . He looked after my mama when I was born . " Albion stared . If Mrs. DeFlores had her dates right and Dr. Welch had shot himself up in 1928 , then Cyrene had to be at least 79 years old . Yet every day the woman           workers . " He delivered you ? " asked Albion incredulously . " Well , not delivered . Mama just kind of drapped me when nobody was expecting it . But he come by the house afterwards and saw to her health and mine . Oops . " Something had flitted across the room . Albion looked here and there in bewilderment - had a sparrow flown into the house ? - then spotted a Haviland dinner plate balancing uneasily on the edge of his chest of drawers . Cyrene retrieved it , dusted it , and put it back in its usual place on the sideboard in the dining room . " Plates is the liveliest things , sometimes , " she muttered , returning to the bedroom . " Now , as to contacting Dr. Welch : I charges fifty dollars for a sance , and I ca n\'t be responsible for any breakage caused by sperrits . If that \'s acceptable , Mr. Alby , I think I got Sunday evening open . My daughter Altuna says it ai n\'t religious to summon sperrits on a Sunday           the Apostolic Fire-Baptized Church of Cod in Christ , and spite of the fancy name , none of those folks knows much . Oh , damn . " The plate had silently returned and now rested on Albion \'s pillow . " That \'s so mischeevious , " she said , frowning . " Now I know who \'s doing it . It \'s my little boy D\'White David . I named him for General Eisenhower , hoping he \'d grow up strong and brave , but he got whooping cough and passed in 1952 when he was only six . He been following after me ever since . " " He \'s not afraid to come into this house ? " " Not as long as I \'m here , " she said . " If I was n\'t , he would n\'t come in here even if you offered him a Tootsie Roll . " Albion agreed to the Sunday evening sance . Then , because he felt uneasy around children , never having had any of his own , he went outside and sat in the patio           with ( he supposed ) D\'White David clinging invisibly to one leg of her pantsuit . That weekend Albion had just finished watching 60 Minutes when his bell chimed , and he found a triad of visitors standing on his porch . " This here \'s Cousin Gordon , " said Cyrene , leading the group indoors . " And this is Cousin Na\'teesha . They works with me . And you do n\'t have to worry bout the money , Mr. Alby - the price is the same , come one , come all . " Cousin Gordon was an enormous black man who wore workmen \'s attire , even though it was Sunday . " I takes care of the Methodist Church , " he explained , his hand swallowing Albion \'s like a pelican ingesting a minnow . Cousin Na\'teesha was plump and fortyish , attired in a variety of fluttery garments and carrying an alligator purse . She had a soft voice almost devoid of Bonaparte \'s traditional Peckerwood drawl , and shrewd , watchful eyes . " Now the question is where , " Cyrene           asking , " Y\'awl smell anything in here ? Like ether ? I noticed it when I was cleaning . " She tested the dining room , the hallway , and the second bedroom that Albion was in process of converting into a study . In the end she returned to the living room and briskly ordered Cousin Gordon to move a small table beside the fireplace and bring in four chairs from the dining room . Albion felt cautiously impressed : the table was now precisely under the library in the attic . Cyrene ordered them to sit down and hold hands while she invoked a blessing . " Some folks think we should n\'t do this on the Sabbath , " she informed God in a confidential tone , " but I ca n\'t find nothing against it in Scripture . " ( That was intended , Albion supposed , to settle Altuna \'s hash . ) The lights were low . Na\'teesha \'s hand felt small , cool and a little moist , while Gordon \'s was huge , calloused and dry . Cyrene muttered and gabbled           once she asked rather loudly , " How far to the other side ? " Maybe it was a signal , for Albion felt a pull at his left hand . He looked up at Gordon \'s mountainous form and noticed for the first time that he too was asleep or entranced , breathing softly and regularly through his mouth . Was this a whole family of mediums ? If so , how did they split up the work ? As if answering his question , quite suddenly a woman \'s voice began to emerge from Gordon \'s lips . " This here is Aunt Sally , " the voice announced in the cracked tones of age . " Is that you , Natty ? Oh , and there \'s Cyrene , too . Who \'s the white fella ? I once knew everybody round Boney Part , but he \'s a new one on me . How \'s the weather down by y\'awl ? " " Kind of rainy , " said Na\'teesha . " How is it where you at ? " " Very bright , " said           " That \'s nice . I guess you \'re over the clouds there , so you get lots of light from the sun . " " Not from the sun , " said Aunt Sally . " Our light comes from the Son . " " Praise God ! " exclaimed Na\'teesha . " Now , Honey , much as I \'d love to visit with you a while , this gentleman is paying fifty dollars to contact a certain person name of Welch used to live in Smith \'s Haven . " " There I ca n\'t help you , " said Aunt Sally . " I remember Dr. Welch a little bit , but he ai n\'t up here with us . Come back when you got more time to chat , okay , Na\'teesha ? " The next twenty minutes were largely wasted , as a parade of unwanted spirits took the stage . A medieval archer babbled in Middle English , - an Irish servant girl who \'d died of typhoid in nineteenth-century New York gave thanks she \'d never again have to " scrub them           her Redeemer ; a U-boat crewman denounced die gottverdammte Englndei who \'d killed him with a depth charge in 1943 . One by one Na\'teesha dismissed these annoying wraiths , repeating over and over that Dr. Welch , of Bonaparte , Mississippi , was the only person wanted . And at last , with a suddenness that made Albion jump , a precise and cutting baritone emerged from Gordon \'s lips . " Why are you people practicing your superstitious folly in my house ? " it demanded . Na\'teesha responded , " Will you identify yourself , please ? " " Peter Paul Welch , M.D. Doctor Peter Paul Welch , " he added , in case those present were too dense to understand the M.D. " May I ask again what the devil you \'re doing in my surgery ? " " You practiced medicine in this room ? " " Madam , I practice medicine here every day . And I do n\'t rent out space for strangers to put on absurd mummeries . Belle , show these intruders out . " " Doctor Welch , do           Silence followed . Then : " She seems ... oddly familiar . " " Her name is Cyrene Foxx , formerly Cyrene Brown . " " That \'s quite absurd . Cyrene Brown is an infant . " " No , Doctor Welch . She \'s eighty years old . " " Are you insane ? " " You \'re dead , Doctor Welch . You died eighty years ago . You \'re a ghost . " Surprisingly , Welch \'s tone softened . " My dear woman , I must apologize for my earlier asperity . I see now why you \'re in my surgery . I suppose worried family members brought you here . However , you should know that I \'m a general practitioner , so I ca n\'t treat your mental problems . You need to see an alienist . Unfortunately , this benighted town does n\'t possess one , even though most of the people are crazy . Try Charity Hospital in New Orleans . " Albion bestirred himself . " But she \'s right , " he protested . " You aie a ghost           day ! " exclaimed Dr. Welch . " I wonder if it \'s catching . Could it be some son of toxin ? Hm . Have either of you eaten any moldy rye bread lately ? Open your mouth and say ah . Take off your shirt , sir - I \'ll need to palpate your abdomen . Are you , by any chance , seeing double ? This is turning out to be an uncommonly interesting day . " Albion was getting angry , something that his peaceable temperament seldom allowed him to do . But he found Dr. Welch \'s impenetrable wrongheadedness hard to take . " YO U .. . ARE . .. A ... GHOST ! " he almost shouted . " Now , now , now . We ca n\'t have any violence . You \'re clearly in need of a sedative . Belle , my dear , ask Jim to stop weeding the garden and give me a hand . I need him to hold somebody down . " But they never got to meet Jim , for the two mediums had had enough           from his trance . Shortly afterward Cyrene came to as well with a burp that caused her to beg everyone \'s pardon . While Albion turned up the lights and served coffee , she and Gordon listened closely to Na\'teesha \'s account of what had gone on while they were " under . " Cyrene thought that " Jim " might be Jim Joe Johnston , a notorious black gigolo of a few generations back , who \'d worked at gardening whenever the supply of women willing to support him temporarily gave out . " Belle " was a poser . Maybe a long-forgotten nurse ? " The doctor , I do n\'t think he had him a wife . Mama said he \'d been disappointed in love , being left at the altar by some gal had a fit of common sense just before it was too late . " Albion still had n\'t gotten over the impact of Dr. Welch \'s antipathetic personality . " Can you imagine a man who \'s been dead for eighty years insisting that he \'s still alive ? " he demanded .           go on fooling yourself . " But you know , Mr. Alby , ghosts do tend to cling to the past , being kind of leftovers themselves . " " Look at little D\'White , " Na\'teesha offered . " He wo n\'t never move on and enter the Light until Cyrene passes over and takes him by the hand . " " He always was a clingy child , " Cyrene agreed . " And , " said Gordon , speaking for a change in his own voice , which resembled a tuba solo , " look at all them sperrits been running round Cottonwood for a hundred and some odd years . Miz Sissy stays on because she was a sociable climber , and that was where she dumb the highest . Mr. Dick and Captain Jack stays around for the same reason dogs follow bitches . Why old Powderhorn stays , I \'m not sure . Ai n\'t no real bitches there I know of . " " It was good coon hunting round Cottonwood at one time , " said Cyrene . " Before they built           moved in . " As the triad was leaving , Cyrene - carefully folding Albion \'s check - gave him a last bit of counsel . " I \'m afraid you got you a problem , Mr. Alby , " she said . " You gon na have a hard time getting Doctor Welch to see sense and move along . He got a good side , like I told you , but at bottom he \'s a strong man and he \'s a wrong man , and that \'s a bad combination . Strong and wrong , " she repeated , shaking her head . " That \'s tough to deal with . " LBION WAS STILL brooding over the results of the sance when he had a telephone call from a neighbor . Placenta had applied for a cleaning job to Mrs. Lucy Jeter , who lived down the street , and Mrs. Jeter was checking her references . He had no problem saying that she was a good worker and honest and trustworthy . Since Mrs. J did n\'t ask about excessive familiarity or modernity , he           later he saw Placenta on the street , and she hailed him like an old friend . " Baby , that was so good of you , telling Lucy all those nice things about me , " she said warmly . " Especially after we had that little run-in between us . " After that , they exchanged chummy greetings whenever their paths happened to cross . One day she told him her son Antwon was coming for a visit and asked if she could bring him by . ( " And I \'ll leave the smokes at home , " she promised . ) Albion had no particular urge to meet a computer nerd who , he felt , was likely to be as big a bore as such people usually were . But in line with his basic essential laziness , he said , " Certainly , " because that was easier than saying , " No . " Thus , one evening his doorbell chimed again , and he greeted the duo of Placenta and Antwon Wilson . Antwon was thirtyish , as skinny as his mother           attired in skirt and blouse , he dressed like a true academic sloven . A triangle of torn T-shirt showed beneath his prominent Adam \'s apple , and a duo of unmatched socks peeped between the cuffs of his baggy tweeds and his battered L.L. Bean loafers . " I knew a guy named Merkel in Providence , " was Antwon \'s opener . " He was a Communist and I used to sleep with his sister . Would they be relatives of yours ? " This did nothing to get things off to a good start . After denying any relationship whatever with the Rhode Island Red and his sluttish sister , Albion served wine , crackers , and cheese - a domestic Brie , the best available in Bonaparte . Antwon ate it in big , expensive gulps , commenting as he did so that he never bothered to taste what he was eating because " it \'s just fuel . " Searching rather desperately for a topic of conversation , Albion mentioned that he \'d discovered the library of a doctor previously in residence at Smith \'s           first of Dr. Welch ( " Oh , an old horse and buggy doc , eh ? " ) , and then of books in general . " Ca n\'t see why anybody reads \' em any more . I do n\'t . Good Lord , it \'s like communicating by snail mail . " Forced to defend his obnoxious ghost against his equally obnoxious guest , Albion pointed out that opportunities to get on the internet had been rather limited in 1928 , when the doctor died . Antwon conceded the point : " Good Lord , 1928 . That was back in the Nixon Administration , was n\'t it ? " Placenta , who was no fool , saw how things were going and hastily brought up Albion \'s family history , of which he was inordinately proud . With little cries of interest and delight , she nudged him into admitting that the Merkels had long been pillars of the Gulf Coast - back when there was a Gulf Coast , that is . He could have discoursed very happily for a couple of hours on his           except that Antwon \'s face had taken on a zombielike thousand-yard stare . So , sighing inwardly , Albion did his duty as a host and asked about the Wilson family tree . It turned out to be complex . Like most southern families , the Wilsons counted both black and white relations . Placenta claimed DeFlores blood - from Captain Jack the Confederate , not from Mr. Dick the Scalawag , who unlike his brother had been a deadly foe of interracial coupling . She referred to the current Mrs. DeFlores as " the Yank . " Placenta \'s own Mama , Felice , had been the result of further mixing . After her birth , Placenta \'s grammaw Isobel had been visited by the Klan demanding the name of the father , which she refused to give , even under threat of death . At this point , noting that Antwon was again imitating a zombie , Placenta broke off her genealogical lecture . " You do n\'t like to hear this kind of stuff , do you , Baby ? " she asked , at last bestowing           head . " There \'s a lot I do n\'t know about where we came from . And there \'s a lot I do n\'t want to know . " This sentiment depressed Albion more than anything else the young man had said . How could anybody be uninterested in his origins ? After the Wilsons left , he was stacking cups and plates in the dishwasher when the phone rang . It was Mrs. DeFlores , inviting him for tea and banana bread . Of course he accepted , reminding himself to buy another blue flask of Mylanta at the Wal-Mart on his way to Cottonwood . Making chitchat , " the Yank " then asked him in her best gracious-lady voice what he \'d been up to lately . " Getting a look at the future , " he said somberly , thinking of Antwon . " Oh , so now it \'s crystal balls ? " she chortled . " My , you do get around . What did you see in the future , Mr. Merkel ? " " A blank page , " he answered           wrestled with the Dr. Welch problem , but without reaching any useful conclusions . He needed an exorcist , yet doubted that even the Jesuits in the movie could accomplish much in this case . Expelling Beelzebub from Georgetown was one thing . How would they get rid of a ghost who denied even being a ghost ? For lack of alternatives he returned to the attic and the armoire . He \'d already gone through every book but one , the last volume on the lowest shelf , whose technical subject and off-putting title ( Parasitic Worms ) had caused him to avoid it . Picking it up now , he noticed at once that it felt too light . He opened it and discovered that the book had been carefully hollowed out and turned into a hiding place for three string-tied bundles of fading letters . Feeling the kind of excitement that long ago had made Peeping Tom put his eye to a crack in his shutter , Albion untied the first bundle . The top letter , postmarked Aug. 16 , 1923 , was on faded blue           fancy script . My Darlingest Poo-poo , it began . A flapper you call me , in your darling pompous way ! Did anyone ever tell you you \'re a young fuddyduddy \' 1 . Yes dear Heart I am a flapper , even if not " five foot two , eyes of blue " as in that song you hate so much . But I am as loyal and true to you as the other Juliette was to what\'s-his-name in that play you made me read . I dream every single night of you - dreams that leave me faint yet tingling with an ardent warmth that previously I had only read about in books by French authors . This kind of thing went on for quite a while . The letter was signed For Ever and Ever , Your foo-joo . This hinted at a Peter Paul Welch , M.D. , of whom Albion had known nothing . Hands trembling , he unfolded letter after letter . The romance had begun when Dr. Welch was in his final year at Tulane Medical School . Papa says you must           we can be wed . Well , hurry on and get the dam \' degree then ! I ca n\'t wait forever and neither can you , if I can judge by the tendency of your trousers to form a tent when we are necking together ! ( Aren \' tla bad girl , though ? ) And do n\'t worry so much about money , my dear one . Papa is a mean man in some ways , yet I have been wrapping him around my finger since I was a little girl , and I know he will help us out . Apparently she was right , for Welch \'s graduation had been followed by the purchase of a small but lucrative practice in Bonaparte from an elderly doctor who was retiring . ( Presumably the one who \'d never seen a germ . ) Welch took up his duties , but the wedding was again put off . Joojoo \'s Papa wanted to be sure his prospective son-in-law would make a success of his chosen career , and packed off his daughter to Europe on the SS           longer . The result was disaster . The last letter was typewritten on legal letterhead and signed in a bold , slashing hand . The writer was Julie \'s Papa , and the letterhead proclaimed him to be Alfred M. Grinder , Attorney-at-Law . " I had thought , Welch , that my generosity in loaning you the money to obtain a practice might open the way to a marriage between yourself and my daughter . Needless to say , the infamous conduct of which you stand accused has rendered that forever impossible . My daughter , sir , will not enter a bed only just vacated by a Negress - worse , a Negress whose bastard brat you are accused of siring . Who do you think you are , young man - Thomas Jefferson ? " Much more followed , and it was no kinder than the opening . Grinder made threats of exposure and legal action and even a possible lynching . " The laws against miscegenation are not the only thing you have to fear , though the mere accusation would ruin you professionally . Good           community where you reside . Suppose you were publicly accused of being a traitor to your race , what might happen to you then ? Reflect upon it , Welch ! I want my money back ! And I intend to receive it , together with such interest as I may choose to demand of you . You will , sir , pay for your conduct - pay through the nose . " My ducats and my daughter , thought Albion . Who said that , anyway ? Shylock ! Exactly at this moment - sitting in the brown shadows of the attic , inhaling the dust of a bygone scandal - two names he \'d recently heard popped out of nowhere into his mind , fused and became one . Belle ! Isobel ! Placenta \'s mother Felice had been Welch \'s daughter by his black housekeeper , Isobel ( alias Belle ) Wilson ! The second sance held at Smith \'s Haven was not quite a duplicate of the first . Albion had communicated with Placenta , and the information he could now give her about her own           . Antwon was another matter . " I \'ll see if I can twist his arm , " was the best she could promise . The twisting must have succeeded , for the two Wilsons - one looking determined , the other sullen - turned up that Sunday evening in time for the festivities . Cyrene greeted them with marked reserve . Apparently Antwon had done no better job of endearing himself to black Bonapartians than white . Albion knew that Placenta was n\'t too popular either , on account of her California airs . ( Once in his presence Cyrene had referred to her as " the Sunset Stripper . " ) A larger table was needed , so this time they sat in the dining room , Cyrene remarking that " It ai n\'t Ground Zero , but it \'ll have to do . " Antwon was placed between his mother and Na\'teesha , Albion as before between Na\'teesha and Cordon , while Cyrene clasped hands with Cordon and the Sunset Stripper . As the preparations went forward , Antwon \'s expression seemed to be progressing from sullen           lowering glance and the teacher of computer science at least held his peace . As before , lesser spirits had to have their say . Aunt Sally revealed that the Holy Trinity was as big a mystery to the dead as it was to the living . A Swiss ski instructor who \'d just perished in an avalanche uttered a string of incoherent syllables from a mouth still full of snow and Germanic consonants . Either Edith Piaf or somebody who sounded remarkably like her sang a few bars of Non , je ne regrette rien . A Jacobean roisterer made the room tremble as he roared out denunciations of the Puritans as " slubberdegullion druggels , " whatever in the world that meant . As before , Na\'teesha disposed of these intruders briefly and decisively , until Dr. Welch \'s cold tones cut through the babble . " You two not in straitjackets yet ? " he demanded . " What can the authorities be thinking of ? " Na\'teesha nodded significantly to Albion , who cleared his throat and nervously began the dialogue . " Dr. Welch ,           Wilson ? " This produced so long a silence that Albion was afraid that the line to the other side might have , so to speak , gone dead . " Yes , " said Dr. Welch finally . " Allow me to introduce you to Placenta , her granddaughter , and Antwon , her great-grandson . Your granddaughter and your great-grandson . " " My ... my what ? " " I believe , " said Albion , with a coolness he was far from feeling , " that you understand me perfectly well . I trust you wo n\'t compel me to read to this company from Julie Grinder \'s letters , nor from that particularly nasty letter written by a certain attorney-at-law - " " No ! " shouted the spirit . " Have you no shame ? " " Have you no shame ? When in 1928 Klansmen visited Isobel Wilson - your Belle - to discover the name of her child \'s father , she refused to hand you over to them , even though they threatened her life . But others , including your           secret , I suspect from Dick DeFlores , who had a nose for such things . Was that when you decided to take the easy way out , leaving a poor black woman to raise your daughter alone ? " Silence again . But Albion , after a lifetime of being nice , had finally located the anger button in his psyche , and pressed it . " Speak up , man ! " he commanded . " Speak up ! " " Yes , " said Dr. Welch . From the changed tone , Albion could almost feel the spirit metaphorically squaring his shoulders . " That was what I did . I admit it . My whole life had suddenly come apart and I acted out of fear for myself , and no thought for her . I thought death meant annihilation . I thought I \'d never be called to account . I thought I \'d escape from danger and shame into the void - into nothingness . Well , I was ... I was ... I was ... wrong . " At this crucial admission ,           sigh of relief was interrupted when Antwon jumped to his feet , knocking his chair over backward . " You son of a bitch ! " he shouted . " You lousy pimp ! You swine ! You scum ! " " Now , Baby , " said Placenta , tugging at his sleeve . " It was all a long time ago . " Baby was having none of that . For a thirty-year-old man , Antwon managed to throw a tantrum that might have won respect from an ill-natured two-year-old . His language was n\'t as inventive as the Jacobean roisterer \'s , but he did his best with the banal four-and-five-letter invective of modern times . Placenta kept trying to stop the flow of denunciation , but Albion preferred to let it run , feeling that it was doing Dr. Welch less harm than he deserved . Finally Antwon burst into tears , probably tears of rage , and ran from Smith \'s Haven with Placenta in his wake . Na\'teesha , having sat open-mouthed during the scene , turned to Albion and said , " I           . " By this time the mediums were waking , stretching , returning to the world that is sometimes termed real . Feeling that something calming was in order , Albion opened a bottle of Cabernet that he particularly treasured because it had survived Katrina , and poured small glasses all around . When the events of the evening had been retold and digested , Cyrene suggested they bow their heads , join hands , and offer a prayer for the repose of Dr. Welch \'s soul . " He had good in him , you know , " she said , almost apologetically . " He just never let it come out enough , is all . " As the guests were leaving , she hung back for a moment and whispered to Albion , " His soul is finally in flight , I hope toward his Redeemer . Your house is clean now , Mr. Alby , I mean spirit-wise . Otherwise it needs a good dusting . See you on Tuesday . " WITH THE DEPARTURE of Dr. Welch \'s tormented and denying spirit , other and           by Gyrene \'s mediumistic powers . That perpetual six-year-old D\'White David was a thoroughly exasperating brat . Albion had to lock up his mother \'s good china - presumably D\'White could pass through the walls of the china cabinet , but he could n\'t get the plates and cups out - and keep buying new Wal-Mart dishware to eat from , as D\'White broke one set after another . Other spirits were much more agreeable . From time to time around midnight Albion \'s mother appeared in his bedroom to check and make sure he was properly tucked in . His father was sometimes to be seen gazing longingly at the wine rack , for spirits had been his problem long before he became one . A mysterious Blue Lady took to floating down the hall ; she resembled the only woman Albion had ever seriously considered marrying - considered so seriously and long that she married somebody else , in fact three somebody elses in succession , before dying . But the image was faint , the ID dubious , and the Journal of Psychical Research rejected an article           mournful of all the ghosts was a mysterious flickering blue creature that Mrs. DeFlores positively identified as Powderhorn . He frequently trotted over from Cottonwood ( or whatever gait dead dogs use to go visiting ) , favoring autumn nights when the dry leaves rustled like passing spirits and the huge brilliant harvest moon sucked the starlight out of the sky . Then , with Miss Scarlett watching him , fur bristling on her nape , he sat and pointed his muzzle upward and in long , moaning , sobbing howls expressed his yearning for the life of the flesh that was , sadly , forever beyond his reach . Eternity , he seemed to be telling Albion , was n\'t all gravy either . \n Forum ; Lawns and Gardens Thread : Help needed ! ! ! ! User Garden Warrior I \'ve got moles .

You know , now that I think about it , the tracks run in that direction . Do you think they were going toward it or away ? User : astroman-Fort . Worth Away . I bet there was a nasty chemical in that ice . Cyanide or something . Cyanide \'s common in comets and interstellar space . Something poisonous , anyway .

Then I got a sledgehammer and tried to break into it . <emoticon : shudder> Luckily , whatever they \'re made of is really tough . So it \'s not drifting my way ? User astroman-Fort . Worth Not at the moment . There \'s probably not yet enough to make a big , toxic plume . " Yet " being the operative word . User simpleguy38304 That \'s it . Reassure him . Nice job , astro . User . Garden Warrior No , that \'s OK In the basement , IVe got an old gas mask I bought years ago for Halloween . I also used           though we do n\'t have much air pollution in Iowa . Back then , it actually worked : at least , it took out the exhaust from the tractor pulling our float . And yeah , even then that seemed ironic . . . the tractor , that is . Maybe the damn thing still works . If I can find it . Back in a sec . User dnttellmymm We \'ve heard dut before . Maybe you should try the river . User astroman-Fort . Worth He \'ll be back . The gas is still fanning west . They \'re getting cases now as far as five miles out . Though nobody else is talking about pipes . When they hit Garden Warrior \'s street , they must have dived deep and stayed there . Do you think those things learn ? User survivolojest Most likely " thing , " not " things . " User biochick \' 03 Hey , joker-nun , you \'re back ! User survivolojest-bill Yeah . I saw the news . My real name \'s William , BTW UGW makes it through , we           be a lot more than GWs survival that \'s on the Une . They \'re seeing dead cows seven mUes out . Do you think this thing \'s building new hubs ? User biochick \' 03 Would n\'t surprise me . What is it ? An alien invasion ? User astroman-Fort . Worth For all we know , it \'s space kudzu . Maybe you really are safe out in Hawaii , biochick . User simpleguy 38304 I would n\'t count on it . I bet when it gets bigger it can go deeper . User misteri 2 Maybe it \'s some kind of nanotechnology . A terraforming gadget and we \'re the terra to be formed . User geolojest-bill Would n\'t that be " astroforming ? " Sony . Old habits . . . Anyway , it \'s staying underground , at least for the moment . What does n\'t it like on the surface ? The sun ? Wind ? Ram ? Air ? Us ? User astroman-Fort . Worth Whatever this thing is , it \'s killing plants as well as people , -clink : AP photos>           targets ? What would aliens- nanotech , space kudzu , or little green man - probably see as the most toxic gas on Earth ? User dnttellmymm Phosgene ? I do n\'t know . Probably something I \'ve never heard of . Can that polonium stuff be a gas ? User biochick \' 03 I meant the most toxic COMMON gas . It \'s oxygen . We need it to Uve , but back in evolutionary history the first photosynthetic bacteria nearly poisoned the planet with it before everything else either adapted or went underground . User astroman-Fort . Worth So you \'re saying oxygen \'s a weapon ? User biochick \' 03 Maybe . Or maybe I \'m wrong and we \'re all dead . Any better ideas ? User Garden Warrior Not from me . I found the gas mask and it seems to work . Or maybe it \'s just going tiirough the motions . If there \'s a way to check these things out , I do n\'t know it . User biochick \' 03 You also have to worry about dermal toxidty . Lots of           , gloves , etc . I ca n\'t promise they \'ll work , but they ca n\'t hurt . User Garden Warrior Already doing it . So have you guys come up with a plan ? User simpleguy38304 Yeah , swim , then run . User misteri 2 Why not just call the cops ? User astroman-Fort . Worth I \'ve been trying to do just that , but ca n\'t get through . GW , 12 \'s right : it \'s not your job to save the world . Or Iowa or however far this stuff might spread . User geolojest-bttl I \'m betting it \'s going for the world . IJS whether it \'s astroforming us or just trying to make a kudzu plantation , it \'s going to need to change more than a corner of Iowa . User Garden Warrior When I was a kid , my dad used to take me camping . Before we \'d go home , he \'d insist on cleaning up all the trash , even U it was n\'t ours . " If we do n\'t , nobody else will           n\'t think anyone else is going to get to this in time . I just switched on CNN . Every third word is " terrorist . " Even if we could reach FEMA or Homeland Security , I doubt they \'d take us seriously . So , to do it ourselves , what do we need ? User biochick \' 03 Oxygen , lots of it . Some way to break into the pipes . Then a way to blow the oxygen into them , preferably without dying first . Sure you do n\'t want to run ? User Garden Warrior Nope . Let \'s see what I can scrounge up . WeVe got a hospital , a high school that \'s presumably got a chem lab , and a couple of hardware stores . I doubt any of that \'s locked , but I \'ll take a crowbar , just in case . Wish me luck . User biodiick \' 03 Good luck ! Here \'s my ceU phone number if you need it . <Link : Personal side-note> I should have thought of that before . User astroman-Fort           \'m going to suggest a moratorium on chatter until GW gets back . Time \'s going to be vital , so let \'s not make folks wade through 101 useless posts . Only post if you Ve got something important to say . User dnttellmymm Sounds good to me . User simpleguy38304 Me too . But who died and made you king ? User biocWck \' 03 Shhh . User Mister 12 One question . Why did GW get bypassed ? Why did n\'t it gas him as it was tunneling by ? User astroman-Fort . Worth Who knows ? Maybe it figured it made more sense to start in the middle of town . If " figuring " plays any role in its behavior . Maybe it \'s genetic . Or programmed . User simpleguy38304 The stuff \'s continuing to spread . Ten miles now . He better get back soon . User biocWck \' 03 I just got a call from Wm ! He sounds pretty stressed , even through the mask . It seems he \'s just about the only living thing left in town . He           W a truck he borrowed when he found it blocking a street - though apparently " borrowing " meant pulling out the owner \'s body . User dnttellmymm Did he know die guy ? User biocWck \' 03 I do n\'t know , but it \'s a pretty small town . AU he said was it looked like the guy had coughed up big chunks of Ws lungs . The rest of the town , he says , is just plain eerie . Dead animals everywhere , aU the leaves dead on the trees , but just waving in the breeze , not falling off like it \'s autumn . There \'s nothing green anywhere near the city center , but at least his gas mask worked . And he \'s mad as hell . He too \'s been thinking about the fact the pipes bypassed him , and figures it means they did n\'t take him seriously . He wants to make them pay for that , but is going to need help . User dnttellmymm That \'s what we \'re here for . User biocWck \' 03 I           for him to text without taking his gloves off . He says the gas is indeed coming out of storm sewers , though only a few of them , so there must be a system of valves down there to direct it . He tried blowing oxygen directly into a sewer grating , but it just blew back out . He compared it to trying to use one baUoon to blow up anodier . What should he do next ? User astroman-Fort . Worth He needs to drill a hole in one of the upstream pipes and inject gas into it via an airtight fitting . That means getting back to his own yard , with . . . let \'s see , in addition to a drill , some copper tubing , superglue , quick-setting caulk , duct tape , super-strong strapping tape , and maybe some caustic chemicals to soften up the pipe . What would they have in that high school lab ? Sulfuric acid ? Sodium hydroxide ? Tell him to get some extra drill bits , because those chemicals may be as hard on them           have to be careful to drip the chemicals on only one spot or he \'ll make too big a hole when he breaks through , and have the storm-sewer problem all over again . User simpleguy38304 If he breaks through . User astroman-Fort . Worth Yeah , for all we know that stuffs immune to anything he can do . But as biocWck said , then we \'re all dead , so we might as weU presume he \'s got a chance . One other thing : he \'s going to need water to rinse off the acid , so it does n\'t eat through his fitting . Anything else ? User dnttellmymm An extra day to collect all this stuff ? User astroman-Fort . Worth Good point . Tell him that if he ca n\'t find everything , use what he can find . User biocWck \' 03 He \'s on the way home . Drilling commences in . . . five minutes ? User misteri 2 I hope his protective equipment holds up . User biochick \' 03 Me too . He \'s home , trying the drill           tries to push down on it and barely leaves a mark , even though he got a diamond-carbide bit from someone-or-other \'s machine shop . User simpleguy38304 Damn . If this does n\'t work , do you think the feds will figure it out in time to do something useful ? Nuke the place , in nothing else . Heck , they \'d never do that . Fallout in Iowa . Fat chance . They \'d let the aliens kill everyone first . User biochick \' 03 He \'s trying the acid now . He says he can now scratch the pipe , but not by much . He rinsed it off and tried the base . Same result . It works . . . but only slightly . He wants to know what would happen if he tried to alternate them without rinsing . User astroman-Fort . Worth Lots of heat . Hmm , it might actually work . Who knows what that stuffs thermal properties are . TeU him to watch out ; the mix might spatter , and if he holes his gas mask . . .           clear . It \'s working ! The pipe did n\'t soften - it cracked . He \'s in . User biochick \' 03 Widening the hole now , just enough to fit the tubing . Washing off the acid . He says gas is blowing out , but not all that hard . Apparently the flow is steady but not high pressure . User biochick \' 03 Mounting the fitting . . . Good , superglue binds to the pipe . . . Caulk . Duct tape . He \'s got it set so when one oxygen cylinder empties , he can take it out and put in another . User dnttellmymm Oh yeah ! Is it working ? User biochick \' 03 Too early to tell . He says that while he \'s waiting , he might as well attack the other pipes . He also says he \'s got an idea for another surprise for the allens- he seems to think they \'re terraformers , not kudzu . Meanwhile , he wants to know how long it \'ll take the oxygen to permeate the system . User astroman-Fort           of hours ? Too many unknowns . How much has he got , anyway ? User biochick \' 03 Enough that his back is going to hurt tomorrow from lugging it around , he says . There \'s more where it came from . User biochick \' 03 OK , there were six pipes total , counting one that was n\'t technically in his yard . He \'s into all of them , and on his second round of oxygen tanks for the first couple . He \'s now drilling second holes into them , hoping to double the dose . User biochick \' 03 His grass is dying , but everything \'s under control , he says . So he \'s off for more oxygen . . . and his surprise . User dnttellmymm Man , I hope it \'s a good surprise . My girlfriend thought she \'d surprise me for my birthday and got . . . never mind . Let \'s just say that toni was part of it . Ha ! Let \'s give the aliens some tofu ! User biochick \' 03 What \'s           else in mind , but he wo n\'t say what . User misteri 2 Is n\'t oxygen enough ? What are they saying on CNN ? Is it having any effect ? User astroman-Fort . Worth While he was working , the death zone was still expanding , but , let me check . . . yes , the rate of expansion has decreased . That does n\'t prove anything but it \'s a good sign . User biochick \' 03 " Great " he says , though he adds it would be nice if the gas mask allowed him to drink some coffee . How long do we think he should keep this up ? User astroman-Fort . Worth No idea . At least until the death zone quits expanding . User biochick \' 03 He \'s off for a third truckload of oxygen . He says that \'ll be the end of it . User astroman-Fort . Worth Damn I wish we could have gotten the feds to listen . They \'d have had a boatload of the stuff . Still , the death zone \'s not expanded           was as far as the stuff planned to go . User biochick \' 03 OK , he \'s back . Replacing empty oxygen tanks and starting to add his surprise to some of the taps . He stUl wo n\'t say what it is . " I love you guys , " is aU I can get out of him . It has something to do with the second holes he \'s drilled in all the pipes . User biochick \' 03 Oh no ! He \'s finally told me . I ca n\'t stop him ! User simpleguy38304 What the hell is it ? User biochick \' 03 Propane ! He \'s been adding it now for an hour . He figures a big explosion might make a nice coup de grace . He \'s going to kill himself ! User misterl2 Holy cow ! Did you see that ? Fox News had it . User dnttellmymm So did CNN . Wha \'d he do ? Toss in a match ? User biochick \' 03 Pretty much . User astroman-Fort . Worth Well he sure did something . They           User Farmer John X Hell , he probably did n\'t need the propane . That stuffs probably flammable enough on its own . Ever try lighting a cow fart ? Kinda like that , I bet . User simpleguy 38304 You speaking from experience ? User astroman-Fort . Worth Who knows , but he \'s got a point . If we \'re right that the aliens do n\'t like oxygen , odds are they live in a reducing atmosphere , which means any gas they do like is probably pretty explosive . User simpleguy38304 What about the impact site ? User astroman-Fort . Worth From the aerials , it looks like he got that too . I \'d been worried because the oxygen probably was n\'t blowing upstream . But it looks like the fire took out everything . I bet it ruptured the pipes , then produced a big backdraft or something . User nojest-bill What about GW ? He must have cooked himself . Will anyone ever know he saved the worid ? User biochick \' 03 I do n\'t know about that , but he \'s not           other than missing eyebrows and stinky hair , he made it ! He was out of contact because the blast knocked him silly , but he \'s mostly with it , now . Unfortunately , his house is on fire , but there are also flames all the way back to the river , so he \'s sure he got the source . If nothing else , when the flames subside , there will be all kinds of holes for air to get in and finish the job . Not that the feds will ever give him credit User dnttellmymm Or us . User biochick \' 03 True . But you know , I do n\'t think I care . What \'s the cheapest way to get to Iowa , anyway ? User simpleguy38304 Swim , then run ? User lumpylawnnot Jnjowa Hey , I just found this forum , and I \'ve got moles . Really . Zigzagging all across my lawn . Does anyone here actually know what I can do about them ? \n I was 6 when my mother told me she was buying five hens and a rooster for our backyard . She had always liked chickens , she said , and wanted to raise some baby chicks . I did n\'t know much about chickens , but I never would have imagined the terror they would bring . My father and I built the hen house and the wire chicken yard in a weekend . The five hens and the rooster arrived the following Tuesday . When I returned from school that afternoon , they were strutting about the pen and pecking through the grass . Not caring much for hens , or any females at that age , I took to the rooster and named him Leghorn . Leghorn was the meanest-looking animal I \'d ever laid eyes on . He was about half as tall as myself , rust-colored , and probably would have been a crime boss had he been a person . Leghorn had a way of standing up next to the chicken wire and staring sideways , never blinking , as still as if he were stuffed . He stayed like that until you put           then it might be a second , it might be a minute , he snapped like a steel trap and jabbed his beak at you . You never knew when it was coming . I \'d jump back three feet with my heart stopped . I lay in the safety of my bed that first night and laughed at thoughts of his efforts to jab me . Little did I know that only as soon as the next morning , my feelings for Leghorn would harden . Over breakfast , my mother informed me that feeding chickens had been added to my list of morning chores . My jaw dropped . I already considered myself overworked with trash duty and making up my bed and raking the yard every two weeks . Now , I had to be a chicken servant on top of all that ! Leghorn and his antics were no longer amusing . He was now my enemy . Over the next few weeks , I made up insulting chicken songs and sang them to Leghorn and his harem as I threw them feed . Chickens stink           when they \'re dead . I also found that it helped for me to think of Leghorn as my prisoner - a prisoner I could choose when and when not to feed . I \'d walk by the coop two or three times with a handful of corn , chin up , whistling , and pretending to have completely forgotten about chickens . After the third or fourth pass , I would nonchalantly toss the cracked corn through the wire and stroll away . " Momma ? " " Yes , Wally ? " " Leghorn \'s the meanest thing I \'ve ever met . " " Do n\'t be silly . He \'s just a chicken . " " I think he wants to kill me . " " I \'d imagine so , taunting him like you do . " " I do n\'t taunt him ! " She put her hands on her hips and stared down at me , " Wally . " Despite my display of resentment , Leghorn remained cool . He seemed to bounce back from whatever I dealt him . Sometimes ,           a prisoner who lifts weights and conditions his mind for survival . Not only did he still try to jab me through the fence , but he began charging and feinting like a boxer . At night I began to have strange dreams of fighting Leghorns that had grown smart and escaped . I \'d wake with my hands flailing in the air before realizing it was all a dream . Eventually , I \'d remember that Leghorn was out there in the darkness behind the chicken wire and that I did n\'t ever have to go in there with him . Little did I understand Leghorn \'s ingenuity . My crime boss prisoner of war had already taken several wives . I think he must have known that , as soon as my mother discovered eggs in the chicken house , she was going to make me check for baby chicks each morning . Which meant I had to enter the coop with the dreaded Leghorn . The first morning after the eggs were discovered , he wore a look of confidence that I \'d never seen . As           he strutted tall and proud around the corner to his entrance . I heard his sharp talons scratch across the wood threshhold and imagined his stopping just on the other side of the door that I had to open . I remained outside for several minutes , hands resting on the latch , envisioning Leghorn crouched like a runner , waiting for the gunshot . As the minutes passed , I thought that maybe I even heard him breathing in there . Maybe smelled him . " Leghorn ? " I called . There was no answer . " Leghorn , get away from that door . " Still no answer . " I \'m the boss of you , and you know it . " I heard a scratching sound inside . I imagined his feet pawing at the dirt like an angry bull \'s . I pulled my hand away from the door and walked around the chicken yard . From there , I was able to see into the back of the hen house where Leghorn \'s entrance was . As I was walking , Leghorn strolled           . He stopped . I took two steps . He took two steps . " That \'s it , Leghorn . You \'ve had it ! " The first thing I thought of was throwing a net over him . But then I worried he might get tangled and hurt himself and I \'d have to face my mother over that . After some more thinking , I came up with the perfect plan . I took a piece of plywood paneling up onto the roof of the hen house and dropped it in front of Leghorn \'s entrance . I would leave it there until I was finished checking for chicks , then climb back up and remove it . The plywood trick made Leghorn crazy . While I inspected the eggs , he ran about the chicken yard , flapping his wings and bouncing off the ground , neck stretched out and crowing one long crow - like a chicken howling . When I was finished , I climbed onto the roof again , pulled away the plywood , and watched Leghorn throw a temper tantrum below .           . He had never successfully stabbed anyone through the fence , and boarding his entrance robbed him of a chance to go one-on-one with me . He began to crow all day long like an insane person who yells at inappropriate moments . I invited my friends over to hear . The more he went off , the more we laughed . The more we laughed , the crazier he got . He rubbed his head in the dirt until he was mostly bald , with a few black feather stems sticking up . I began to think of him as my prisoner of war , who I was slowly breaking . " You better not forget who \'s boss , Leghorn , " I said every morning . He \'d rub his head around in the dirt , then look up and crow at me . I \'d begrudgingly toss some corn into the chicken yard and make up more chicken songs . There is an aspect of chicken-raising that the farmer she bought them from forgot to mention to my mother . If you do n\'t clip their           fly . Only in my nightmares could chickens really fly . Yet , one Saturday morning , I walked out of the house and saw one of the hens sitting on top of the azalea bush . The first thing I did was squint my eyes in confusion and stare at it . " How \'d you get- " Then , I froze like someone who has realized he \'s in a mine field . I started to slowly turn and look around . There he was , perched on the bottom limb of the camellia bush near our tool shed . He was staring sideways at me , what head feathers he had cow-licked into a Mohawk , scales shining on his legs , leaves and pine straw hanging from his wings . The camellia bush was situated close enough to the house so that Leghorn would be able to cover the distance to my front door before I could . There was only one option . 1 covered my head and ran for the hen house , hoping my plywood cover was handy . " Leeeeeghooooom \'s loooooooose           shake and then the whop- whop of his wings as he launched after me . I expected him to land on my head at any moment . I swiped the latch on the door and fell inside , kicking it shut behind me . I immediately looked at the back entrance . It was wide open , and the hens were squawking and bouncing out of it . I leaped up and reached outside for the cover , searing with adrenaline . I pulled it across the opening and sat in the loose hay that covered the floor , listening for Leghorn . Later that morning , I heard my mother calling for me . " I \'m in here ! " I yelled back . There was a long silence , then the door opened and sunlight fell across my lap . " Wally , what are you doing ? " " Leghorn \'s loose . He wants to kill me . " She backed out and looked into the chicken yard at the two hens there . " There \'s a hen that \'s missing too , "           now . " We did n\'t find Leghorn . I spent a month creeping about the yard , expecting him to ambush me at every hedge . My friends soon learned about the escape . With my embellishments , the threat of Leghorn \'s attacking us in the night overshadowed even the stories about the loose convict with long fingernails . That rooster had us all terrified . After a few more weeks , the threat of Leghorn eventually faded , and I began to think of him in an entirely different way . When I learned about Captain John Paul Jones in school , I thought of Leghorn yelling , " We have not yet begun to fight ! " When I read about Jeremiah Denton as a prisoner of war in Vietnam , I imagined Leghorn gripping the bamboo bars and staring at me with a look of defiance . When the President of the United States made a speech on television , it was a slicked-up Leghorn standing there . When I went to Disney World and rode The Pirates of the Caribbean , every pirate was           to embody the spirit and independence and perseverance of everyone I admired . I do n\'t miss our old rooster , but I guess he should be proud of himself . Leghorn. \n Last year of high school . I \'m with a girlfriend in a grungy diner in the West End of Toronto . Through the windows , flurries sprinkle from the sky onto the traffic , signalling the descent winter . Despite the weather , we \'ve been nursing an ice cream float . Mel has a definite boyish air - a welcome change from the stuck-up girls at school caked in their layers of make-up and hair products , who constantly obsess about the size of boys \' dicks . She does n\'t make me feel like a deranged gender anomaly - or at least , the only deranged gender anomaly . I look over the table at her . She seems bored . I \'ve tried connecting with her ; she \'s in my writing class , and we seem to share a love of writing and music . But she always feels cold and distant towards me . Sometimes I wonder why she even hangs around me . I think she \'s hiding something . Suddenly , I decide to come out to her . " I have to tell you something , " I say .           feel like a lesbian trapped in a boy \'s body , " I tell her . " Hmm ... " she muses , processing what I said . " Interesting you should say that , " she says . " Sometimes I feel like a gay boy trapped in a girl \'s body . " " Hmm ... " I reply . We pause silently with our dilemmas , and drift back to nursing our float . First year of university . The table I \'m sitting on gives that feel of a patient \'s room in a doctor \'s office : cold , sterile and professionally clean . But instead of medical posters showing crosssectioned layers of human anatomy , the walls feature the works of various contemporary pop-cultural artists , arranged neatly to calm the viewer-who is about to become a live canvas . My piercer walks in . He \'s a heavyset man who sports a goatee and , unsurprisingly , many piercings and tattoos . He seems calm , composed , and has a non-judgmental air about him-a very comforting first impression . " Hi ,           ; he \'s already wearing his medical gloves . Even though he \'s detached and professional , he still feels warm and comforting ; he knows his boundaries . " Nice to meet ya , " I reply , batting my lashes and smiling . " So where would you like your piercing done ? " he asks , as he gently marks several points on my face . He gives me a mirror . I look into the mirror and choose the one I want . " That one , " I say . " Great , " he says calmly , already focusing on the technicalities of his next work of art . I hand him the jewellery I chose earlier . He takes a fresh needle out of its sterile package and pulls up my upper lip . " Here we go ... " he says , approaching carefully . I feel a small poke-it must be just the initial pierce . " All done ! " " That \'s it ? " " Yup . " He hands me the mirror . I \'m not quite           " Hmm ... " I say , contemplating . " There was n\'t much pain . " " You \'re a natural , " he says . " And it looks cute on you . " " Thank you ! " I say , smiling . Then the blood rushes to my head and I have a quiet cathartic moment : I \'ve found a queer-positive space in a neighbourhood where people \'s body language usually reeks of condescending heterosexism . " The girl at the front will give you after-care instructions , " he says . " Enjoy ! " " Thank you ! " I say again graciously . " Oh , " I remember , " Happy Valentines \' Day ! " " Happy Valentines \' Day to you too , honey , " he says , smiling . I came here lost , confused , and alone on Valentine \'s Day . I now leave with a stronger sense of who I am , with the closet shut tightly behind me , marked by my new piercing . Happy Valentine \'s Day to me , and           It \'s my Stockwell Day crush again . I do n\'t know his real name . I just call him that because he shares a number of striking features with the former Alliance Party leader : chiselled cheekbones , a sharp haircut and a calm , professional air . He \'s a stunning example of a Caucasian man . I \'ve never actually spoken to him . I think he might live somewhere uptown , and I \'ve seen him walking around in the mid-town yuppie village . All he does is whistle at me when he spots me around the city , and each time I giggle like a schoolgirl and run away . I \'m a very mature individual , indeed . What does he see in me ? Is he just another tranny-chaser ? Does he have an exotic Asian fetish ? Or is he just another misguided man looking for love with the wrong person ? Even more perplexing , why am I so attracted to him ? Is it because he \'s a classic male archetype and he stands in contrast to my gender ?           - the kind of desire that whisks loneliness away . Who knows ? All I know is that casual flirtations like these wo n\'t last very long . He just whistled at me again while I was walking through the pedestrian lanes between cafs in the yuppie neighbourhood . I looked into his eyes again , but the game was already over-done - I had gotten bored of him . In my unresponsive gaze , he saw our precious , fleeting relationship crumble . Bedroom death - and we did n\'t even get to the bedroom . Third year of university : fashion trade show at the convention centre . Girls are everywhere . I \'m with my friend Kaley . As we walk down one of the aisles , a girl approaches us dressed in a suit jacket and skirt cut precisely to fit her tall , skinny dimensions . She has matching cut bangs , neatly drawn eyeliner , and just the right amount of foundation . She holds a clipboard sporting her agency \'s brand logo . " Hi ! " she says , pinning us with           . Have you ever worked for a modeling agency before ? " I shake my head . " I have , but it was a long time ago , " Kaley says . " Well , if you \'re interested , you can check us out at our booth , " the girl says . She gives us her business card . " Sketchy ! " Kaley says . " They just want your money . " I look at the business card . I fall back onto my bed . The morning \'s interview had been gruelling . The soulless agent had asked me lots of intimidating questions : attacks on my personality , tests of my attitude , and assessments of how I handle my image . She said I could make a lot of money as a model-more money than I \'d ever made . She looked at my photos and said she \'d contact me later in the day . I left her office feeling good , not because I felt any warmth from her , but because I was able to match her cold ,           and wait for her call . I see an old European stone road ; very steep , very tiring . The road never ends And neither do the designer stores that line it . I walk inside them , And never find what I \'m looking for . My eyes shoot wide open as I wake up abruptly , shaken by the dream . I feel sick to my stomach . I try to sit up , but my body wo n\'t lift . I feel the tear I ripped inside me between my body and my soul . I cry and press my face into my pillow . Is this the kind of pretty you want to be ? Is this the kind of girl you want to be ? Is this how you want to empower yourself to live out your gender ? The modeling agency doesn \' t care whether you \' re a boy or a girl - they just care if you make them money ! My cell phone interrupts me during my self-image crisis . I do n\'t want to answer - I know           , pull myself together , and reach for the phone . She says the agency wants me to sign on . She sounds spirited for the first time . I give her a half-assed excuse about conflicting schedules and how I could n\'t commit to modeling . Her tone reverts back to her empty professionalism and she thanks me for my interest . I let out a huge sigh , and look at the ceiling . Now how am I going to make money ? Still shaken , I slow my breathing to a regular pace . I grab a tissue , clear my sinuses , and wipe my tears . I close my eyes again . I do n\'t want to be a pretty white girl anymore . Summer of fourth year of university : Dyke March . I \'m exhausted from walking around downtown Toronto all day . The silicone boobs I borrowed from my trans girlfriend are driving me crazy - they fit oddly and they definitely do n\'t feel natural against my body . But I had fun anyway ! I wait for the streetcar on           parked a couple blocks away from the Village in a garage , away from the blaring stages , commercial booths and herds of people . .... The sun is beginning to set , but nightfall is still some time away . A middle-aged man crosses the street and walks toward me . " Hey baby , wan na have a drink with me ? " he asks up close , entering my personal space . " No , thank you , " I say , forcing a smile . I walk a few paces away , closer to some girls nearby . The man disappears . He suddenly reappears again behind me and wraps his arms around my shoulders . I freeze , paralyzed in fear . " C\'m on , I know you want it , " he says in my ear , massaging my chest . At first , my body does n\'t mind his touch , almost submits to it . But everything else - my mind , my spirit , my emotions - screams at once , terrified at what this strange man is doing .           " he says , and grabs my crotch . That \'s it . I yank his wrist away from my body . " No , I \'m not interested ! " I say loudly . " Okay , " he says . He walks away and disappears into the crowd . I let out a huge sigh of relief . The streetcar approaches . I look at the girls standing a few feet away from methey do n\'t even acknowledge my presence . I show my pass , ride the streetcar , and make my way to the parking garage . I open the passenger seat of my car and sit in the back . The garage is empty , except for rows of quiet cars . I take off my boobs and put them back in their box . I lie in the back seat , curl into the foetal position , and weep . This is not a day to be proud . High above , standing on a snowy mountain with my snowboard , I \'ve left behind the leering eyes , the cutting eyes , the           behind my back , the whispers of faggot under passing people \'s breaths , and the frustration I direct at myself for letting them get to me . My Pacific Island roots are with the palm trees , chinelas , and mangos , but I sprang up and flourished here , on soils thousands of miles away , in a place of cedars , flannel , and pine cones . I remember a language without gender binaries , but I can not speak it . I feel the sun on my brown tropical skin . It energizes my body as it shines down on the seemingly endless range of mountains . I stand in awe of what the Earth has to offer , and am reminded of how infinitesimally small I am in this huge swirling universe . I plop my board onto the snow and strap my feet in . I smooth my hair and coat and feel the sun \'s warmth flow through my body . I look down the mountain to where I have to go , and prepare my spirit for everything that the world lays   \n Delmer Dawkins leaned across the circular bar table , pinning his copy of the National Revealer beneath one jacketed elbow while he gestured wide with his other hand only inches in front of his companion \'s saturnine face . " It \'s bigger than we thought , " he said in a whisper that echoed off the glass wall beside them . Beyond , the city of Seattle glistened in the late evening sunlight . " It \'s not just NASA . We \'re pretty sure SETI , the Air Force , and the Catholic Church are in on it , too . " " Is that so ? " Leo Stevenson leaned back a few inches , but Delmer followed him , his tie nearly dipping into the glass of mineral water he \'d forgotten in his excitement . " Yes , it \'s so . But they \'re not as big as us . We \'ve got our own people in high places . Very high places . " Leo smiled . " Where , the Moon ? " Delmer narrowed his eyes . Was Leo making fun of him ? Or was he just putting on           That was the trouble with conspiracies ; even your friends could be in on them , and you never knew for sure . But Leo was above suspicion . Not because he was too honest to have secrets , but because he was too greedy . Leo was a Hollywood producer ; if he knew anything about a clandestine space program , he would have made a movie about it years ago . " Do n\'t laugh , " Delmer said . " That \'s where we think their secret base is . On the far side , of course , where astronomers ca n\'t see them . " He shook his head sadly . " The legitimate astronomers , that is . Not all of them are on our side . The conspiracy has spread to academia , too . " Delmer scanned the bar nervously . There were a dozen or so occupied tables ; most of them held couples deep in conversation , but at one a lone woman nursed a drink and glanced at her watch , and at another sat a man reading a newspaper           . In a real whisper this time , he said , " We \'re being watched . " " Really ? " Delmer admired the cool way Leo rattled the last few ice cubes in his empty rum-andCoke glass , then sucked one into his mouth , never once looking up . He acted as if it did n\'t matter to him in the slightest whether federal agents shadowed him in hotel bars . As if the whole situation were inconsequential , a lark . " There \'s just one thing that bothers me about all this , " Leo said , not even bothering to lower his voice . " How could the government start a secret space program and put a base on the Moon and all that , and manage to keep it secret for twenty years ? Come on now , you \'re talking about the same people that screwed up Watergate and could n\'t keep Clinton \'s sex life or the Bin Laden connection under wraps . " " Clever diversions , all of them , " Delmer said softly , wishing Leo would quiet           n\'t even pretending to read anymore . " Diversions ? " Leo asked . " That \'s right . Some of our agents were getting too close to the truth , so they started a scandal to mask the internal shakedown . It \'s one of the oldest tactics in the book . " " Is it ? " Leo crunched on his ice cube , swallowed . " Do n\'t scoff at the government . They kept the F-117 Stealth Fighter secret for years . " " Hmm . " Leo shrugged . " So what are you going to do about this Black Space Program of yours , now that you know it exists ? Sell people UFO insurance ? " Delmer ignored Leo \'s dig . Ever since Leo had scored big in the movie industry , he loved jazzing his former college buddies about their mundane professions . Well , Delmer would impress him before the evening was over , he knew it . " We \'re going to blow it wide open , that \'s what , " he said . " We \'ll start           just behind his left elbow . He turned in his chair , expecting to see the muzzle of a gun pointed at him from beneath a folded newspaper , but instead he saw the single woman from the other table . She was tall , rail thin , with dark blond hair that fell in bangs just short of aquamarine eyes . She wore no makeup , and her clothes , from the blue and green flannel shirt to the tight Levis to the canvas hiking-boots , looked like a tourist \'s attempt to mimic the local grunge scene . Definitely not an executive look . " Excuse me , " she said , smiling shyly . Her voice had a slight drawl . Delmer guessed Texas or maybe New Mexico . " I was supposed to meet someone here at seven , but I just realized my watch is n\'t working . Do either of you have the time ? " Both Delmer and Leo immediately looked to their wristwatches and said , " Seven thirty . " " Seven thirty-one , " Delmer amended when he saw the           sure I missed him , then . Sorry to have bothered you . " " Not at all , " Leo said magnanimously . The woman took a step past them as if to leave the bar , but her hip bumped the table . Delmer \'s mineral water sloshed , and he reached to steady it , but she was quicker . " Sorry , " she said , setting the glass back down in front of him . She flashed a quick smile , then turned away again . They watched her weave her way through the tables to the door , Leo apparently with simple lust , Delmer with suspicion . What had she been up to ? Was her sudden appearance some kind of warning ? When she disappeared into the lobby , Leo turned around and picked up his glass . Three or four ice cubes were all that was left in it , and they clung stubbornly to the bottom when he tilted it up to his lips . " Here , let me borrow some ofthat , " he said , picking up           the top of it into his own glass to float the ice cubes . " Wait ! " Delmer said , grabbing his arm . He \'d figured it out . " Do n\'t drink that . She poisoned it . " Leo rolled his eyes . Prying Delmer \'s hand loose , he said , " Del , do n\'t you think you \'re taking this conspiracy business a little too seriously ? She did n\'t poison your drink . " Embarrassed by Leo \'s patronizing tone , Delmer asked , " Then what was she doing here ? " " Asking the time , " Leo said . He took a big gulp of water , slurping in one of the ice cubes . He smiled wide at Delmer while he swallowed , as if to say , " See ? " but his smile suddenly changed to a grimace of horror . He spit the ice cube back into his glass and said , " Then again ... " but he never finished . His eyes rolled upward and he tilted forward until his forehead rested on           whispered . He looked up at the other bar patrons , but the couples at their tables had n\'t noticed anything , and if the man with the newspaper had , he was n\'t making a move . Delmer felt completely alone . His confident " we " a few minutes before had been bravado , nothing more ; the truth of die matter was he had never met another person who believed in a clandestine space program , or in Bigfoot or the face on Mars either , for that matter . He \'d only read their articles in the newspapers . He looked back down at the top of his friend \'s head . My God ! he thought . Leo is dead . Whatever the woman had slipped into the water had killed him instantly . And Delmer would no doubt be on the top of the suspect list . He \'d frequented this bar often enough over die last few years , somebody was bound to recognize him . . . Still , he could n\'t waste time worrying about himself . Leo was dead !           Here was his proof that the Black Space Program existed , but how could he use it to convince anyone ? Delmer tried to think : What should he do now ? There was no way he could save Leo , but if he acted fast he could at least track down the woman who had killed him . And maybe , if he played it right , she would give him the proof he needed to blow the whole story wide open . Yes , that was it . If Leo \'s death was to mean anything at all , then Delmer had to use it to put pressure on the government . Get them to come clean with the nation . He stood up from the table and strode out of the bar in search of die woman . She was just getting into a taxi when Delmer reached the parking lot . He raced for his own car and squealed out of the lot only a block behind it , following as inconspicuously as possible . When the taxi merged onto 1-5 going north , he closed           cars behind as it switched to 520 and crossed the floating bridge into Bellevue . It seemed as if half the buildings lining the freeway belonged to computer manufacturers or software companies . " Of course ! " Delmer muttered to himself . " The computer industry has to be in on it as well . Jeez , why did n\'t I think ofthat before ? " The taxi pulled off the freeway and swung around the block into a Red Lion Hotel parking lot . The woman got out and entered the lobby , but as soon as the cab had gone she came right back out , walked through the lot to a parked car - a black Mercedes - and drove away . Delmer followed her to another hotel where she switched cars again - this time to a black BMW - then she led him through winding streets to a sprawling mansion built into a hillside . An electric gate blocked the driveway ; Delmer drove on past , pausing only long enough to write down the address . Then he headed for a phone booth           private investigators . Delmer groaned as he saw page after page of ads promising discretion , confidentiality , and affordable rates . How could he know which ones were legit and which ones were already part of the conspiracy ? A wrong guess would be disastrous . Then he could n\'t afford to guess . He would have to consult a higher power . With a newfound sense of determination , he scanned the pages of the directory , glancing at the names just long enough for them to register in his subconscious mind , then he went back to his car and took his Ouija board out of the trunk , sat down in the passenger seat with the board on his lap , and placed the fingers of both hands on the planchette . It would work better with two people , but Delmer did n\'t have time to track down a compatriot to help him . The oracle would have to work through him alone . He let his wrists and forearms go slack , then focused on the alphabet spread across the board and tried to           , the planchette began to move . " You know , Elvis served me a burger once , back in \' 83 . I \'m sure of it . " Sidjaimeson , the investigator , paused to light a cigarette , puffing the smoke toward the windshield , where it curled around and drifted straight toward Delmer . Delmer cranked his window down a couple of inches . " Elvis , huh ? " he said distractedly . They \'d been watching the house behind the iron gate for a couple of hours now . " Yup . In a little Mom &; Pop diner in Kalamazoo , Michigan . He \'d shaved off his sideburns and his hair was a lot shorter , but you ca n\'t fool a trained eye . It was Elvis all right . " " Wow , " said Delmer . " What \'d you do ? " Sid blew more smoke at the windshield . " Nothing . It was n\'t any of my business . " He was silent for a minute or more , then he said , " Well ,           let him know I knew . But I did n\'t tell anybody , if that \'s what you mean . " Delmer grinned . " You just told me . " Sid grinned right back . " I told you the wrong town , too . " " Oh . " Delmer was momentarily crestfallen , but then he realized Sid was just being professional . " You know , " he said , " I \'m glad- " " Look sharp , " Sid interrupted . " Here she comes . " He stabbed out his cigarette in the ashtray , and the two men hunched down in their seats as the iron gate swung open and the black BMW slid silently out into the night . It was halfway down the block before its driver turned on the lights . Sid started up his car and pulled out after her , keeping a full block behind until she got into heavier traffic , then closing up the distance and following her onto the freeway . She drove south all the way to Renton before getting off on 1           she be doing way out here ? " Delmer asked as they drove past Enumclaw and turned east on 410 . " Could be anything , " Sid said . " Making a drop , meeting a contact , disposing of a body - you name it . " Delmer shuddered . He wondered what had happened to Leo \'s body . How long had he sat there face down in the bar before someone noticed him ? Had anyone described Delmer to the police ? Were they even now ransacking his apartment for clues ? That much was certain ; if not the police then the Black Space Program people . And both organizations would no doubt post guards to catch him when he returned . Which meant he could n\'t even go home . He could call in from a pay phone for his messages , but that would be it . The road had begun climbing into the Cascade foothills . Now that they were the only two cars on it , Sid had dropped way back , so they just glimpsed the BMW \'s taillights as           Then they came to a twistier section and did n\'t see the car at all for a few minutes , but the road straightened out again and there it was , stopped at a pullout . It was too late to stop without being obvious . " Duck down , " Sid said as he drove on past . He took them around the next corner , then killed the lights and turned the car around on the narrow road . With the engine off , and using just the emergency brake so the lights would n\'t come on , he coasted them back down until they were just peeking around the corner . The BMW was an inky patch of darkness under the starlight , growing more visible as their eyes adapted to the dark . " She \'s got to be meeting someone , " Sid whispered , as if his voice could carry the quarter mile to the other car and give them away . " She has n\'t even gotten out of the car . " " What if they come down from above ? "           but Sid leaned forward and looked up through the smoky windshield . " Holy shit ! " he whispered . Delmer leaned forward to see what he was so excited about . Sure enough , there was a glowing ring of red and green lights descending toward them from high in the northwestern sky . Sid reached back into the rear seat and grabbed his camera . Rolling down his window , he leaned out and started snapping pictures as the LIFO dropped silently to a stop beside the BMW . It dwarfed the car . Delmer guessed it was thirty or forty feet tall and twice as wide . It was circular , the classic flying saucer design with a bulge on the top . Through the transparent bubble , Delmer could see silhouettes of two humanoid pilots sitting at a control console . The BMW driver \'s door opened , and the woman from the bar stepped out . She was bathed in pulsing light from the UFO . Sid kept clicking away with the camera as a ramp descended from the underside of the saucer and the           got \' em , " Delmer whispered triumphantly . The ramp slid back into the saucer , the lights brightened , and the UFO rose up into the air again . Delmer expected it to shoot straight up , but instead it slid silently up the road- straight at their car . " Uh oh , " Sid said . He handed Delmer the camera . " Hold that and put on your seatbelt . Things could get bumpy here . " He waited until he was sure that the UFO pilots had indeed seen them - which was unmistakable when a beam of bright white light shot out from the edge of the saucer and lit up the interior of the car like the inside of a flashbulb - then he turned the key in the ignition . The engine rumbled to life , then immediately died . When Sid tried the key again , nothing happened . Not even the starter motor turned over . " They \'re using a dampening field ! " Delmer squeaked . " They can stop engines and stuff from working . "           just see if they can repeal the law of gravity . " He released the emergency brake and the car began to roll down the highway toward the parked BMW . " I think they can . " Delmer clutched the edge of the seat in panic , as if that might help hold them to the ground . When they came under the UFO , all the loose pop cans and napkins and maps and stuff in the car rose up to bang against the roof , and both Sid \'s and Delmer \'s hair rose straight up as well , but their seatbelts held them in place . The camera shot up out of Delmer \'s hands , but he snagged the strap and reeled it back down to his lap . The car rocked as if in a strong wind . Sid cursed as he fought for control , but the car did n\'t leave the ground . Then they passed out from under the disc and all the debris rained back down on them . " All right ! " Sid shouted . " We \'re           the car so it was pointed down the center line of the highway , and they began to pick up speed . The UFO floated along behind them , pinning them in its intense light and sweeping its anti-gravity beam across them time after time , but Sid kept the car on the highway and by the time they reached the first curve they were doing nearly forty miles an hour . The road swept around to the left , and in the middle of the curve the car suddenly got light again . Delmer expected it to skid off into the trees , but instead it did the opposite , oversteering hard to the left . Sid corrected for it , batted a pop can aside , and said , " They \'re playing with our inertia . Well let \'s just see if we can play back . " He hit the brakes hard , and the car stopped instantly , without even squealing the tires or throwing Sid or Delmer against their seatbelts . The UFO swept on ahead , and Sid reached into his jacket ,           floating pop cans fell to the floor again , then leaned out the window and fired three rounds at the UFO . The report echoed off the trees beside the road . It was like hitting a baseball . One moment the UFO was there ; the next it was careening through the sky toward the northern horizon . " Hah , thought so , " said Sid . " What ? " asked Delmer . The engine suddenly coughed and rumbled to life , without Sid touching the key . " Aha , their damping field must have a range limit . Hang on . " Sid stepped on the gas and the car sped down the hill . " What made them zoom away like that ? " Delmer asked , gripping the dashboard as Sid swerved the car around another corner . " They would n\'t be afraid of a gun , would they ? " " I doubt it , " Sid said , " but if they can play with gravity and lower inertia , then I figured that \'s what they use to keep           around the sky and make sudden stops and all , I figured they probably do n\'t weigh more than a couple of grams . So I sent a couple more grams of high-velocity lead toward \' em . Just like playing pool ; the momentum has to go somewhere . " Delmer wondered if that was such a hot assumption , but apparently it had worked . Not for long , though ; the UFO stopped just as quickly as it had gone , and like a ball at the end of an elastic cord , it shot back toward them . " Time to call in the cavalry , " Sid said . He pulled his cell phone from his hip and flipped it open , dialing with his thumb while he drove . The road bottomed out and began to rise again . Sid punched the gas and the car shot up the other side , then the engine coughed and died again . He shoved in the clutch , and they coasted on up and over the crest of the rise . Delmer was afraid that the           but a moment later Sid said , " Marty ? Sid . No , no time ; listen , I \'ve been following somebody , and I think I stumbled onto a major drug deal . I want you to send the chopper and as many cars as you can spare . Damn right they \'ve spotted us ; they \'re chasing us down the side of Mount Rainier right now . On 410 , right . Tell \' em to get here quick ; the dealers are faster than we are , and I do n\'t know how much longer I \'ll be able to hold \' em off . Right . Thanks . " Sid thumbed off , tossed the phone to Delmer , and laughed at Delmer \'s surprised expression . " But - why did n\'t you tell them the truth ? " " What ? Marty \'s a nice guy who just happens to work dispatch at the Puyallup field office , but if I call him up and say \' UFO , \' he ca n\'t do a thing to help me . Say           " The phone buzzed in Delmer \'s hand . He nearly dropped it in surprise , but managed to flip it open instead , bracing himself against the door as the car swerved around a hairpin turn , and say , " Uh . . . Sid \'s car . " " Who the hell is this ? " a deep voice asked . " Delmer . . . uh , a friend of - " Delmer said , but Sid grabbed the phone from him before he could say more . " Sid here , " he said . Delmer gasped as the UFO swept its spotlight and anti-gravity beam across them again and the car lurched toward the inside of the turn . Sid cursed and jerked the wheel straight again , then said into the phone , " Nope . Hold on . " He dropped the phone in his lap , pulled his revolver out of its shoulder holster , transferred it to his left hand , and leaned out the window to fire three more shots into the air . The UFO streaked away again           among the stars . Sid holstered his revolver and picked up the phone again . " Sorry , I had to persuade \' em to back off . Hell , yes , that was gunfire . Get your asses up here or you \'ll be readin \' my obit in the morning . " He thumbed off the phone and tossed it back to Delmer . " What did he want ? " Delmer asked as the car \'s engine started up again and Sid accelerated hard down the road . Sid laughed . " He wanted to know if I \'d seen any funny lights in the sky . Said they \'re getting all sorts of calls about it from out this way . " " Good , " Delmer said . " Maybe they \'ll believe us now . " " They \'ll believe us when I show \' em the photos , " Sid said . " Not before . " He leaned his head out the window and looked up . " You know , I believe our flying friends must have been listening in on           they \'re coming back . " He slowed the car and continued driving down the mountain at a more normal pace . After a few minutes they saw a highway patrol car speeding toward them with its lights flashing , and Sid blinked his headlights to flag them down . Delmer let Sid do the talking , and he was impressed with how few details Sid had to change in order to make the story sound completely believable . He even said straight out that the car full of drug dealers " took off like a rocket " when he fired on them the second time , and he and Delmer had n\'t seen them since . The helicopter showed up not long afterward and began sweeping the roadside with a spotlight that seemed like a dim flashlight after the UFO \'s bright beam . Sid and Delmer stuck around for a while , putting up a show of helping with the search , but when it became apparent to everyone that the bad guys had slipped through the net , Sid thanked the cops for saving his bacon and           Sid dropped Delmer off at the parking lot in Bellevue where he \'d left his car and they split up for the night , Sid to go download the photos he \'d taken and Delmer to hole up somewhere until morning . He did n\'t particularly like die idea of spending a night alone in a motel , but going home was out of the question , and as Sid pointed out , staying together made them a bigger target . So Delmer waited until Sid drove away to the north , then went the other direction , eventually finding a cheap motel near the airport . He bought a copy of the National Revealer from a late-night grocery down the street and fell asleep reading the news . The next morning Delmer called Sid \'s office number , but he just got an answering machine . He called Sid \'s cell number , but that went to voicemail , too . Delmer fussed around the motel room for another hour , giving Sid time to get to work , then called again . Answering machine again . Maybe he           doing any good at the motel , and he was going to have to check out soon anyway , so he decided to risk driving over to the office in person . When he got there , after battling Seattle \'s rush-hour traffic into the downtown area , he found that he was too late . The UFO people had already been there . The office had been ransacked ; file cabinets lay on their sides and papers were strewn everywhere . Delmer took one look , then spun around and rushed back to the street . The sidewalks were full of people ; it was impossible to tell if anyone was watching him or not . As nonchalantly as he could , he walked with the crowd for the block and a half to his car , then he ducked inside and started it up and pulled out into traffic , cutting off a taxi whose driver honked the horn and cursed at him as he drove to the next light and turned right . The taxi went on , so Delmer went a couple of blocks before turning           pulled into a parking lot where he slid into a slot between a van and a pickup camper . He switched off the car and watched in the mirror for signs of pursuit , but it looked like he \'d gotten away clean . He wondered how much longer he could elude them , though . They \'d taken Sid , and Sid did this sort ofthing for a living . Delmer slumped in his seat . Living . God . He could n\'t go home , and he could n\'t go to work , either . In a couple of weeks the UFO people could just start searching the park benches at night and eventually find him . He had to do something to turn the tables . Take the initiative and put them on the run . But what could he do ? Sid had kept the camera , and now the UFO people undoubtedly had it , so he did n\'t even have any proof that they existed . All he had was the address of the house where the woman had gone last night . But           two cameras , for all they knew . And half a dozen compatriots . Smiling for the first time in hours , Delmer opened the glove box and took out a pen and his car logbook , tore out a blank sheet , and began composing his message . They met by the fountain at the Centc , th old World \'s Fair site in the middle of town . The Space Needle towered overhead like a flying saucer speared on the Eiffel Tower ; a fitting omen , Delmer thought , for the business at hand . He waited in plain sight , trying to project an aura of confidence . Either they believed his threats of setting up blind mail drops to the press or they did n\'t ; skulking about and trying to spot their agents before they spotted him would only cast doubt on his story . So he watched a couple of high-school kids tossing a Frisbee back and forth across the open bowl of the fountain until he heard footsteps approaching him from the side . He looked over casually , then felt his           ! " The friend he \'d watched die from poison in a hotel bar reached out to steady him , and Delmer wrapped his arms around him in a tight hug . " Leo , how did you ... " Then he noticed the blond woman dressed in imitation grunge standing behind Leo , trying not to smirk , and realization came all at once . " You \'re one of them , are n\'t you ? " " Got it in one , " Leo said , gently disentangling himself . " Wow , " Delmer whispered as the implications hit him . If Leo was in on the conspiracy , then it had to be even more far-reaching than he \'d thought . " You were trying to scare me off , " he said . " Two for two , " said Leo . He sat down on the stone rim ringing the fountain . " It worked for your detective buddy . He agreed to keep quiet after we ransacked his office . You \'re a stubborn S.O.B. , though . I \'ve got to admit           . No matter what , he had to keep playing the role . So , as gruffly as he could manage with a throat that was still all choked up with relief over finding his friend alive , he said , " Do n\'t do it again . " Leo laughed . " We wo n\'t . " " Good . " Delmer looked over to the woman who \'d come with Leo , but she was no longer standing where she \'d been . As casually as he could manage , Delmer scanned the crowd , but she had disappeared . Gone home , or gone into hiding to better protect Leo ? Delmer decided not to make any sudden moves , just in case . " No , we \'ve decided you \'re a big enough pain in the ass , we \'d be better off having you on our side . " Delmer had to put his hands down on the stone to hold himself upright . All his preconceived notions had been smashed to splinters in an instant . The Black Space Program wanted him ?           looked into Leo \'s eyes to see if he could spot any hint of deception there , but he saw only friendly amusement in his expression . " Really ? " he asked . " And Sid was n\'t ? " " Sid \'s a detective . They learn real quick not to mess with things that \' re bigger than they are . Not unless they \'ve got enough leverage to deal with it , which he did n\'t as soon as we found his camera . " " Well , I \'ve still got mine , " Delmer said . " Or my buddies do . But before I agree to join anything , maybe you ought to tell me just who I \'d be joining . " Leo nodded . " Fair enough . You had it pretty close , you know . NASA and the Air Force are in on it , and most of the major defense contractors . And the Catholic church ; you got that right too . The only one you missed was the movie industry . We \'re in it clear           n\'t made any movies about it ! How could you keep it quiet ! " Leo laughed . " We have n\'t , really . All those nifty special effects you \'ve been seeing for the last couple decades - that \'s not computer-generated . Most of it \'s actual footage . We \'ve been making a fortune off this , but we just have n\'t put it all together into one big film yet . " " Wow , " Delmer said . " You mean Star Wars is real ? There really is a battle going on out there ? " " Probably somewhere , " Leo said . " It \'s a big universe . But no , Lucas just dresses up a few dozen ships to look like fighters and makes adventure movies . " Delmer shook his head in amazement . " Special effects . Of course . Jeez , how could I have missed that ? " " Hey , do n\'t be too rough on yourself . You were n\'t supposed to figure out any of it . " That made him feel           Leo had n\'t mentioned . " What about SFTI ? " Leo shook his head . " They \'re still in the dark . " " Why ? I \'d have thought the alien contact people would be your top guys . " " They would , " Leo said with a smile , " except we \'ve already made contact years ago . " Delmer nodded knowingly . " Of course . 1947 , Roswell , New Mexico . " Leo nodded . " Among others . Our base on the far side of the Moon is full of \' em . Well , what do you say ? Will you join us ? " Delmer had to fight to keep from babbling . Of course he \'d join them . He \'d do it just for the chance to ride into space aboard a genuine UFO - though he supposed they were no longer unidentified , at least from his point of view . But was Leo \'s offer sincere ? Delmer wanted to think it was , but after the last day \'s experience he realized he           afford to let them think he did . So he nodded slowly and said , " I \'ll join you on one condition . If I do n\'t like what I see , you let me go in exchange for my silence . I \'ll keep my photos of your people and your ship , and I \'ll keep my blind drop setup so you ca n\'t double-cross me , and we \'ll both just go on about our business as if nothing had ever happened . " Leo did n\'t look happy . " We \'d rather not have that threat hanging over our heads , " he said . " I mean , what if something happened to you , something we did n\'t have any control over ? Then your buddies e-mail the photos and we \'ve got no end of covering up to do . " " You \'ll just have to make sure nothing happens to me , " Delmer said . Still frowning , Leo said , " Look , just between friends here , let me warn you : your photos are n\'t           but they wo n\'t shut us down . So if you become more trouble than your photos would be , then I \'m not going to be able to help cover your ass , you understand ? " Delmer shuddered . What was he getting himself into ? He did n\'t know , not for sure , but it looked like he was going to find out , for the only answer he could make was the one Leo wanted to hear . " All right , " he said . " We \'ve got a deal . " Delmer used his cell phone to call his home number and left a message on his answering machine , which , he \'d explained to Leo , his coconspirators would also call and use the remote codes to listen for his instructions . Leo was listening over his shoulder , so he said simply , " Hold \' em for a week . If you do n\'t hear from me by then , send \' em . " He was about to hang up when he realized that Leo and his           leave other messages for his imaginary conspirators , so he quickly said the first nonsense word he could think of , as if it was a code : " Glastonbury . " He hung up the phone and turned to Leo . " Okay , " he said . " You \'ve got a week . Let \'s see your wonderful setup . " Delmer \'s first ride in a UFO was everything he had hoped for . They boarded a flying saucer in a field outside of Redmond , and the pilot - an almond-eyed alien with skinny arms and an oversized head - took them for a joyride down the backbone of the Cascade Mountains before lifting off into space . The alien even let Delmer fly the ship for a while , using the amazingly simple controls to zip around the Earth as if the planet were no bigger than an asteroid . " Are n\'t we setting off practically every radar alarm in the world ? " Delmer asked . Leo grinned . " That \'s right . Of course our side knows what \'s causing           a good scare every now and then . Why do n\'t you make another low pass over the Middle East just for the heck of it ? " They soon tired of buzzing humanity and headed for the base on the back side of the Moon . Once they were free of the atmosphere it took just under an hour to travel the quartermillion miles to get there . As Delmer watched the Moon grow steadily larger , he boggled at the degree of technology involved . They were n\'t even wearing seat belts . The moonbase was an architect \'s dream . Low gravity and improbably strong building materials allowed structures to span incredible distances without support . Buildings shaped like palm trees - each frond a separate apartment - filled one crater like an inverted southseas island , while the crater next to it was a webwork of narrow ribbons weaving among angular , crystalline-looking spikes . Real trees grew among the buildings and even on some of them , and Delmer wondered what they did for air until he noticed a shimmering hemisphere over the entire city           They \'d domed in an area at least twenty miles across . Then as they crossed through it and came in for a landing Delmer realized it was wilder than that : the " dome " was just a boundary between air and space . They used nothing so crude as an actual wall to hold in the atmosphere ; rather some kind of force field that allowed spaceships to come and go without hindrance . He presumed the field also kept out cosmic rays and other harmful radiation . They flew straight to Leo \'s house , which was a crystal palace the size of the Taj Mahal . Multisided columns hundreds of feet high stuck out at odd angles from a central core like flowers in a vase . They landed on a plush lawn beside one of the towers , next to half a dozen other UFOs , no two of which were alike . One of them was undoubtedly Leo \'s own private ship : It was a chrome-silver ellipse , almost liquid-looking , like a raindrop caught in motion . It was smaller than the           maybe fifteen wide . The control bubble at the top was swept back , giving the whole thing an impression of speed even standing still . Like a fighter jet parked next to a passenger plane , it screamed out " fast . " " Nice car , " Delmer said as they walked past it toward the palace \'s entrance . He was trying to keep from falling over in the strange , light gravity , and trying not to freak out at the very idea of being in a city on the back side of the moon . " Is n\'t she slick ? " Leo said proudly . " Maybe later we can take her out to Saturn and do some ring racing or something . " " Sure , " Delmer said , thinking , Must be rough living here . His impression did n\'t change when he saw the inside of Leo \'s mansion . It had enough rooms to house a small nation , and the potential to transform into practically any shape Leo wanted . Leo just had to show him the rushes           the fourteenth row of a thirty-row theater in which three-quarters of the seats were occupied by soft , realistic dummies put there so the acoustics would match that of a nearly full theater . Leo took him on a tour of the grounds as well , pointing out all the exotic plants he \'d brought from Earth and a few that had come from farther away . When Delmer grew tired of admiring Leo \'s riches , Leo sent him to bed in his very own penthouse apartment atop a leaning spire about fifty stories high . Delmer spent a restless few hours waiting for the thing to either fall over or launch him to Alpha Centauri , but neither happened so he turned down the windows to simulate night - sunset still being a few days away according to Leo - and slept fitfully until Leo woke him up and took him on a tour of the city . The population seemed to be about half alien . It took Delmer a couple of days to stop flinching whenever he turned a corner and came face-to-face with one of           a few and discovered that they were n\'t interested in doing painful rectal exams on him , he still felt like a cat in a room full of dogs . What were they doing here ? he wondered . And as his stay stretched into the third and fourth days , each one full of wonderful new discoveries , Delmer began to wonder why none of this technology was making it to Earth . He asked Leo about it on the afternoon of his fourth day on the Moon . The Sun was just setting at the end of the city \'s two-week day . Leo and Delmer were watching it from the top of a corkscrewshaped building nearly a mile high . They were still in full sunlight , but the ground below them was already a dark plain glittering with points of light that were hills and crater rims catching the last rays of the sun . Leo considered Delmer \'s question for a minute or so before answering . " Well , we do share some of it . Mostly movie special effects , and some computer           of it eventually , but not just yet . The Vreenish have n\'t finished studying us yet , and they do n\'t want to mess things up before they understand how it works . We ca n\'t just dump new technology and a new way of life on people all at once ; they are n\'t ready for it . Give them all this without preparation and pretty soon Luna will look just like Cleveland rather than the other way around . " " Hmm , " Delmer said . He \'d heard that argument before , as an excuse to keep from helping underdeveloped nations industrialize . He said , " You seem to have adapted pretty well . And the what , half million or so other people here ? They \'ve handled the culture shock without too much trouble , have n\'t they ? " Leo had been leaning out against one of the slanted windows ; he turned his head toward Delmer and said , " Well , yeah , but we \'re a special case . We were ready to accept this . Most of           own creation when we discovered the Vreenish . " " There \'s millions of people out there who already believe in UFOs with practically no evidence at all , " Delmer pointed out . He was standing back from the window ; he could n\'t bring himself to lean out over a mile-high drop with only a pane of glass- even improbably strong glass - between him and the ground . " It \'ll take a lot more than naive credulity to bring humanity up to speed , " Leo said sarcastically . Nave , is it ? Delmer thought . Was it nave to uncover the whole conspiracy simply by piecing together what he read in the papers ? Was it naive to penetrate their cover deeply enough to make them take action against him , even recruit him ? Hah . Leo did n\'t fool him . He and his cronies here on the Moon simply wanted to keep their incredible toys to themselves for as long as possible . Well , if Delmer had anything to say about it , that would n\'t be much longer .           him he wanted to explore on his own for a while . Leo was getting tired of showing him around anyway , so it hardly took any convincing . As soon as he got free , Delmer spent a day doing just what he \'d said he would do : exploring . He found a shopping mall where he bought a portable book reader and electronic copies of half a dozen primers for understanding the Vreenish technology , plus as many other gadgets as he could carry . Universal language translators , indestructible clothing , personal force fields- he felt like Buck Rogers by the time he left the mall . When he got back to his apartment he used his new wrist videophone to call Leo . It was easier than trying to track him down in the sprawling mansion . When Leo \'s holographic head appeared above his hand , he said , " I think it \'s time I went back and defused my answering machine message , do n\'t you ? " Leo laughed . " Funny thing about that . You know , nobody has           himself turning white . He \'d forgotten that one crucial detail in his bluff . " Do n\'t worry , " Leo said . " You \'re already here , and it would be more trouble to take you back than it would be to let you stay . Just keep your nose clean , or we \'ll send you back so fast you \'ll think you were teleported . " " Thanks , " Delmer said sarcastically . " Hey , you \'re a friend , " Leo replied . " I would n\'t do this for just anybody . " No , of course not , thought Delmer . He only did it for people who were a big enough threat to warrant his attention . " You \'re a true pal , " he said , then he switched off the phone , packed his treasures in a bag , and left the penthouse apartment . The parking lawn was still full of flying saucers . Delmer headed straight for the liquid chrome one . Leo had n\'t taken him out in it yet , but from           was pretty sure he did n\'t need a key . He felt a twinge of guilt at stealing what probably amounted to his best friend \'s penile extension , but if he knew Leo , he \'d just use the opportunity to buy an even bigger one with his insurance settlement . Acting nonchalant , as if he were just a parking valet , Delmer walked straight up to the saucer , climbed the ramp that slid out when he approached , and sat in the single pilot \'s chair . The ramp slid up behind him and the door sealed tight . Delmer examined the control board , a tight horseshoe-shaped console wrapping around the chair . The controls were n\'t arranged like the ones in the UFO he \'d flown on the way to the Moon , but they were labeled with little international-style pictures of the ship tilting this way and that , and zooming along with speed lines stretched out behind it . Delmer found the one that looked like the lift button , but nothing happened when he pressed it . Okay , maybe it           might be an ignition switch , but there was n\'t anything obvious . No key slot , which was a good sign , but no prominent red button labeled " on , " either . He tried a few anyway , hoping for luck , but all he got for his effort was a sultry female voice saying , " You forgot your passphrase again , did n\'t you ? " He looked over his shoulder , half expecting to see a real woman standing behind him , but he was alone in the ship . " Uh , no , " he said , wondering frantically what sort of password Leo would use . " Money ? " he said timidly . " Sorry , that was last month , " the voice said . " It \'s a phrase now . " " Oh , of course , " said Delmer . " Uhh , let \'s do lunch ? " " Nope . " " How about Td like to thank my parents , and all the people who- \' " " Sorry . I \'m going           the vehicle . " " No , do n\'t do that ! " Delmer stood up and grabbed his bag . " Just sit tight . Do n\'t go anywhere . I \'ll get right back to you . " " Passphrase accepted , " the voice said . " Have a nice flight . " Delmer collapsed back in the chair and stabbed at the lift button . The glittering spaceship leaped off the ground , narrowly missing an overhanging wing of the mansion , and within seconds it had cleared the air bubble and was hurtling into deep space . Delmer swung around the Moon until he was aimed at the Earth , then held the " speed " button down until he could see the planet visibly growing ahead of him . He looked back to see if he had any pursuit , but the entire Moon was dwindling like an untied balloon . He was twenty-five minutes out-and nearly to Earth - before his wrist phone buzzed for attention . Delmer ignored it , afraid that Leo might be able to control the ship with his           n\'t do it even without the phone , but the ship kept on in its headlong plunge toward the blue and white planet below . The hunt was on , though . As he drew closer to home , Delmer wondered where he ought to take his stolen UFO . It would be indisputable proof of the existence of the Black Space Program , but only if he could get it to the right people before Leo and his cronies caught up with him . None of the government agencies would be any good ; they were already in on it . Except for SED , of course , but Delmer wondered if they had enough clout to blow the conspiracy even with a UFO as evidence . Probably not . To do any good , Delmer was going to have to reach hundreds of thousands of people with his proof , and he was only going to get one shot at it . As soon as he went public , a whole fleet of Vreenish would probably show up to reclaim the ship . Earth was a flat wall           finally identifying the outline of southwestern Africa . That would put America around the curve of the planet to the left , so Delmer angled his descent that way and skipped along just above the atmosphere until he saw the outline of Florida slide toward him . Hmm . Not good . NASA would undoubtedly be looking for him soon , if they were n\'t already . He reached out to change course , but a sudden thought made him pause . NASA could have saucers anywhere in the world in less than ten minutes ; it did n\'t matter if he went to Rorida or anywhere else . Except Florida was where the National Revealer was published . The newspaper of the conspiracy set . Hundreds of thousands of people read it every week and believed every word . Delmer smiled as he slowed the UFO down and brought it in toward the Miami coast . Everything was going to work out fine . He \'d be famous , a national hero . Maybe he \'d even get to meet Elvis . \n CHARACTERS ( main characters in boldface ) Narrators 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Cassie Logan , 9-year-old black girl living in Mississippi Stacey Logan , Cassie \'s 12-year-old brother T.J.

Cassie Logan : Little Man , would you come on ? You \'re gon na make us late . Narrator 2 : He lags behind his brothers and sister because , to take each step , he lifts his leg high and then gingerly places it down in the dust . Six-year-old Little Man hates to get dirty , especially because this is his first day of school . The other Logan children are           us late and Mama \'s gon na wear you out . Stacey Logan : Hush up , Cassie . Narrator 3 : Stacey is in a foul mood this morning . First , there \'s the deep heat beating down on the children in their uncomfortable Sunday clothes . But Stacey is extra irritable because today he is starting the seventh grade - the grade taught by their mama . Narrator 4 : The narrow , sunsplotched road winds before the Logans like a lazy red serpent . A barbed wire fence runs the length of the deep fields . The fence stretches east until it meets a green pasture that signals the end of the Logan family \'s 400-acre property . Narr 1 : Beyond their land is a forest . Past that are acres of vast farming fields worked by sharecropping* families . All that land was once a 10-square-mile plantation owned by Harlan Granger . Narr 2 : The Logans \' land had once been Granger \'s land too . But the Grangers sold it during Reconstruction. + The Logans are the only black family in the           , emaciated boy pops out of the forest and swings his arm around Stacey . T.J.

Had her last year . She failed me . Now I got her again . Stacey : Shoot ! Least you do n\'t have to spend all day in a classroom with your mama . T.J. : Look on the bright side . Think of the advantage you \'ve got . You \'ll be learnin \' all sorts of stuff \' fore the rest of us ... like what \'s on them tests . Stacey : If that \'s what you think , then you do n\'t know Mama . T.J. : No need getting mad . Just an idea . Narr 4 : Cassie gives T.J. a nasty look . She has never trusted him . Christopher-John Logan : Quick ! Off the road ! Narr 1 : Without another           the forest . Little Man does not go . Stacey : Get up here , Little Man ! Come on , do like I say ! Little Man Logan : But I \'ll get my clothes dirty . Christopher-John : You \'re gon na get a whole lot dirtier down there . Look ! Narr 2 : Little Man turns around as a school bus bears down on him . It is spewing clouds of red dust like a huge , yellow firebreathing dragon . Narr 3 : Little Man runs frantically along the road looking for a foothold , but he does n\'t find one before the bus speeds past him . The driver intentionally covers him in a scarlet haze while white laughing faces press against the bus windows . T.J. : laughing ) Well , old Little Man done got his Sunday clothes dirty . Stacey : Aw , hush up , TJ . Cassie : Yeah , hush up , TJ . Narr 4 : The kids climb back down to the road , where Little Man is fighting back tears . Little Man : How           they like to see us run , and it ai n\'t our bus . Little Man : Where \'s our bus ? Stacey : We ai n\'t got one . Little Man : Why not ? Stacey : Ask Mama when we get to school . Now let \'s go . SCENE 2 Narr 1 : After school , the family members pick cotton in their field . Cassie has shimmied up a thin wooden pole to reach a puff at the top of a tall stalk . Big Ma : Cassie , you better watch yourself , girl . Sho \' better not fall . Cassie : I \'m not gon na fall , Big Ma . Narr 2 : Cassie scoots up the pole to see over the field to the road , where two male figures walk briskly toward them . One is much taller than the other . Cassie recognizes the familiar , fluid gait of the shorter one . Narr 3 : She slides down the pole , landing with a thud , and then scrambles to the road . Cassie : Papa ! Papa           her with delight . Big Ma : Do n\'t go through that fence ! Narr 1 : The children ignore her . They carefully pick their way through the row of barbed wire and run swiftly into the road to their father \'s open arms . Little Man : Papa , what are you doing home ? Papa : Just came home to see \' bout my babies . Just look at y\'all . Mr. Morrison , what you think about these children of mine ? Narr 2 : Mr. Morrison is a human tree , towering high above their papa \'s 6-foot-2-inch frame . His body bulges with muscles , and his skin is the deepest ebony and scarred as if by fire . Papa : Children , meet Mr. L.T. Morrison . Narr 3 : As the children stammer their helios , Mama and Big Ma approach . Mama : David , is something the matter ? Papa : Something got ta be wrong for me to come see you ? Narr 4 : Together , they make their way into the house , where Mr. Morrison surveys           na be home , David ? Papa : Till Sunday evening . Mama : Sunday ? Why , today \'s already Saturday . Papa : I know , baby , but I ca n\'t be taking extra time away from the rail . Listen , I come home special so I could bring Mr. Morrison . He lost his job on the railroad a while back . He ca n\'t find anything else . I asked him whether he wanted to work here as a hired hand for a while . We ca n\'t afford him much , but we can give him food and shelter and maybe a little cash when I come home again in the winter . Mama : All right . Welcome to our home , Mr. Morrison . Papa : I think things being what they are , happening like they did with the Berrys , I \'d feel good knowing there \'s a man around here till I get home . Cassie : Papa , what about the Berrys ? Mama : Never you mind , child . Christopher-John : But , Mama ...           I said never mind . Go on now , and get ready for supper . SCENE 3 Narr 1 : The next morning , at the church social , Cassie hears the story about the Berrys from their neighbor Mrs. Lanier when she whispers it to Big Ma . Narr 2 : She hears that one of the Berry boys died last night from his burns . His brother and father are alive , but barely . Narr 3 : Rumor has it that some white men attacked the Berry men . The white men dragged them from their house , dumped kerosene on them , and set them aflame . All because they thought John Henry was flirting with a white woman . Narr 4 : The worst part , Mrs. Lanier says , is that everyone knows it was the owners of a local shop , the Wallace brothers , who did it . People have even heard them bragging about it . But no one from the black community dares to accuse them . Cassie pretends she is n\'t listening , but the disturbing news leaves her           an announcement at the supper table . Papa : In this house , we do n\'t shop at the Wallaces \' store . Children from our neighborhood go up there to drink liquor and smoke . Things children should never be doing . That place is nothing but trouble , and I do n\'t want to see any of you up at that store , you hear ? Cassie , Stacey , Christopher-John , and Little Man : Yes , Pa . Narr 2 : Papa does n\'t mention the incident Cassie overheard that morning . Cassie knows better than to bring it up . SCENE 4 Narr 3 : November is a rainy month , which makes the children \'s hour-long walk to school even more dreadful . Narr 4 : Worse still is that bus driver . He loves to entertain his passengers by sending the black children slipping up the washed-out bank , before splashing them head to toe in mud . Every morning is a cruel , humiliating experience . Narr1 : On this November morning , the Logans cross their school lawn , covered up           bus incident . Stacey : whispering to the others ) Meet me at the toolshed at noon . Cassie : Why ? Stacey : 111 show y\'all how we \'re gon na stop that bus from splashing us . Narr 2 : At lunch , Cassie and her brothers meet as planned by the toolshed . They duck into the shed , and Stacey hands them shovels and buckets . Then he guides them out around the back of the school buildings and into the road . Stacey : Come on , let \'s run . We do n\'t have much time . Christopher-John : Where we going ? Stacey : Up to where that bus forced us off the road this morning . Be careful now . ... All right , here we are . Start digging . Cassie , you dig over there on that side of the road . Do n\'t get too near the edge . It has to look like it \'s been washed out . I \'ll start on this end . ChristopherJohn , Little Man , start scooping out from the middle .           on time . Narr 3 : They ask no more questions . Once the trench is deep enough , they begin carting buckets of water from the gullies and dumping them in until it looks as level as the road . Christopher-John : Looks like it \'s gon na rain real hard this afternoon . Narr 4 : The Logans gather their tools and hurry back to school . Narri : After school , the children meet again for their long walk home . This time , they feel a nervous excitement in their hearts . Stacey : Let \'s walk the whole way through the forest . I do n\'t want to be anywhere in sight when that bus crashes . Christopher-John : Stacey , what if they find out we done it ? Stacey : Do n\'t worry , they wo n\'t . Little Man : Hey , I think it \'s coming . Narr 2 : The Logans flatten themselves completely under the bushes and watch the bus as it speeds into the puddle . It emits a tremendous thump and careens into their trap . The           : The Logans cover their mouths and shake with laughter as the students try to jump over the trench , misjudge it , and fall in . The driver swears and kicks the submerged front tire . Narr 4 : The Logans continue home , giggling and celebrating their sweet revenge . SCENE 5 Narr 1 : Several days later , T.J. and Stacey get into a fight . T.J. tells on Stacey for cheating on a test , and Mama punishes Stacey in front of the whole class . Narr 2 : After school , Stacey follows T.J. to the Wallaces \' store to confront him . Cassie and her brothers tag along , knowing they should not be there . Narr 3 : Outside the store , Stacey pounces on T. J. , knocking him to the ground . They begin to roll around , fists flying . T.J. : Hey , man , wait a minute . Let me explain . Ai n\'t my fault , Stacey . Stacey : Shut up ! Narr 4 : The boys continue fighting , and the Wallaces , the white           . Everyone is so engrossed in the fight that none of them see a mule wagon pull up and Mr. Morrison get out of it . All of the sudden , the fighting stops and there is silence . Mr. Morrison : Stacey , you and your sister and brothers get in the wagon now . Christopher-John : Oh , we gon na get it now . I told y\'all we should have gone home . Narr 1 : The kids quietly pile into the wagon . Stacey : You gon na tell Mama we was here , Mr. Morrison ? Mr. Morrison : No . You are . Narr 2 : The children gasp . Mr. Morrison : I wo n\'t tell your mama . It seems you feel you got a good reason to be up here , but I know you should n\'t be . Y\'all owe it to her to tell her . Narr 3 : Christopher- John and Little Man protest . Cassie looks incredulously at Mr. Morrison . Stacey : All right , I \'ll tell her . Christopher-John : No , Stacey ,           you ! Narr 4 : That night , Stacey explains everything to their mother . He does not tell her that his sister and brothers were there too . Mama : I suppose you three went along with him ? That does it ! Narr 1 : The children expect Mama to punish them , but instead she paces the floor angrily before sending them all to bed . The kids think they have gotten off a little easy . SCENE 6 Narr 2 : On Saturday morning , Mama wakes the children at the crack of dawn . She dresses them quickly and piles them into the wagon . Mama : Listen , children , where we \'re going , the man is very sick , and he does n\'t look like other people . But I do n\'t want you to be afraid or uncomfortable around him . Just be yourselves . Narr 3 : They ride for almost two hours before arriving at the Berrys \' home . Mama knocks , but no one answers . She cracks open the door . Mama : Good morning ,           elderly woman waddles up to the door . Mrs. Berry smiles wide and throws her good arm around Mama . Mrs. Berry : Land sakes , child ! Ai n\'t you something ! These your babies ? Ai n\'t they fine ! Come on in , y\'all . Narri : The children follow Mrs. Berry into the dark house . Mrs. Berry : I got to cover him up . Do n\'t want to scare y\'all . He ca n\'t speak no more - fire burned him too bad . But he understands all right . Narr 2 : Mrs. Berry lights a few lanterns . The light illuminates a still form with glittering eyes . The face has no nose , and the head no hair ; the skin is scarred and burned , and the lips are wizened like charcoal . A wheezing sound echoes from an opening at the mouth . Mama : Say good morning to Mrs. Berry \'s husband , children . Narr 3 : The children stammer their good-mornings and try not to stare as Mama softly talks to the Berrys . She tells           as normal as anybody else . After an hour , they say their good-byes and get back in the wagon . Mama : The Wallaces did that , children . They poured kerosene over Mr. Berry and his sons and lit them on fire . One of the sons died . The other is just like Mr. Berry . And everyone knows about it , and nothing was ever done .

Her excitement almost makes it easy to forget that T.J. is going along too . Big Ma : Well , children , open your eyes and take in Strawberry , Mississippi ! Cassie : This is it ? Shoot !

We can save her some time , so when she comes from seein \' that lawyer , we can just go home . Besides , I got somethin \' to show ya . Stacey : Well , I guess it will be all right .

Stacey : Come on           On the way out , Cassie sees Mr. Barnett wrapping an order of pork chops for a white girl no older than herself . Cassie : Excuse me , Mr. Barnett . I think you forgot , but you were waiting on us before this girl here . Mr. Barnett : Well , you just get your little black self back over there and wait some more . Cassie : We been waiting for you for almost an hour , while you go around waitin \' on everybody else . It \'s not fair . You got no right Narr 1 : Then Mr. Barnett bellows a nasty name at Cassie . Cassie yells back that she wo n\'t be called that . Stacey whispers for her to hush up . Cassie : Stacey ! Tell him this ai n\'t fair ! Mr. Barnett : She \'s your sister , boy ? Stacey : Yessir .

Narr 2 : Stacey jerks Cassie by the arm and drags her outside the store . Cassie : What \'s wrong with you ? You know he was wrong ! Stacey : I know it and you know it , but he does n\'t know it .

SCENE 9 Narr 4 : Papa comes home for Christmas and the rest of the winter . Early one morning , Cassie overhears a conversation about the boycott of the Wallaces \' store . Mama : Everybody from here to Strawberry knows it was them . But what do we do about it ? We line their pockets with our few pennies and send our children up to their store to learn bad things . The least we can do is stop shopping there . Mr. Turner and the Laniers and the Averys and more than two dozen other families , they all say they \'ll think           Papa : Mary we go backing folks \' credit with our land , we \'d lose it for sure . Big Ma : What if I told you I spoke with Mr. Jamison about this ? What if I told you he agreed to back the credit of those families if they shop at the Vicksburg store ? Papa : Harlan Granger and the Wallaces are n\'t going to like this . Boycotting this store points a finger right at them for what they \'ve done . Mama : Well , that \'s just too bad for Harlan Granger and the Wallaces . I know there is some risk here , but we ca n\'t let things like this go by unnoticed . We best go tell everybody the news and get ourselves ready for a big trip up to Vicksburg . Narr 1 : The boycott begins . Several families suddenly stop shopping at the Wallaces \' store .

Cassie : Mama , they all right , ai n\'t they ? Mama : \' Course they are . They \'re just late , is all . Cassie : You do n\'t think somebody done ... Mama : Maybe you children better go to bed .

Narr 4 : Mama hears the dogs barking and opens the front door , yelling into the night . Mama : David ! Mr. Morrison : Go on , Stacey . I got him . Narr 1 : Stacey comes into sight out the window , followed by Mr. Morrison , who is carrying Papa . Narr 2 : Papa \'s left leg sticks straight out , immobilized by a shotgun that is tied to it with rope . His head is wrapped with a blood-stained rag . Mr. Morrison : Leg broke . Wagon rolled over it . We better get it set . Did n\'t have time to do it on the way . Mama : But his head ! You all right , Stacey ? Stacey : Yes \'m . Mama : Then go get out of those wet clothes . Narr 3 : By now , all the children have come out           all back to bed . Cassie : What happened ? Stacey : I du n no . His leg is busted up by the wagon . . . and he \'s shot .

You tell us what happened . Stacey : We was coming back from Vicksburg when the back wheels come off . Papa and Mr. Morrison , they think somebody messed with them wheels for them both to come off the way they did . Papa thought somebody was coming after us . So Papa told me to hold the reins on Jack real tight while he changed the wheels . But Jack was skittish because of the storm . Mr. Morrison held the whole wagon up by himself , and Papa put the first wheel on . That \'s when he got shot . Cassie : Who done it ? Stacey : A truck come up the           get the wheel on . The noise from the shot scared Jack - I could n\'t hold him - so he reared up , and then the wagon fell on Papa \'s leg . Cassie : Oh no ! Stacey : It \'s my fault his leg is busted . Mr. Morrison fought the other men like crazy . He picked one of them up and threw him on the ground like he did n\'t weight a thing . Then the men got in the truck and left . Little Man : Then what ? Stacey : Nothin \' . Then we put on the other wheel and come on home . Cassie : Who was it ? Stacey : The Wallaces , I think . Christopher-John : Stacey , is Papa gon na die ? Stacey : No , he \'s just sleeping right now . Christopher-John : Well , when \'s he gon na wake up ? Stacey : In the morning . You just wait and see . He \'ll be just fine come morning . Scene 11 Narr 4 : Stacey \'s promise comes true ,           his recovery is slow . Narr 1 : In August , the Logan family goes to their church \'s annual revival . The Logans have a lot to pray for . Narr 2 : T.J. shows up with two white teenagers . Ever since Stacey stopped talking to him , T.J. has been seen hanging around with the delinquent boys . Narr 3 : It was even rumored that he and the boys were stealing from people in the community . Everybody knew it meant trouble . But nobody expected T.J. to bring his new friends to a black church revival . T.J. : Well , well , well ! What we got here ? Y\'all gon na welcome us to your revival services ? Stacey : What are you doing here , T.J. ? T.J. : I got a right to come to my own church , do n\'t I ? See all my old friends ? Hey , Cassie , how you doing ? Narr 4 : T.J reaches out to Cassie \'s cheek , and she slaps his hand away . T.J. : Well , this is           here to introduce you to my new friends , Melvin and R. W , and you act like you got no manners at all . These new friends of mine have been mighty good to me . Give me new clothes and stuff . I \'m their best friend . Ai n\'t that right , fellas ? Narr 1 : The two boys smile condescendingly at T.J. The Logans are unimpressed . Stacey : Come on , everyone . Service is about to start . Narr 2 : The others turn to go . T.J. : Hey , what \'s the matter with y\'all ? Melvin : All right , T.J. We came down here like you asked . Now it \'s time for you to come with us . R.W. : Yeah , T.J. , you still want that pearl-handled pistol , do n\'t you ? SCENE 12 Narr 3 : On the porch , Mr. Morrison sings into the hot , muggy August night .

T.J. : Keep it down , Cassie . I got ta talk to Stacey . Narr 1 : TJ. slips through the door . He rushes into the boys \' bedroom . Cassie follows . T.J. : I \'m in trouble , Stacey . I mean I \'m really in trouble . Cassie : That ai n\'t nothing new . Stacey : What did you come here for ? Go get your white friends to bail you out of it . T.J. : They \'re the ones who got me in it . They hurt me bad . Narr 2 : TJ. unbuttons his           swollen a deep blueblack . Cassie gasps . T.J. : Help me . Take me home . I ca n\'t get there by myself . Stacey : How come they did this to you ? T.J. : Because I said I was gon na tell what happened . Said if I tell , they \'ll do worse than this . Stacey : What happened ? Narr 3 : T.J. says that after they left the church , Melvin and R. W took him to Strawberry to get the pistol . They broke into the store to get it . When Mr. Barnett came downstairs , one of the boys hit him over the head with an ax . T.J. : I did n\'t do it ! I went in to that store with them , but I did n\'t think we was going to steal nothin \' . And I sure did n\'t plan on them killing somebody . I told them to take me home right away or I would tell . That was when they beat me . Narr 4 : When T.J. woke up , he was           hall where RW and Melvin played . T.J. : I want to go home , but I came here instead because I knew they would n\'t come looking for me here . Stacey : Was Mr. Barnett really dead ? T.J. : I du n no . He sure looked dead . Stacey , you know what they gon na do to me when they find out ? You got to help me get home . Stacey : You sure you ai n\'t lying ? T.J. : I ai n\'t lying . Everything I told you is the truth . I admit I \'ve lied to you before , but I ai n\'t lying now . Narr 1 : Stacey and Cassie agree to set out for the Averys \' house . SCENE 13 Narr 2 : The children sneak T.J. to his home without a problem . But , as soon as T.J. makes it inside his house , a caravan of headlights flood up the driveway . The Wallaces and other men fly out of their cars and up to the house . Narr 3 : Cassie and           : rail get outta that house . You murdering thieves ! Narr 4 : RW and Melvin get out of their truck too . They smash open a window of the Averys \' house and break down a door . Soon , the Avery family is dragged out of their home , screaming and crying . Mr. Wallace : Look what we got here ! This that pearl-handled pistol from Mr. Barnett \'s store . Narr 1 : He holds the gun high in the air and turns to R. W and Melvin . Mr. Wallace : These two boys seen you run out of that store , boy . I got me a good new rope . You about to break it in for me . Narr 2 : The other men cheer and hiss foul names at the Averys . Stacey and Cassie stand by . Stacey : Cassie , get home now . Get Papa and Mr. Morrison . Go ! Narr 3 : Cassie flies home , where her family is waiting for her . She tells them the entire story . Papa : And Stacey           \'s hid in the forest . They do n\'t know he \'s there . Papa : Got ta get him out of there . Narr 4 : Papa springs into action despite his bad leg . Mama : David , not with the shotgun . You ca n\'t stop them like that . Papa : Got no other way . Mama : You fire , and they \'ll hang you for sure . Papa : If I do n\'t , they \'ll hang T.J. This thing \'s been coming a long time . T.J. just happened to be the one foolish enough to trigger it . But I ca n\'t just sit by and let them kill the boy . Mama : David , do n\'t you use that gun . Papa : Perhaps . . . Narr 1 : Papa touches Mama \'s face and disappears with Mr. Morrison into the night . SCENE 14 Narr 2 : Mama and Big Ma shake and pace the house until suddenly Mama stiffens and sniffs at the air . Mama : You smell smoke ? Cassie : Mama , the cotton           Oh , good lord ! Lightning done that tonight ! Mama : If it reaches those trees , it \'ll burn everything from here to Strawberry . Wo n\'t no one be able to put it out . Narr 3 : Mama leaves the room and returns with sacks of burlap . She dumps the sacks into a washbasin of water . She demands that the children stay in the house while she and Big Ma go fight the fire . Narr 4 : Hours pass , and it begins to rain . Finally , Cassie decides to go out and survey the destruction . The fire is mostly out , but she finds people swatting patches . Narr 1 : All of the town , white and black people , dump shovels of dirt on the small patches of fire . Mr. Granger and Mr. Morrison work side by side , seemingly oblivious to each other . Narr 2 : Cassie sees Mama and Big Ma heading back toward the house with Stacey . She runs home . Mama : My babies ! Christopher-John : Stacey , are you           Man : Ai n\'t Papa and Mr. Morrison coming ? Mama : They \'ll be coming soon . Cassie : But Mama , what about T.J. ? Mama : T.J. \'s all right . The sheriff and Mr. Jamison took him into Strawberry . Little Man : He done something bad , Mama ? Mama : They think he did , baby . They think he did . Cassie : But those men did n\'t hurt him no more ? Mama : They stopped it . They had to stop to go fight that fire . Otherwise , it would have burned every one of them up . Cassie : And Papa and Mr. Morrison ? They did n\'t have to use guns , did they ? Stacey : That fire came up , and Mr. Morrison came and got me . Cassie : He came to get you by himself ? Where was Papa ? Stacey : Vali know he could n\'t make it up the slope with that leg . Narr 3 : Cassie had seen her father move on that leg . He could have made it           something she did n\'t quite understand . Mama : Looks like about a quarter of our cotton field was burned . Stacey : Folks thinking that lightning struck our fence and started that fire . Mama : David better stay out of town for a while till all this blows over . Narr 4 : Suddenly , Cassie realizes one of those things that is known , but never said . Cassie : to herself ) That \'s why Mr. Morrison went alone to get Stacey . That \'s why the fire started when it did ! Papa started the fire . Narr 1 : It wiped out a quarter of their stock , but it stopped the men from torturing TJ . Narr 2 : She looks at her father , who is walking toward the house , with a mix of pride and confusion . Cassie : What \'s gon na happen to TJ. now ? Narr 3 : Mama and Papa shake their heads . Although it is near dawn , the Logans finally settle down to rest . Narr 4 : In bed , Cassie sobs           will be the same . She will still run through the woods and swim in the pond and go to school . But that \'s all over for TJ . Cassie is safe in her home , but she cries for the land . \n STEFFISBURG , SWITZERLAND , 1901 Marta usually loved Sundays . It was the only day Papa closed the tailor shop and Mama had a rest . The family dressed in their finest clothes and walked to church , Papa and Mama ahead , Marta \'s older brother , Hermann , behind them , and Marta and her younger sister , Elise , bringing up the rear . Usually other families joined them along the way . Marta would watch eagerly for her best friend , Rosie Gilgan , who \'d run down the hill to join her and walk the rest of the way to the old Romanesque church with its arches mortared shut and the white clock tower . Today , Marta hung her head , wishing she could run away and hide among the pines and alders while the townsfolk gathered for services . She could sit on her favorite fallen tree and ask God why Papa despised her so much and seemed so set on making her suffer . Today , she would n\'t have complained if Papa had told her to stay home and work in the shop alone and not step foot outside the           than that for the bruises to fade . Despite evidence of the beating he had given her , Papa insisted everyone attend services . She wore a knitted cap and kept her chin down , hoping no one would notice . It was n\'t the first time she had borne the marks of his anger . When people came close , Marta shifted the woolen scarf or turned her face away . When they came into the churchyard , Papa sent Mama ahead with Elise and Hermann . He caught Marta by the elbow and spoke into her ear . " You \'ll sit in back . " " People will want to know why . " " And I \'ll tell them the truth . You \'re being punished for defying me . " His fingers dug in painfully , but she refused to utter a sound of pain . " Keep your head down . No one wants to see your ugly face . " He let go of her and went inside . Fighting tears , Marta went in alone and stepped into the last row of           When he glanced back , she tucked her chin quickly , looking up again only after he had seated himself . Her sister , Elise , looked back over her shoulder , face far too pale and strained for a child . Mama leaned close , whispering , and Elise turned face-forward again . Hermann sat between Mama and Papa , his head turning to the right and left . No doubt he was looking for friends and would disappear as soon as the services ended . Rosie passed by and sat near the front . The Gilgans had eight children and took up an entire row . Rosie glanced toward Marta \'s mother and father , then back . Marta hid behind Herr Becker , sitting in front of her . She waited briefly and peered around the baker again . All the murmuring stopped when the minister stepped into the pulpit . He opened the service with prayer . Joining with the congregation , Marta said the prayer of confession , and she heard the minister \'s assurance of God \'s mercy and forgiveness . As the creed           like the snow blowing across the Alpine meadows above Steffisburg . She imagined herself spreading her arms like wings and letting the white swirling flakes lift and carry her wherever God willed . And where would that be ? she wondered . The minister \'s voice rose as he preached . He always said the same thing , but used different words , different examples from the Bible . " Strive harder . Faith is dead without good works . Do not become complacent . Those who turn their backs on God are destined for hell . " Was God like Papa , never satisfied no matter how hard she tried ? Papa believed in God , but when had he ever shown her mercy ? And if he believed God created everyone , then what right had Papa to complain over how tall she was , how thin , how white her skin , how large her hands and feet ? Her father cursed her because she passed the school examinations " and made Hermann look a fool ! " She \'d tried to defend herself . She should           . He \'d rather hike in the hills than do his studies . " Papa came after her . Mama tried to get between , but he shoved her roughly aside . " You think you can talk to me like that and get away with it ? " Marta raised her arm to protect herself , but it did no good . " Johann , do n\'t ! " Mama cried out . Still gripping Marta \'s arm , he turned on Mama . " Do n\'t you tell me- " " How many times must we turn the other cheek , Papa ? " Something white-hot rose up inside Marta when he threatened Mama . That \'s when he used his fist on her . He let go of her abruptly and stood over her . " She made me do it . You heard her ! A father ca n\'t tolerate insolence in his own home ! " Marta did n\'t know she \'d fainted until Mama stroked the hair back from her face . " Be still , Marta . Elise is getting a wet cloth           \'s gone to the tanner . He wo n\'t be back for a while . " Mama took the cloth Elise held out . Marta sucked in her breath when Mama dabbed her split lip . " You should n\'t provoke your father . " " So it \'s my fault . " " I did n\'t say that . " " I pass the examination with the highest marks in school and get a beating for it . Where \'s Hermann ? Strolling along on some mountain trail ? " Mama cupped her cheek . " You must forgive your father . He lost his temper . He did n\'t know what he was doing . " Mama always made excuses for him , just as Papa made excuses for Hermann . No one made excuses for her . " Forgive , " Mama said . " Seventy times seven . Forgive ! " Marta \'s mouth twisted as the minister spoke of God the Father . She wished God was like Mama instead . When the service ended , Marta waited until Papa motioned her to join the           Elise . " Johann Schneider ! " Papa turned at Herr Gilgan \'s voice . The two men shook hands and talked . Hermann took advantage of the distraction to join some friends heading up the hill . Mama took Elise \'s hand when Frau Gilgan joined them . " Where have you been all week ? " Rosie spoke softly and Marta turned . Rosie gasped softly . " Oh , Marta . " She moaned in sympathy . " Again ? What was his reason this time ? " " School . " " But you passed the examination ! " " Hermann did n\'t . " " But that \'s not fair . " Marta lifted one shoulder and gave Rosie a bleak smile . " It does no good to tell him so . " Rosie would never be able to understand . Her father adored her . Herr Gilgan adored all his children . They all worked together in the running of Hotel Edelweiss , encouraging one another in everything . They teased one another with good-natured humor , but never mocked or belittled anyone           others lovingly closed ranks around him and helped . Sometimes Marta envied her friend . Every member of the Gilgan family would finish school . The boys would serve their two years in the Swiss Army and then go off to university in Bern or Zurich . Rosie and her sisters would learn fine cuisine and the art of running a large household that embraced up to thirty outsiders . She would be tutored in French , English , and Italian . If Rosie had further aspirations , her father would n\'t deny her simply because she was a girl . He would send her to university along with her brothers . " You \'ve been in school long enough , " Papa had declared when he came back from the tanner . " You \'re old enough to carry your share of the financial burden . " Begging him for one more year of school had done no good at all . Tears filled Marta \'s eyes . " Papa said it \'s enough that I can read , write , and do arithmetic . " " But you           should make it to the university , it would be you . " " There will be no university for me . Papa said I \'m done with school . " " But why ? " " Papa says too much school fills a girl \'s head with nonsense . " By nonsense Papa meant ambition . Marta burned with it . Marta had hoped that with enough schooling , she would have choices about what to do with her life . Papa said school had puffed her up and she needed to be brought down to where she belonged . Rosie took Marta \'s hand . " Maybe he \'ll change his mind and let you come back to school . I \'m sure Herr Scholz will want to talk to him about it . " Herr Scholz might try , but her father would n\'t listen . Once he made up his mind , not even an avalanche would change it . " It \'ll do no good , Rosie . " " What will you do now ? " " Papa plans to hire me out .           bellowing voice . Scowling , he motioned sharply for her to come . Rosie did n\'t let go of her hand as they joined their families . Frau Gilgan stared at Marta . " What happened to your face ? " She cast an angry look at Papa . Papa stared back at her . " She fell down the stairs . " Papa gave Marta a look of warning . " She \'s always been clumsy . Just look at those big hands and feet . " Frau Gilgan \'s dark eyes snapped . " She \'ll grow into them . " Her husband put his hand beneath her elbow . Mama held out her hand to Marta . " Come along . Elise is cold . We need to go home . " Elise huddled close to Mama \'s side , not looking at anyone . Rosie hugged Marta and whispered , " I \'ll ask Papa to hire you ! " Marta did n\'t dare hope her father would agree-he knew how much she would enjoy working for the Gilgans . Papa went out that afternoon and           He smelled of beer and seemed quite pleased with himself . " Marta ! " He slapped his hand on the table . " I have found work for you . " She would work for the Beckers at the bakery every morning . " You must be there by four in the morning . " She would spend three afternoons a week working for the Zimmers . The doctor thought his wife would welcome some freedom from tending their fractious new baby . " And Frau Fuchs says she can use you to tend her hives . It \'s getting colder , and she \'ll be ready to harvest the honey soon . You \'ll work nights as long as she needs you . " He leaned back in his chair . " And you \'ll work at Hotel Edelweiss two days a week . " He watched her face closely . " Do n\'t think you \'re going to have tea and cookies with your little friend anymore . You \'re there to work . Do you understand ? " " Yes , Papa . " Marta clasped           show her pleasure . " And do n\'t ask for anything . Not from any of them . Herr Becker will pay in bread , Frau Fuchs in honey when the time comes . As to the others , they will settle with me and not you . " Heat spread through Marta \'s limbs , surging up her neck into her cheeks and burning there like lava beneath pale earth . " Am I to receive nothing , Papa ? nothing at all ? " " You receive a roof over your head and food on your plate . You receive clothes on your back . As long as you live in my house , whatever you make rightfully belongs to me . " He turned his head away . " Anna ! " he shouted at Mama . " Are you done with that dress for Frau Keller yet ? " " I \'m working on it now , Johann . " Scowling , Papa shouted again . " She expects delivery by the end of the week ! If you do n\'t have it ready by then           " Papa jerked his head . " Go help your mother . " Marta joined Mama by the fire . She had a box of colored threads on the table at her side and black wool partially embroidered spread across her lap . She coughed violently into a cloth , folded and tucked it in her apron pocket before taking up her sewing again . Anyone could see by her pallor and the dark circles under her eyes that Mama was n\'t well again . Mama had weak lungs . Tonight , her lips had a faint bluish tint . " Help your sister , Marta . She \'s developing another headache . " Elise had spent all evening on her sampler , brow furrowed over every stitch in pained concentration . Marta had helped her until Papa returned . About the only thing Elise could do well was hem , leaving Mama and Marta to do the fine embroidery work . Elise struggled as much as Hermann in school , though not for the same reasons . At ten , Elise could barely read and write . However ,           of her rare and delicate beauty . Mama \'s greatest pleasure took place every morning when she brushed and braided Elise \'s waist-length white-blonde hair . She had flawless alabaster skin and wide , angelic blue eyes . Papa asked nothing of her , taking pride in her beauty , acting sometimes as though he owned a priceless piece of art . Marta worried about her sister . Papa might be right about suitors , but he did n\'t understand Elise \'s deep-seated fears . She had an almost-desperate dependence upon Mama and became hysterical when Papa went into one of his rages , though never in Elise \'s life had a hand been laid on her in anger . Papa would have an eye out for a settled man with money and position for Elise . Marta prayed nightly that God would bless her sister with a husband who would cherish and protect her-and be rich enough to hire others to cook , clean , and raise the children ! Elise would never be able to carry out such responsibilities . Marta lifted a stool and set it beside           things done yesterday . " " She \'s a good customer . " Mama laid a section of skirt carefully over Marta \'s lap so they could work on it together . " Good is not a word I would use , Mama . The woman is a tyrant . " " It \'s not wrong to know what you want . " " If you \'re willing to pay for it . " Marta fumed . Yes , Papa would ask Frau Keller to pay for the additional work , but Frau Keller would refuse . If Papa pressed , Frau Keller would become indignant " at such treatment " and threaten to take her business " to someone more appreciative of my generosity . " She would remind Papa that she ordered six dresses a year , and he should be thankful for her business in these hard times . Papa would apologize profusely , then add what he could to the amount Herr Keller owed for the suits Papa made him . And Papa often had to wait six months for even partial payment . No wonder           like lichen to rock . " If I were Papa , I \'d demand a portion of the money before beginning the work , and full payment before any garment left the shop . " Mama laughed softly . " So much fire from a twelve-year-old girl . " Marta wondered how Mama would ever finish the skirt on time . She threaded a needle with pink silk and set to work on flower petals . " Papa has hired me out , Mama . " Mama sighed . " I know , Liebling . " She quickly drew the cloth from her apron pocket to cover her mouth . When the spasm passed , she fought for breath as she pushed the cloth back into its hiding place . " Your cough is getting worse . " " I know . It comes from the years I worked in the cigar factory . It \'ll get better when summer comes . " In summer , Mama could sit outside and work instead of sitting by a smoking fire . " It never goes away completely , Mama . You           for Frau Zimmer , she might speak with the doctor about what could be done to help Mama . " Let \'s not worry about that now . Frau Keller must have her dress ! " * * * Marta quickly became used to her work schedule . She got up while it was still dark , dressed quickly , and went up the street to the bakery . When Frau Becker let her in the front door , the room smelled of fresh baking bread . Marta went into the kitchen and chopped nuts for Nusstorten while Frau Becker stirred batter for Schokoladenkuchen . " We \'re making Magenbrot today , " Herr Becker announced as he stretched out a long snake of dough and cut it into small pieces . " Marta , dip those in butter and roll them in cinnamon and raisins , and then arrange them in the angel cake tins . " Marta worked quickly , aware that both of the Beckers watched her . Frau Becker poured the dark batter into cake forms and handed the wooden spoon to Marta . " Go           . " Ah , see how the girl can smile , Fanny . " He punched dough down . " You learn quickly , Marta . " He winked at his wife . " We \'ll have to teach her how to make Epiphany cakes this coming Christmas . Ja ? " " And Lebkuchen . " Frau Becker winked at Marta . Mama loved the spicy gingerbread . " And Marzipan . " Frau Becker took the spoon and tossed it into the sink . " I \'ll teach you how to make Butterpltzchen . " She set butter , flour , and sugar on the worktable . " And tomorrow , I \'ll teach you how to make anise cookies . " ( Continues ... ) Excerpted from Her Mother \'s Hope by FRANCINE RIVERS Copyright 2010 by Francine Rivers . \n Liza Burgess Since it was New Year \'s and I wanted to look especially nice , I tried on all my jewelry before finally deciding to wear my new necklace to dinner with Garrett . I make a lot of jewelry , but this was my best piece yet : five individual strands of slender silver beads that I \'d joined into one necklace , twisting the strands together so they \'d catch the light and make a statement . It would be perfect with the deep V-neck of the dress I planned on wearing . But when I was trying it on , I realized that the clasp was too flimsy for such a heavy necklace . So I put on my winter coat and trudged ten blocks through the snow to the bead shop to buy a sturdier clasp . When I returned , I had n\'t even put the key in the lock when the phone started ringing . I dumped my bag on the floor , pulled off my gloves , and ran to answer it . " Where have you been all afternoon ? I \'ve been calling you for hours ! " "           to do some shopping . I \'ve only been gone an hour . " Abigail has a tendency to exaggerate . I like to call her on it when I can . " Well , it seemed like hours . Listen , darling , I \'ve only got a minute . Franklin and I are going to a party at the Guldens \' . " Franklin Spaulding was n\'t just my mother \'s lawyer , he was Aunt Abigail \'s , too , for years and years . A few months ago , he became her husband as well . He and Abigail make an odd couple , but they are perfect for each other . " I saw Garrett , and he told me where he \'s taking you for dinner tonight . " " He did ? He has n\'t even told me where we \'re going for dinner tonight . " " I thought as much . " She harrumphed . " Men always think women like surprises , but they \'re wrong . We pretend to like surprises , but what we really like is being           like surprises . I love surprises . Surprises are romantic . " " Of course they are , darling , as long as you \'re prepared for them . If you \'re not , they can be simply awful . Which brings me back to the reason for this call : What are you wearing tonight ? " I was n\'t surprised by this question . Abigail is always quizzing me about my wardrobe . It \'s really none of her business what I wear , but I decided to humor her . " Since it \'s New Year \'s , I thought I \'d dress up a little . I \'ve got that black jersey wrap dress . It \'s nice . Very New Yorky . " " It is nice , darling , but not quite nice enough . Not where you \'re going . " " Abigail ... " She sighed impatiently . " I do n\'t have time to argue , Liza . Really , I do n\'t . In a little while a deliveryman will be knocking at your door . I called to make           I \'ve sent you a dress . It \'s from my closet , but it should fit you perfectly . " Abigail and I are the same height and wear the same size , but she \'s sixty-five years old . " Abigail , you \'ve got to be kidding . You want me to wear one of your old dresses ? On New Year \'s Eve ? " " Yes , I do , " she said archly . " And you \'re welcome . Do you have any idea how much it costs to hire a messenger service to deliver from New Bern to Manhattan on New Year \'s Eve ? " I tried to interrupt , but she cut me off . " Liza , do n\'t be difficult . I have n\'t the time . Wear the dress , darling . Trust me . You \'ll be glad you did . " " But where are we going ? Why would Garrett tell you and not me ? " She ignored my questions . " Must run . Bye-bye . Have a wonderful time . "           up before I could say another word . The new semester would n\'t begin for a few more days . Two of my roommates , Kerry and Janelle , still had n\'t returned from vacation . I \'d been home in New Bern for Christmas but had returned to the city early because Professor Williams-Selena Williams , who headed up the art history department-had asked me to help her do some research for an article she was writing about the influence of Clement Greenberg on abstract expressionism . She \'s my favorite professor , so I jumped at the offer . Zoe , who slept in the bed next to mine , was the only other roommate in residence . She had gone home for Christmas , but Zoe \'s relationship with her mother-and her stepfather , one in a series of stepfathers-is pretty rocky . Consequently , Zoe never stays home one minute longer than she has to . When I told her that Aunt Abigail was having one of her dresses messengered to me from New Bern and wanted me to wear it on my date with Garrett           her mouth , and pretended to gag . " Is she serious ? Is n\'t your aunt older than the Chrysler Building ? There is no way you can wear one of her old dresses out on New Year \'s Eve . She \'s probably worried you \'ll go out on the town with-horrors ! -a hemline that \'s actually above your knees and that Garrett will be so senseless with lust at the sight of your bare legs that he \'ll put a roofie in your drink and take advantage of you while you \'re unconscious or something . " Zoe ambled over to the tiny , cube-shaped refrigerator that sat between our beds , pulled out a diet soda , and popped the top . I shook my head . " She \'s not like that . " She is n\'t . Actually , Abigail has very good taste in clothes . Unlike a lot of older women with money to burn , she does n\'t go around buying fabulous designer fashions that were created for twenty-five-year-olds but look ridiculous on a sixty-five-year-old . Abigail says that at           sailed . The most I strive for at this point is to be clean . " That \'s silly . I \'ve never seen her look anything less than beautiful . Her clothes are very fashionable , great fabrics , but always age appropriate . When I \'m her age , I hope I look half as good as Aunt Abigail . But that \'s just it . I \'m not her age . Abigail has great clothes , but I could n\'t imagine that anything in her closet was going to look good on me . Especially not for New Year \'s Eve in New York . " Just wait and see , " Zoe said between slurps of soda . " Aunt Abigail \'s henchman is going to show up at your door with something that has long sleeves , a granny skirt , a turtleneck , and matching opera gloves . Something long and lumpy . Maybe a full-length snow parka . I \'m telling you , Liza , she \'s just worried about you showing off too much skin . When the delivery guy shows up           you can always lie , you can say you had to go out before he came and never saw the dress . " Not so long ago I \'d have had no compunction about lying to Aunt Abigail , but I like to think I \'ve grown up a bit since then . Even so , when I heard a knock on our door , I let Zoe get to it first . I stood behind her , nervously eyeing the white dress box as she signed the delivery confirmation slip and closed the door . Zoe carted the box into our room and tossed it on my bed . We both stared at it . " Well ? Do you want to open it ? Or should I ? " It was a big box , big enough to hold a lumpy , full-length snow parka . I hoped it did n\'t . " No . It \'s all right . I \'ll do it . " Taking a deep breath , I took the box top off , pulled back the layers of white tissue paper , and           I had ever seen in my life ! The design was simple : a long , straight sheath of ivory silk , with a knee-high slit in one side . The fabric of the dress was covered with long , wavy lengths of thin silver ribbon , stitched with silver thread , making a subtle and beautiful pattern , like wind rippling over water . The ribbons ran vertically from the long hem up the full length of the skirt until they ended , cutting off at varying points along the tight-fitted , V-necked bodice , fading away one by one , so that the fabric at the shoulder seams of the sleeveless gown was a simple expanse of shimmering silk . It was the most beautiful dress in the world . For a moment , we stood there , speechless , but Zoe found her voice first . " Liza , " she said , " I take back everything I said about your aunt Abigail . " " Yeah . " " Well ? What are you waiting for ? Try it on ! " It fit perfectly           realized it did n\'t have one . The fabric in the back of the gown scooped into three graceful folds that fell just to the curve of my hip . Zoe whistled . " Liza , I \'d kill to have shoulder blades like yours . They \'re gorgeous . " I turned around and peered over my shoulder to check out the view from the rear . " Thanks . " Zoe picked up some discarded tissue paper and went to put it in the dress box . " Wait a minute , Liza . There are shoes in here too . " She held up a pair of four-inch stiletto sandals whose straps were strings of tiny rhinestones . They were perfect . I sat carefully on the edge of my bed , trying to slip on the sandals without wrinkling the dress . Zoe continued ferreting through the box . " Oh , my gosh ! And diamonds ! Big ones ! " I lifted my head and saw Zoe staring wide-eyed into a black velvet bag . " Let me see that . " She was           an enormous diamond choker . The dress and shoes were new to me-I \'d never noticed them in Abigail \'s closet-but the diamonds I recognized . It was the choker that Abigail \'s first husband , Woolley Wynne , had given her as a wedding present . He died many years before , leaving Abigail a very wealthy widow . Abigail kept the choker in a safe deposit box and had shown it to me once when we were at the bank . Years ago , when she \'d married Woolley , the choker had cost tens of thousands of dollars . I could n\'t imagine what it must be worth now . " Are they real ? Maybe we should hire a security guy to go to dinner with you . " " Of course not , " I lied as I held the choker up to my throat . The thought of having something so expensive in our no-doorman , noluxury apartment made me nervous . There was no point in making Zoe nervous too . The dress and shoes were beautiful , but the diamonds were n\'t           " Who \'d be crazy enough to put diamonds that big in the care of some nameless delivery guy if they were real ? " Who ? No one but Abigail . " They \'re cubic zirconia , " I continued . " Fakes . " I stuffed the choker back into the velvet bag . Zoe twisted her lips doubtfully . " Well , they \'re the best fakes I ever saw . Are n\'t you going to wear them ? " " Uh-uh . I \'ve got something better in mind . " After helping me with my hair , Zoe headed off to Times Square to ring in the New Year . " This is probably my last New Year \'s in New York . I figure you got ta do it once , you know ? " I nodded in agreement , but I was glad I was n\'t joining her . I do n\'t like crowds . Standing for hours , squashed between hordes of howling strangers in the freezing cold , waiting for a glowing ball to drop was not my idea of a           right on time . I \'d never seen him in a suit and tie before , let alone a tuxedo . He looked so handsome . I was glad Abigail sent the dress . And he was carrying not one rose , but an armful-two dozen long-stemmed pink roses tied with a white satin bow . " They \'re beautiful , " I breathed and buried my nose in the bouquet , the silken petals brushing against my skin . " You \'re beautiful , " he said . " You look like Keira Knightley . But taller . " I lifted my eyes from the flowers . " Do n\'t tease me . " " I \'m not . You look amazing . Like a movie star . Better than that . You look like you . Exactly like you . The dress . The shoes . Everything . And the necklace . It \'s beautiful . " " Do you like it ? " I asked , fingering the silver beads . " I made it myself . " " I love it . I love everything I           Garrett and I \'ve been dating for a long time , but I suddenly felt awkward . I went to find a vase so I could put his flowers in water . " You look great , " I called over my shoulder . " Where \'d you rent the tuxedo ? " " I bought it . Had it tailored . " He shrugged . " I figured I was too old to wear a rented tux . Who knows ? Maybe I \'ll be able to use it again . " I laughed . " Planning on joining the country club , are you ? Going to the charity galas along with Aunt Abigail and the rest of New Bern society ? " " There are other places to wear a tuxedo besides charity galas . " He looked at his watch . " Ready ? Our reservation is for nine-thirty . " " It is ? " I plunked the flowers in water and grabbed my black wool coat . Not exactly the thing to wear with an evening gown , but it was the warmest one           It \'ll take forever to hail a cab on New Year \'s Eve . We \'ll never get there on time . Not that I know where we \'re going . Where are we going , anyway ? Can we walk ? If not , maybe we should take the subway . " Garrett held out his arm like a courtier asking for the honor of a dance . " Transportation has already been arranged . " My apartment is on the third floor of a five-floor walk-up on Eighty-eighth , between Second Avenue and Third . It \'s not the kind of place you see a lot of limousines idling in front of , but that was exactly what waited for us as we came out the front door . Actually , it was n\'t quite a limousine , not one of those ridiculous stretch jobs they use for celebrities , weddings , or that groups of twenty kids pile into on prom nights . I \'d have hated that . This was just a large and very shiny black sedan . A man in a black suit was           the door for me . I looked at Garrett . " You did n\'t have to do this , " I said , though I was n\'t sorry he had . Even if you \'re not glamorous , every now and then it \'s fun to pretend you are . " I know . I wanted to . I want this to be a night we \'ll remember . Besides , " he said , looking at my sparkling feet , " I could n\'t risk you wrecking those shoes . " It was warm inside the car , so I slipped out of my heavy coat and scooted across the leather seat to be closer to Garrett . He put his arm around me . The chauffeur glanced in the rearview mirror and then pushed a button that raised a tinted glass window between the front and back seats . I laughed . " That \'s what I like in a chauffeur-subtlety . What does he think we \'re going to do back here ? Make out like a couple of high school kids ? " Garrett turned his           , cradling my head in the hollow of his palm as I tilted my face up to his . The tips of his fingers were cool , but his lips were warm and soft and sweet . I liked the way they felt against mine , the way his bangs fell into his eyes and brushed my cheek as his head bent over mine , and the muscled weight of his body pressing me back into the smooth leather seat as we kissed and clung and glided silently through the streets of the city , past sidewalks full of smiling , laughing crowds , everyone happy and everyone hopeful , believing that maybe , just maybe , the best year of their lives was about to begin . It \'s just not in my nature to look at things that way ; I wish it were . But for a little while that night , my wish came true . With Garrett \'s lips on mine as I reached my arms up and draped them over his shoulders like two vines clinging to a strong and steady wall , something           that nothing but good was on the horizon . What lightness ! I felt like I \'d assumed a secret identity , put on a beautiful borrowed dress and shoes supplied by a good fairy , climbed into a pumpkin coach sedan , and suddenly transformed into a sanguine , faith-filled optimist . By the time the driver pulled up in front of the Carlyle Hotel and the matre d \' escorted us to a VIP table near the stage , I was a new person . It felt wonderful . But it did n\'t last . The fairy godmother gown , borrowed rhinestone slippers , champagne by candlelight , the pumpkin coach car-in the end , none of it made any difference . When Garrett dropped to one knee in the middle of the dance floor at the Caf Carlyle while the orchestra played the song he \'d requested in advance , pulled a small blue box out of his tuxedo pocket , and asked me to marry him , the spell was broken . The optimistic , hopeful Liza vanished and the old Liza-the one who knows that           life , the part that comes after the story ends , is hard and uncertain-was back in an instant . Garrett wanted me to marry him . I did n\'t know what to say . Chapter Two Liza Burgess Garrett got to his feet , dusting off the knee of his pant leg as he did . The ring of couples that surrounded us , peering hopefully at us a moment before , convinced they were at the most romantic New Year \'s Eve celebration in New York and ready to witness their approval of our engagement by a round of applause , shifted their eyes and began to dance again , pretending they had n\'t seen Garrett \'s proposal or what , to their eyes , appeared to be my shocked and silent refusal . " Come on . Let \'s go back to the table . " Garrett grabbed my arm and I followed him , keeping my eyes lowered but feeling stares on my back as we left the dance floor , wending our way through the packed press of bodies . The crowd thinned as we           and nearly everyone was dancing , wanting to be near their beloved for the first kiss of the year as the clock struck twelve , balloons dropped from above , and the band played " Auld Lang Syne .

But he should not have been surprised by her resistance . She always resisted sleeping , it seemed , as if she did n\'t have time for it and wished she could do away with the restful state completely . Not that it was going to be restful now that he was there . At the moment there was no cohesion to the visions in her mind , the things surrounding him merely remnants of the electrical impulses and memories of things from the boring waking world in which she lived . He did n\'t understand why anyone would want to wake up . The worlds of the mind were so vast and creative and could keep a person entertained forever . Of course , they could also torment them endlessly , he conceded with a private little smile to himself . The emotion-evoking land of nightmares could range from simple guilt and self-induced fears to the roaring dramatics of beasts and the running from or falling to certain death . The latter was a somewhat lazy method , he felt . It took the finesse of           of his subject in such a way as to turn every part of her own psyche into an antenna of fear , emitting the emotion in powerful , satiating waves of energy . Energy he needed . Energy he craved . He found her at the very center of her mind , the exhausted need for sleep having forced her under , and her uncooperative imagination was simply tossing up flickering images of a sick girl in bed or her father \'s robust laugh . " No , no , this will not do at all , " he murmured . He painted their surroundings in perfect pitch of night , the sparkle of stars above and below them as if they were flying among them . She was , as yet , unaware of him , but she responded to the change in her surroundings with awe and wonderment . Her heart raced at being unsure of her footing . Physics and reality were suspended , but her mind had a hard time accepting that . When a subject first began to dream , the person was only a           in a head-to-toe body stocking , the subject had no color , no hair , no skin or bone . Just the semiformed black mannequin the subject \'s perspective allowed for at first . But depending on the nature of the dream , that would quickly change . The heavy and encumbered could become thin and spry , the ugly could become beautiful , and the beautiful could become plain ; all according to the subconscious needs of the dreamer at hand . But what he liked about this particular woman was that she never once altered her base appearance . The moment she began to dream with him , the blackness would melt away , giving shape to her tall frame with its wickedly long legs and the wide expanse of hips that filled out every outfit she wore with such a nicely pronounced curvature that led to an equally delectable backside . She was busty as well , every movement making her curve in one way or another . Her face was something else , though , aristocratic and elegantly planed , the look of a stern but           ponytail she kept the incredible length of her chestnut hair in or it was her gray eyes that made her seem so severe at first , but then she would smile or cry and it would all change . Or she would become gloriously angry and her beauty would truly explode . He was convinced that this was the way she looked in the waking world . There was never any variation and , in his opinion , there was hardly any need for it . The changes in her appearance came later , by his hand , when it suited his mood , and it was rarely anything more dramatic than the nature of her clothing . Tonight she was flying and her usual jeans and T-shirt were unacceptable . With a thought he dropped a long white gown over her head , the simple silk flowing from shoulders to toes , outlining the curved perfection of her body , clinging to the beauty of her breasts and their outthrust nipples . She liked the gift , the pleasure clear on her lovely face , and he could n\'t           . They had so little time together , and ... ... and there were rules he must follow . Shapeless and dark , he thrust himself up against her from behind , his arm ringing her shoulders and his brute \'s body like a solid wall of muscle and masculinity against her . She startled , her hands immediately going to the arm that held her so tightly . She did n\'t call out a name , telling him that she did n\'t have any notable men in her life whom she felt would come up on her like this . Why the idea should please him , he did n\'t know . Nor did he care . He wrapped his hand around her neck , the delicate length of her throat so unexpectedly narrow compared to the rest of her voluptuous body that he had a moment of fear that he had grabbed her too hard . Then he laughed at himself because it was only a dream , and grabbing her too hard was a part of the nightmare to come . He could see into her mind           of her life ... and most of all , every fear she had ever had . It impressed him that she did not have very many things that scared her . She was as tough as she was beautiful . But everyone had fears no matter how tough a person was , and she was no exception . He merely enjoyed the challenge for what it was . She began to struggle against him in earnest , her feet and legs flailing as she tried to kick him . But she could n\'t hurt him here in this place . Not really . Enjoying how she fought him , he threw her down on the bed that suddenly appeared . He followed over her , a dark hulking figure she could not make out or fight off no matter how hard she tried . She gritted her teeth in frustration , and he simply held her there , trapped and immobile . " Who are you ? What do you want ? " she wanted to know . Then he paid great attention to the details of her trapped body           seemed . As far as jobs went , this was n\'t the worst one to have . " You tell me first , " he taunted her , his voice like gravel and sand . " Obey me or you will not like the consequences . " She thought about it , the stubborn set of her lips telling him she \'d rather get her teeth pulled than tell him anything , but in the end her psychological make-up was going to defeat her . " Kathryn , " she spat out . Kathryn . Oh , how he loved to hear her name . He asked her for it every time , just to hear that defiant burst of passionate declaration . In the first three or four dreams he had n\'t asked for her name , not wanting to attach himself to her too personally , perhaps knowing on some level that there was a danger of it with this creature that was not present in others . Now he knew , and he could not take back the knowing . And he did n\'t want to .           as bold and glorious as she was . She was , he thought heatedly , a one-of-a-kind and most perfect thing . He rose over her , relieving her of the burden of his weight as he hovered above her . She might not be able to make his features out , but her mind would interpret his menacing and covetous expression as he ran his eyes over her stretched-out body . He reached to hold her hands above her head in one of his , then raked a hard hand and curved fingers down over her face , throat , and chest . " You always fight , " he growled , and his harsh hand yanked up the gown and exposed her legs all the way to her thighs . The movement was such a hard one that she shimmied in all of her softest places , emphasizing just how much of a woman she really was . " But I know what you really want , " he told her as his hand scorched up over her thigh and his palm briefly cupped her bare sex .           him , only succeeding in opening herself to him . After all , as far as struggles went , this one was quite mild . Perhaps she was beginning to remember the game . Perhaps she was becoming too complacent . " So , you have no desire to fight ? " he asked her hotly , his breath coming quick even though she was being too easy . Just being this close to her stirred him to distraction . " Where is your fear ? " As he said it everything around the room exploded into flames . The only thing left untouched was the bed , but the heat felt all too real and dangerous . Kathryn cried out , struggling harder now to get out from under him , to get away from the thing she feared the most . He could feel her heart racing ; she was panting hard for her breath . He tore at the top of her gown , exposing her to the waist , pulling her breast out to meet his mouth . When she screamed it was with a splendid           confusion as to why she would react in such a way . But he knew her mind far better than she did , and knew that the excitement of a forcible seduction was one of her darkest fantasies , one she would only ever indulge in here , where it was safe . The fear of the fire only heightened the adrenaline coursing through her . The more intense the danger , the more excited she became . But still the key element was in her resistance to herself . She felt how she responded and thought it was wrong . She felt shame and guilt , like something was defective within her because she grew wet as he gnawed and devoured her nipple over and over again . He wished then that he could truly taste her skin , truly smell the scent of her . He wanted her in real dimensions , not these imaginary ones . He shifted up to crush his mouth upon hers , the full perfection of her mouth calling to him incessantly , day and night , with no quiet to be had           great passion but could experience none of the depth and flavor of her . He knew she could feel his passionate intentions , but he was just outside of truth of definition to her as well . With a roar of fury he burst away from the bed and the object of his dissatisfaction . Ever since he had stumbled upon her the first time , he had been utterly obsessed . He \'d tried time and again to stop , to carry on his work elsewhere , to fill his time with better sources of fear and focus . But always she lured him back , with her infuriating perfection and needful body . She craved so many dark and wonderful things ; she had the deepest of fears and yet faced them with such unbelievable courage . She was utterly fascinating . And he wanted her . Not just in this realm he was limited to , but beyond it . In the real . He would take her-yes ! Yes , he could keep her then , keep her for his very own , and no one           him . He reached out for her , pulling her to her feet and into the fire . Her dress immediately caught flame at the hem and she screamed , struggling to brush away the flames . " Tell me where you live and I \'ll make it all stop , " he promised her . " Stop it ! Please ! " " Tell me , " he coaxed her as the flames leapt higher against her . Drowning in terror and flame , she did . Ripping out of the horrifying nightmare with a gasp , Kathryn instantly tried to beat out flames that no longer existed . Her sudden movement nearly toppled her out of the plain wooden chair she \'d pulled up to her sister \'s bedside . It took her a moment to shake off her disorientation , to realize she had fallen asleep while watching over Jillian . She hurriedly left her chair to lean over her sister \'s bed . Jillian was shivering weakly , her breath rasping in a sickening staccato rhythm . " Hush , now . Rest , love ,           rubbed the grit of weariness from her eyes as she turned to the bedside table . It took her a moment to focus on the paraphernalia there . There were bottles of medicine , a thermometer , and a large china basin with rags soaking in water and melting ice . The bottle labels were a confusion to her for a moment as she tried to get a grasp on her weary concentration . Then she found what she was looking for . She tumbled two small aspirin from one bottle into her palm , hoping to keep Jillian \'s fever down . Then Kathryn grabbed a glass of cool water and turned back to Jillian , maneuvering herself behind the frail ten-year-old \'s head and lifting it until she could manage to wrangle the medicine down the child \'s throat . Jillian accepted the pills well enough for someone who had occasionally been too weak to swallow , and it gave Kathryn a glimmer of hope . What she would n\'t give for the simplicity of children \'s liquid medicine right then . But in the bush of Australia           supplies , and the colorful syrup had run out a while back . " There now , what a good girl you are , " she praised Jillian softly , stubbornly believing that the child could somehow hear her . She spent a moment stroking her sister \'s thin , pale red hair . Then she slid gingerly from the bed . Kathryn waited anxiously for several minutes until she was certain the child had quieted again and was resting as peacefully as she could . Then she straightened stiffly , her hands pressing into the aching curve of her lower back . She looked at her watch , trying to determine what day it was as well as the time . She had called for help almost twenty-four hours ago , but things took time out in the bush . But it should be soon . Hopefully very soon . Kathryn felt her exhaustion with sudden acuteness . Dizziness washed through her and she touched fingertips to her forehead in an attempt to steady herself and her swaying vision . " Father , " she prayed fiercely , "           a harsher wave of vertigo spilled over her . Kathryn ... Kathryn gasped softly when the low , thick whisper reached her ears . She whirled around drunkenly , taking in the madly tilting room to see who had spoken her name . A macabre chill rushed her flesh . " Papa ? " she asked breathlessly , widening her eyes in an attempt to focus . But no one was there but her and Jillian . Kathryn reached to grasp one of the spiraling bedposts , clinging to it as she searched herself for a store of strength she might not yet have tapped . There was none . Kathryn fought back tears . She must find the strength ! Somehow . She was the only one left for her desperately ill family to depend on . She waited , breathing deeply , for the room to stop pitching and rolling around her . She dared not close her eyes . She would surely succumb to the persistent , lurking need to sleep that had harried her every step these last days . She simply did not have the           whenever she did fall asleep , there was nothing there for her but terrible and disturbing dreams . Sometimes , like before , all-out nightmares . Slowly the room righted itself , becoming once again the firm , solidly built expanse of sturdy antique furnishings it had always been . Taking another deep breath , Kathryn took a moment to tuck a straggling tendril of hair back behind her ear . She slipped a palm against her slightly rounded stomach , wishing it would settle as the room had . She could n\'t remember the last time she \'d eaten anything , but it seemed very unimportant when the lives of her family were at risk . Then she took the firmest steps she could manage to the door . She was halfway along the hallway when her vision blurred again and the floor fell away with sickening speed . She collapsed to her knees and hands , jarring her joints as she realized the floor was still very much where it was supposed to be , it was merely her head and her vision leaving much to be desired           she commanded herself fiercely . " You \'re the daughter of Connor Macdonough , the granddaughter of Fiona Macdonough . You shame the Macdonough name if you quit now ! " Somehow , after this empowering speech , she managed to drag herself back up to her feet , using the wall as her main support . She slid herself along it so that she could tell right from left and up from down while using it for the stability her betraying eyes would not provide . She finally reached her father \'s door . " Kathryn . " The whisper was louder this time . Nearer . She convinced herself that it had been her father after all , even though it sounded nothing like him . But the sickness could very easily have put that rough , mournful lilt into his words ... could n\'t it ?

Every word of it . I know because it happened to me . My name is Lemuel Gulliver , and I am a surgeon and world traveler . I had the good fortune to go on many safe voyages before the weirdness at Lilliput . But Fm getting ahead of myself . First off , meet my wife , Mary . Mary : Hello . Gulliver : Mary and I were married before all this happened . As a young man , I served as a surgeon onboard a ship . Upon returning from my first three years at sea , I decided that I had grown weary of the job . I wanted to settle down           London , and I married my dear wife . Our lives were going well for some time . Mary : Yes , everything was going well . Gulliver : But then my friend died , and with him , the business . So what was I to do ? Mary : What was he to do ? Gulliver : I ached and moaned for weeks before the bug bit me once again . The sailing bug . So I hopped a boat , and for the next six years , I once again lived my dream . Mary : His dream . For six years . Gulliver : Well , do n\'t say it like that , dear . I came home to you . Mary : Yes . For three years . Gulliver : And then I went off again . I accepted an offer from Captain William Prichard , master of the Antelope . He was making a voyage to the South Sea , and he needed a well-practiced doctor . Mary : And you left . Again . Gulliver : Yes . We set sail from Bristol           : Three months into the journey , 12 crew members are dead . The deaths have come during a violent storm near the East Indies that rocks the boat for days . Some of the men were swept overboard and lost at sea . Others got sick from spoiled meat . Narrator 2 : The good doctor Lemuel Gulliver does not take their deaths lightly . When the storm at last subsides , the captain meets Lemuel at the stern . Captain William Prichard : It is a beautiful day for sailing , would n\'t you agree ? Lemuel : Aye , aye , Captain . Narrator 3 : Lemuel is heavy with thoughts of the deceased crew members . He does not hide his gloom . Captain : You did all that you could for those men , Lemuel . You acted bravely in the harshest of conditions . Lemuel : Thank you , Captain . Captain : You know , Lemuel , you ca n\'t save everybody . Lemuel : No , sir . Not even myself . Captain : Speak your mind , sailor . Lemuel :           And for what ? To be among dying men and dead souls ? I fear my journey is misled . Captain : You have survived one of the most awful storms I have seen in my 30 years of sailing , Lemuel . And you did it while attending to the infirm ed . You put your own life at risk for those men . In my book , that is not an ill-sought journey . Lemuel : Thank you , Captain . Captain : Carry on . Narr l : The captain leaves Lemuel to his thoughts . Narr 2 : Months of smooth sailing pass . And then , on November 5 , a sudden sea squall attacks the ship . The Antelope is smashed upon a rock and must be abandoned . Narr 3 : Lemuel , the captain , and four other surviving crew members manage to escape the sinking ship by boarding a lifeboat . However , as ill fortune would have it , the sea rages , and their lifeboat is capsized . Narr l : The storm is unrelenting . Lemuel tries to           . Lemuel : O Captain , my Captain , our fateful trip is done ! Narr 2 : Lemuel shouts , but no soul answers . He struggles for an hour against the raging sea , desperate to keep his head above water . Night falls . Somehow , Lemuel feels ground under his feet . He shuffles to shore , a wreck of a man - the sole survivor of the Antelope . Exhausted , he collapses on the beach and passes out . SCENE 2 Narr 3 : At daybreak , Lemuel wakes . He is lying on his back , staring at the sky . Blinded by the sun , he realizes that he can not move . Narr l : His legs and arms are bound tightly by rope . He can not move even his head , for that is tied down too . Lemuel : What sorcery is this ? Narr 2 : Lemuel uses all his strength and manages to break one of his arm restraints . Immediately , a hundred tiny arrows pierce his face and arm . He does not know           n\'t hurt terribly , but he decides it best to lie still and wait for whatever comes . Narr 3 : Lemuel hears quiet commotion all around him . Then , he feels something small walking on his chest . Lemuel : What \'s happening ? Is someone there ? Narr 1 : A man , no taller than 6 inches , appears in Lemuel \'s line of vision . He is a messenger . Messenger : Man Mountain from beyond ! Be still , or we will destroy you . Lemuel : Destroy me ? With what ? Your puny arrows ? They are but needle pricks to me ! Messenger : We have much greater weapons at our disposal , sir . It would behoove you to remain still . Narr 2 : Lemuel does n\'t know whether he believes this tiny messenger , but he decides it best to follow his advice . Lemuel : Very well . Narr 3 : Lemuel can hear the murmurings of foreign speech all around him . Lemuel : What language is that ? What are your people speaking ? Messenger           language . I am considered the smartest among us . I have learned your entire language just by hearing you speak a few words . Do you understand me well ? Lemuel : Yes , effortlessly . But what are Lilliputians ? What strange land is this ? Messenger : Lilliputians are we . You are in the land of Lilliput . Narr 1 : There is some more commotion around Lemuel . The Lilliputians seem to be building something . Messenger : If you are wondering about the hammering , I will explain . The people are building a giant wooden transport . We need to get you to the king \'s royal palace . Lemuel : What are you going to do ? Wheel me in there ? I can walk , you know . Messenger : Forgive our mistrust , sir . But in all our years , we have never seen a Man Mountain such as you , and we need to take the necessary precautions . Surely you understand . It is a matter of national security . Lemuel : I am harmless . I           case , please bear with us while we work . Narr 2 : The messenger jumps down off of Lemuel and joins his people in building the transport . Narr 3 : The massive project takes all day . By midafternoon , Lemuel is feeling incredible hunger . He calls to the messenger and asks for some food and water . Messenger : Yes , of course . It will be done . Narr l : What happens next is a massive consumption . The people bring Lemuel all sorts of livestock - pigs , cows , sheep , and chickens . The animals are so tiny that Lemuel must eat them by the dozens just to alleviate his hunger . Narr 2 : By nightfall , the transport is finished . It takes 900 Lilliputians using ropes and pulleys to move Lemuel onto it . When at last he is secure , they roll him to town , then through the streets toward the palace . SCENE 3 Narr 3 : The Lilliputians chain Gulliver to a building just outside the palace . There , he is finally allowed           he discovers is beautiful and rustic . Gulliver : The country ground resembled a continued garden . And the enclosed fields , which were generally about 40 square feet , resembled so many beds of flowers . These fields were intermingled with woods . But the tallest of the trees , as far as I could figure , were just about 7 feet high . The whole of the area looked more like a theater set to me than anything real . Narr l : The Lilliputians chain observe Lemuel for a few days . On the third day , the king himself pays Lemuel a visit . The messenger translates for them . King of the Lilliputians : So this is the great Man Mountain ? I must say , I have heard many remarkable things about your size . However , none of the tall tales I have heard do you justice . Lemuel : I shall take that as a compliment , Your Highness . King : You must forgive me for not coming to visit you sooner . My people had to make absolutely certain that           Hence , these chains that bind you . Lemuel : I beg your pardon , Your Majesty . I have been telling your messenger for days that I am a man of peace . I wish no harm to you or your people . King : Yes . And I have been in constant meetings with my council about just what we are to do with you . You will be happy to know that we have decided against executing you . Lemuel : Well , that is good news . King : It came down to the fact that no one wanted to clean up your giant , rotting corpse . Narr 2 : Lemuel is relieved to learn he wo n\'t be executed but somewhat concerned by the way decisions are made in Lilliput . King : I must admit , you do seem to be sincere . But men are quite often not as they seem to be , no matter what their size . Lemuel : Spoken wisely , fair king . But , if I may add , what hope have I of convincing you           : The king ponders this . He is at a loss for an answer . From behind him , the queen approaches . The messenger translates for her as well . Queen of the Lilliputians : Who is this Man Mountain that has my kingdom all in a stir ? Does it have a name ? King : This is the Queen of Lilliput , sir . Do please answer her question . Lemuel : My name is Lemuel Gulliver , Your Majesty . And in my three days here , you are the first to ask . Forgive me if I do not bow in your presence . As you can see , your soldiers have fastened me securely to this wall . Queen : Yes , I can see that . It does not look to be very comfortable . Guards ! Release Lemuel Gulliver ! King : My dear , let us not be hasty . I am still sizing him up . Queen : You have been sizing up this poor giant for days ! It is uncivil to leave him in chains any longer .           chains ! Narr l : Several guards approach Lemuel carefully . Several other men protect the king and queen , in case Lemuel decides to become violent . Lemuel : Your Majesties are too kind . King : Yes , well . Just promise not to eat us . Narr 2 : Lemuel chuckles and promises as he is unbound from his chains . The guards scatter from him as soon as he is free . Narr 3 : Lemuel approaches the king and queen slowly . He bows before them . Lemuel : If it pleases Your Majesties , I would like to discuss with you about getting home . King : Home ? No , no , no . Fm afraid we have more important things to discuss with you . Lemuel : With all due respect , Your Majesty , I would very much like to go home . King : With all due respect , sir , I could chain you back to that wall . Narr l : Lemuel looks back at his chains lying on the ground . He also considers the few dozen           people could take him in a fight . However , he does not have a taste for violence or killing . So he plays along . Lemuel : I understand . What is it you wish to discuss ? Queen : Let us speak of politics and war later . Lemuel : War ? Queen : Later , Lemuel Gulliver . For now , you are our guest . Let us celebrate . Narr 2 : The queen claps her hands , and suddenly , dozens of tiny circus performers appear . They dance and sing as Lemuel watches , trying to stay as out of the way as possible . Narr 3 : During the celebration , many Lilliputians dance and play games at Lemuel \'s heels . He is amused but dares not join in the merriment for fear of accidentally crushing them . Narr l : When night falls , the king and another man walk up to Lemuel to discuss important matters . The messenger once again translates . King : Mighty Lemuel , allow me to introduce to you my secretary of Private Affairs ,           . Lemuel : Good evening . It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance , sir . Reldresal : Likewise . King : I must attend to the queen . You two have much to discuss . Narr 2 : The king takes his leave . Lemuel : And what is it that we have to discuss , sir ? I imagine you are here to school me on some war effort ? The king mentioned it to me briefly . Reldresal : Yes . War . Our good country has enemies , Lemuel , both foreign and domestic . Lemuel : I see . Reldresal : Here at home , there is a small group of dissenters . You see , our kingdom is made up of two kinds of people : those who wear boots with low heels , and those who wear higher heels . Lemuel : Right . OK . Reldresal : During his reign , the king has favored to employ mostly those who wear boots with low heels . Narr 3 : Lemuel takes a closer look at the many dancing Lilliputians . Sure           Lemuel : Oh my . I had n\'t noticed it before . Perhaps that was because you are all so tiny that a mere half inch in your heights had escaped me . Reldresal : Right , well , there is no need to poke fun at our meager stature , Man Mountain . Lemuel : Apologies , sir . I meant no disrespect . Reldresal : Regardless , the Lilliputians who favor high heels are not as big a threat right now as our foreign enemies . Lemuel : And who might they be ? Reldresal : They hail from the distant island Blefuscu , the only other great empire of the universe . Lemuel : Forgive me , sir , but you do realize there are more than two empires in the universe , do n\'t you ? Reldresal : Hogwash . Lemuel : No , it is true . I , myself , hail from a place called England . Reldresal : And England is in the stars , yes ? For we all know you fell from above . Lemuel : What ? No , England           Reldresal : Earth ? Lemuel : Yes , Earth . Our planet . Narr l : Reldresal stares at the ground beneath his feet . He considers what Lemuel is saying , but then he makes up his mind that the Man Mountain must merely be drunk . Reldresal : Surely you have had too much wine during the festivities , Lemuel . For we are standing on Lilliputian soil , and the only other nation in the universe is Blefuscu . And it is a warring nation . We have been at war with the Blefuscians for many , many moons . Narr 2 : Lemuel chooses not to continue the geography lesson . In fact , he is not even entirely certain they are still on the Earth that he knows . Lemuel : Can there be no peace between your two nations ? Reldresal : Fm afraid not , Lemuel . For you see , it all started six and thirty moons ago when the incident of the egg occurred . Lemuel : What is " the incident of the egg " ? Reldresal : Well ,           . However , one day long ago , a traitor decided to crack an egg from the big end . Lemuel : You do n\'t say . Reldresal : Yes ! And when news of this terrible egg treason reached the shores of Blefuscu , the Blefuscian government supported big-end egg breakers and welcomed them to their land . And with that , the war began . It has raged ever since . Narr 3 : At first , Lemuel thinks this history is ridiculous . But then he considers some of the wars his own nation has fought and realizes that no war has ever begun with sanity . Lemuel : High heels and egg ends , you say ? Reldresal : Yes , Lemuel . We will deal with our heel problems here at home , but we would very much appreciate it if you could help us in our war effort against the nation of Blefuscu . Lemuel : I have told the king , sir , that I am not a violent man . But if in helping your people I can gain permission to return           Superb ! I shall run and tell the king the good news . Narr l : Reldresal rushes off . The messenger who has been translating for them this whole time looks fondly at Lemuel . Messenger : Between you and me , Man Mountain , I prefer bare feet and bacon . Narr 2 : Lemuel laughs so loudly that the sound of his joy can be heard all the way across the ocean , in the nation of Blefuscu . SCENE 4 Narr 3 : In the morning , the king holds council with Lemuel . He allows Lemuel to travel to LiIliput \'s highest hill . From there , with the aid of his spectacles , Lemuel can see the neighboring nation of Blefuscu . Narr l : Blefuscu is an incredible journey across the sea for the tiny people of Lilliput . However , Lemuel figures that he could swim the distance in less than an hour . And that is what he sets out to do . Narr 2 : When he arrives at the port of Blefuscu , the people all scatter . They           . Blefuscian 1 : Save yourselves from the giant who swims in our waters ! Blefuscian 2 : Gather your women and children ! Head for the hills ! Blefuscian 3 : To arms , men ! To arms ! Narr 3 : As some of the tiny men gather up their families and run , others grab their bows and arrows . Narr l : Lemuel gets to work tying together the armada of ships with hooks and cables that he has brought with him . He is pelted by thousands of small arrows , but he has felt this sort of onslaught before . Their weapons merely sting his skin . Lemuel : Your arrows are no match for my size ! Narr 2 : Having tied up all the boats , Lemuel seizes the cables between his teeth and begins to swim for Lilliput . Narr 3 : Upon his arrival , he is heralded as a hero by the entire nation . The messenger translates the king \'s praises for Lemuel . King : Mighty Lemuel Gulliver ! Welcome back ! You have brought us a           I hereby grant you the title of Nardac , Lilliput \'s highest honor ! Narr 1 : A momentary hush falls over the crowd . And then , the applause is mighty . King : Upon the morrow , Lemuel , you shall swim to the shores of Blefuscu once more and capture prisoners of war . At long last , we shall enslave them and rule their country ! The egg yolk will be all over their faces ! Lemuel : But ... fair king ... it is time I was returning home . I have captured your enemy \'s mighty fleet for you . My part of the bargain is finished . Besides , I do not feel comfortable in this role between your warring lands . I feel as though I am intruding in politics and histories where I do not belong . Narr 2 : The king is dismayed by Lemuel \'s response . He leaves to talk it over with his council . When he returns , Lemuel is in the midst of a great celebration . Tiny women are kissing his mighty feet ,           : Away ! Away with you all ! And do n\'t think I \'m not taking note of those of you with heels that are higher than mine . You will be dealt with in due time . Narr 3 : One small girl remains on Lemuel \'s shoulder . She whispers in his ear in Lilliputian . Girl : I love you , Man Mountain . We all do . Your heart is by and large your greatest part . Narr 1 : The girl plants a tiny kiss on Lemuel \'s cheek and then scurries down his back and runs away with the others , giggling . Lemuel : I understood her ! Is it possible that I have learned your language ? Messenger : Great sir , you are speaking in Lilliputian now ! Queen : War hero and genius linguist ! Is there anything you can not do ? Lemuel : Once again , I must insist that I can not take prisoners for you , or be any more part of this ancient war of yours . King : Yes , you are right ,           we do agree that your part in our mighty war is through . However , I beg of you to stay just a wee bit longer . If the Blefuscians decide to retaliate , we would certainly feel safer having you as our mighty protector . You are , in fact , the greatest thing that has ever happened to us . Narr 2 : Lemuel is overwhelmed by the royal compliment . Lemuel : Your words touch me , Your Majesty . Yes , I will stay and see this through . I will make certain that not a hair on any Lilliputian \'s head is harmed until your two lands make peace . Narr 3 : With this , trumpets blare and the merriment begins again . For the rest of the day and well into the night , Lemuel enjoys the company of his tiny , grateful friends . SCENE 5 Narr 1 : As the weeks go by , Lemuel keeps careful watch over the people of Lilliput . They bring him flowers and pastries and gold and meat . Lots and lots and lots of           but he never takes his eyes off the tides . Narr 3 : After three weeks of watching , Lemuel sees a lone boat approaching . He greets it at the shore . King of the Blefuscians : Giant protector of Lilliput ! I am the king of the Blefuscians ! I am to surrender to your king . Lemuel : He is not my king , sir . But he will be very glad to hear this news . It will be my honor to bring you , your small crew , and your message of peace to him . Narr 1 : As Lemuel leads the foreign king into the palace , he feels a great sense of worth and purpose . And then , thoughts of home flood his brain . EPILOGUE Gulliver : And that \'s how it went . Like I said , every word is true . The two kings made peace , and a giant statue of me was erected in the palace square . Two weeks later , they constructed a boat for me , and I sailed away . Mary :           home . Gulliver : Yes , Fm still not quite sure how . I had no direction , no compass , just hope . And the winds blew me back to you . Mary : Thank goodness for small favors . Gulliver : Yes . The Lilliputians were quite small indeed . And they favored me greatly . Mary : Of course they did , dear . Gulliver : I have been home for about a year now . But the sea , ah , the great and wondrous sea , she calls to me still . Mary : She is your mistress . Her , and adventure . Gulliver : You know I will always return to you , Mary . Mary : I do , Lemuel . I do . \n In faded photographs , fifteen-year-old Betty Knox had worn not just the usual modest skirts and blouses , but also the usual barely-concealed teenage uncertainty , visible in eyes behind dark-ftamed glasses that had n\'t really been fashionable even by the questionable standards of the mid-1960s . She looked like she should be carrying a book even when she did n\'t have one . Now , fifteen-year-old Betty had a wariness well hidden in those same eyes as they glanced from side-to-side at her classmates . Unlike the rambunctious teens around her , she moved surely , carefully , more aware of what she was doing . She also moved , James Jones thought , like someone unaccustomed to her neat blouse , mid-length skirt , and sensible shoes . While the other teens leaving school streamed off in various directions , Jim sidled close to Betty as she briskly strode down the sidewalk . " Uh , hi . " Her eyes shifted to him . " Hi . " " I \'m Jim . " " Dictionary Jones . I know . " Betty was really giving herself away now . She should be getting a Uttle           by a boy of the same age whom she knew only because they shared the same school . Instead , Betty seemed amused , the veteran of decades of clumsy come-ons who thought this one not just lame , but also cute . It annoyed Jim , so he cut to the chase . " And I know that after Johnson , Richard Nixon is elected president . Then Ford . Who comes next ? " Betty \'s amusement vanished , the wariness back and intensified . " Carter . Jimmy Carter . " " Then Reagan . So now we both know who we are . " " What the hell are you doing here ? " Betty demanded , her nicely permed hair flouncing prettily . " Why are they sending new people down right after we got here ? Those stupid bastards should have - " Jim cleared his throat loudly , and Betty shut up with a guilty look around . " Long story short , they sent us as close to your arrival time as they could manage because the first wave disappeared . "           Betty \'s voice caught . " Disappeared ? " Maybe to any adults watching from a distance they stiU looked like two kids strolling down the street , encumbered with school books , talking about the latest " music " from that new foreign singing group with the outlandish name , The Beatles . But up close Jim could see the Betty in much more recent images , the Betty usually addressed as Doctor Knox . " Within a few months of the aimed arrival dates , " he explained , " every single one of you vanishes , usually with no record of what happened . Removing a few documents before old newspapers and records were digitized and databased could get rid of whatever happened to you as long as it was low profile . But they found nothing you guys did to alter things , and only a few items saying that two of you were reported as runaways soon after your projected arrival times , and there \'s nothing on any of you after this October . " " What about our bodies ? The original ones           Nobody came back , if that \'s what you \'re asking . The bodies are still there , but there \'s nobody home . " " Slabs of meat , " Betty murmured . " You do n\'t have to get aU poetic about it , " Jim said , stung by the image that also might now apply to his own much older self . " I \'m a geneticist , not a poet , Jim , " Betty snapped , sounding very much like Doctor Knox . " When are you from ? " " 2040 . " " The year after we were sent ? " " It took a while to find people who might know you , who could find you as teens , and then to evaluate and train us . " Betty detoured to a vacant bench at a bus stop and sat down , staring outward . " Why exactly are you here ? To find out what went wrong ? To try something different ? To find out if the time patrol bagged the first group of us to keep us           , Jim shrugged . " All of the above . This is by far the longest trip into the past that has been attempted . Did it make you unstable ? Did you actually arrive ? Okay , you \'re here , and you do n\'t seem unstable . " " No more so than any other fifteen-year-old girl . " " But no one really believes in a time patrol . How could that work ? " " It could n\'t . " Betty looked down at her legs stretched out in front of her . " What happened to the others ? To me ? I \'m still trying to adjust to this . Look at my legs . I \'d forgotten how good my legs looked when I was fifteen . At the time , I thought they were too short and too stocky . Which they were , compared to Barbie \'s legs . " Jim felt his own midsection , flat and even . " Yeah . It \'s really strange . I keep expecting to be over ninety years old . I think I           compared to fifteen . . . " " What does the process do when someone is sent back this many decades ? Maybe it does create some kind of instability . Have they even discovered how it works in the time since I left ? " Betty asked . " Even though it \'s only been two weeks for me . " " Two weeks ? Uh , no , they have n\'t figured it out yet . The mechanism causes something to be projected back to an earlier time , to an earlier age in the same body , but what that something is , they do n\'t know . " Betty sighed . " Why not just caU it a soul ? " " Too metaphysical . They \'re still vetoing \' spirit \' for the same reason . The people who trained me usually called it \' self . \' " " That \'s nicely ambiguous . Science finally discovers that something besides the physical body makes us us and then does n\'t want to deal with the implications . " Another sigh as Betty looked across           have to deal with the fact that time-travel is only possible within the lifespan of any living human , so we ca n\'t send someone back to when all of this seriously began . If only we could get someone into Germany before they launched their big chemical manufacturing plants in the nineteenth century ! " Jim did n\'t see much sense in imagining that outcome , since it could n\'t happen . " How are things going now for you ? Have you attempted any progress on the mission yet ? " " Attempted ? " Betty spun on him , glaring , her mood shifting with startling suddenness . " I \'m ? girl , Mr. Dictionary Jones ! Guess who listens to girls in 1964 ? " He could guess the answer by her tone . " Nobody ? " " Nobody ! And they define \' girl \' as any female of any age ! " Betty shot to her feet . " Let \'s keep walking . I ca n\'t just sit and talk about this . " Jim hastened to keep up . "           and shortened her gait . " I hate this . I hate these clothes . I want to put on a t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans and a comfortable pair of sneakers , and I want to be able to move like my fifteen-year-old self can move ! " She jumped upward mid stride , then turned another glare on him . " We played basketball at school the other day . Girl \'s basketball . I took the first shot . " She mimicked a clean overhead toss at a basket . " Everybody gasped and the teacher told me I was unladylike , that only boys threw that way and if I was n\'t careful I ould damage my uterus . " " Really ? " " Yes . I \'d forgotten that the sort of physical activity we know is normal and healthy for girls was beUeved in 1964 to lead to athletic fields littered with expired uteruses . " Her anger faded as swiftly as it had come . " Anyway . After I got my bearings here I tried raising a few topics           a good one . I mentioned a few things about epigenetics , and he got this indulgent look and said when I went to coUege I \'d learn about Lamarck and how wrong he was . Then my mother said maybe I \'d want to get married instead of going to coUege , and I said I could do both and everything went downhUl from there . Of course , both of my marriages ended in divorces , so maybe mother had a point . " " They do n\'t know about epigenetics ? " " They barely know about genetics ! I \'d get further talking to Mendel , because he would n\'t have a lot of preconceptions about what he thought he knew . " Betty shook her head . " Except for preconceptions about \' girls , \' I suppose . It \'s complicated . Lamarck was wrong , but he was also right in a far more subde way than people of his time could grasp . Humanity needed to figure out epigenetics decades earlier than we did if we are to halt the spread of           difference . Right now , though , and for decades to come , it \'s assumed that either Darwin or Lamarck had to be right , rather than understanding diat more than one means of adaptation exists , and that one of those means is directly affected by environmental conditions far less intense than radiation . " She gave him a rueful look . " That \'s why this is going to be a long project , beginning with manually typing letters sent under other names than my own - male names - to nudge people in the right directions . " " Except , " Jim pointed out , " the last record of Betty Knox the project could find in 2040 was a school paper at the end of September , 1964 . As far as we could teU in 2040 , you never got a chance to send any of those letters . Even if you became unstable as a result of the long trip into the past , there should be medical records of that , so the project thinks someone deUberately went after you .           " Are you a bodyguard ? Is that it ? " " If I found you , and you were n\'t crazy , yeah . " Jim flexed one slim arm . " Not much there to work with , but I know a few things about unarmed combat . I do n\'t remember ever crossing paths with you after we left school , but I served in the Marines for a while . " " I do n\'t tiiink I ever talked to you when we were in school together . The first time , I mean . Dictionary Jones , a Marine ? " Betty asked . " Where \'s your dictionary , anyway ? You always carried that book around , and you had it yesterday , so I guess you must have arrived since then . " Jim scowled at the sidewalk . " I came in last night . It was n\'t a dictionary . I did n\'t want to tell anyone what it really was . " He realized she was waiting for him to say more . " It was game rules .           A game ? You were a game geek before game geeks were cool ? " " I do n\'t think game geeks have ever been cool , " Jim said . " Some of us made a lot of money and we impacted the culture a whole lot , but cool ? Dictionary Jones never had a girlfriend , remember ? " " How many boyfriends do you think I had ? " They had reached a house he recognized as hers , not from ancient memories but from his briefings . " We need to talk about whatever theories they developed in 2040 about what might have happened , " Betty said . " And I need to figure out how to contact the two other people I can find in this time to see if they \'re okay . I \'ll be honest with you . I have a lot of trouble believing that something bad has happened to everyone , and that something wUl happen to me . We do need to find out what caused- " " Betty ! " Jim turned to see a woman           Why do n\'t you and your friend come inside and have some cookies ? " the woman called . Doctor Betty Knox blushed liked any fifteen-year-old girl . " Damn ! Mother must think you \'re a potential boyfriend for me . She thinks I need to study less and be more freaking feminine . " " Do you talk like that in front of her ? " " Hell , no ! I ca n\'t even say \' hell , no \' in front of mother . Not in 1964 . " She gave a defeated shrug . " Come on . At least it \'ll explain why we \'re hanging around each other , Mister Bodyguard . But do n\'t plan on getting lucky . " Jim suddenly realized that ever since Betty Knox had mentioned her legs he had been aware of her body under those modest clothes . " Lucky ? " he demanded , feeling guilty " We \'re both fifteen ! " " Oh , yeah . Tight and virile young bodies with the hormones of teenagers and the experienced minds of the old           that would complicate dungs . Have you noticed trouble with focusing on one thing ? How your thoughts bounce around ? " " Yes , now that you mention it . " " Our physical brains , our bodies , are fifteen . Our selves are being affected by that . " She took a long , deep breath . " Maybe too much so . Maybe the danger lies within ourselves . " Betty and Jim had spent a while strategizing in low voices over cookies and milk . It was n\'t until he was leaving and caught the knowing expression on the face of Betty \'s mother that he realized how that must have looked , two teenagers with their heads close together for a long time . One thing Betty had insisted upon was that he had to maintain his original life . " You ca n\'t go rogue from who you were at fifteen , Jim . This society could n\'t handle that . Our parents could n\'t handle it . That was the project \'s assessment before I came here and I \'ve seen nothing           your job for the project and live the life of Dictionary Jones at the same time . " Now Jim walked up stairs he only dimly recalled , opening a back door whose image had completely faded from his memory , to see his mother standing in the kitchen making dinner . " Where were you ? " she asked . " I was visiting a friend . " " That \'s nice . " Times had changed . In 2040 , parents would track their child \'s whereabouts constantly by GPS chip and freak out at any deviation from planned , safe , organized , and adult-supervised after-school activities . Funny how the restrictive society of 1964 also produced more freedom in other ways . " Is there anything I can help with ? " Jim asked . That earned him a startled look from his mother . " No . Thank you . Just go ahead and watch the TV until dinner . " He ambled into the living room , trying to move more like a teenager , then spent almost a minute reflexively looking around for           Jim walked to the hulking TV console , almost as big as the widescreen on one wall of his home in 2040 but with a screen barely twenty inches across , and after studying the knobs turned one until it clicked . Aside from a humming sound , nothing happened . Jim waited , and waited , finally moving to peer inside the console through air vents in the side . The orange-reddish glow of vacuum tubes met his eyes . How long did it take vacuum tubes to warm up ? His memories of that were dimmed by time and affected by what he had come to accept as typical . Giving up , Jim went back to the couch and flopped down , grinning as he enjoyed the feel of being physically fifteen again . But then the grin vanished as his little sister Mary walked in . She stopped and glared at him . " Is there something wrong with you ? " " Uh , no . I \'m just glad to see you . " Mary had died abruptly in 2006 of an undiagnosed heart           me like I was some kind of freak . " " No ! I was very glad to see you . " Already disoriented from his future self arriving in the early morning hours , it had been hard not to break down into tears when he saw Mary again . He had been told to be careful what he did , to avoid any unnecessary changes to the patterns of the past , even though no one knew how hard it would be to actually change the past . But he would make sure that heart ailment was found in time . She gave him a suspicious look , then went to the TV , which had finally produced coarse black-and-white images . Mary flicked the channel changer , rapidly spinning past empty channels to the only ones with signals . NBC , ABC , CBS . NBC , ABC , CBS . On the third go round of the same three channels , she stopped on one showing a dancing package of cigarettes . Cigarette ads on TV . Somehow that seemed to epitomize the prevailing tendency toward           back to him . Before leaded gasoline was banned in the United States , an estimated seven million tons of lead had been released into the air , soil , and water from that source alone . " There \'s nothing on , " Mary said with disgust . That had n\'t changed . How many times had Jim said the same thing after scrolling through hundreds of channels ? He tried to remember when his family had bought their first color TV . One with transistors rather than vacuum tubes . It had been after he enlisted to avoid being drafted . What kind of idiot joins the Marines so he wo n\'t be drafted into the Army ? Mary had said , her hair much longer then and her jacket adorned with a peace symbol . " What are you looking at ? " Mary demanded . He realized that he had been watching her again , remembering all that had been , that once would be , and wondering what would happen now . There was only one way back from a trip into the past ,           at a time . The Marines again ? He had been lucky in \' Nam , picking up only a few minor injuries and a lot of memories he had spent a long time trying to deal with . But it would take only a very tiny change in where he stood to put an enemy bullet into his heart rather than grazing his shoulder . He was no longer a kid to whom death was an alien thing that happened to others . He knew how easy it would be to the in \' Nam if he risked it again . And how could he stand seeing his old pals again at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego , knowing which ones would n\'t be coming home ? Could he even consider replaying that part of his past when a larger responsibility now rested on his shoulders ? He had wondered about that before , but it had all been sort of abstract , not real . Now it was as real as the past that had become his only present . " Somebody \'s deep in           \'s ready . I made that frankfurter casserole you like . " Jim sat down at the dinner table , grinning at the once-loved and now almost forgotten meal . But his smile faded as he thought about what was likely in that food . No . Not too much yet.Most of the stuff that leaches into the human food supply , or is deliberately introduced into it because if s thought harmless or even beneficial , comes later . Betty still has time to change things . He had been ninety-one years old when the project contacted him . Unlike the newest generations , plagued by a host of ailments , there was nothing physical specifically wrong with Jim , just a very tired body , so that he faced each day knowing that it might be the last , and accepted that reality with weary resignation . He had already felt like a time traveler then , one who had jumped forward to a period when no one remembered the things that had been important when he had been young , and were now concerned with things he           had told him this was important , that he could make a difference , because almost eighty years ago he had gone to the same school as a girl who had become a highly respected geneticist and now needed help . Jim looked at his mother again , fighting down a sense of disbelief . Alive . Healthy . Astounding things that he had taken for granted the first time he had been fifteen . She had died from cancer in 1984 . Cancer later discovered to be triggered by some of the chemicals , plastics , and industrial byproducts that by the midtwenty-first century were overwhelming humanity with its own toxins . Aggravating the assault on mankind were bacteria and viruses that had developed immunity to every countermeasure due to clumsy overuse of those countermeasures . By the time humanity figured out what its own creations and leavings were doing to it , it seemed to be too late to do anything about it . Except that another discovery offered a way that might provide a head start on solutions , and maybe a way to limit the damage           vanished in time , and now he had to find out why and help Betty change history in smaU ways that might over time add up to very big differences . The next day , Jim stood in science class , staring at the silvery globules of mercury that the teacher had doled out to the students . This was one of the classes he shared with Betty , who sat at the other side of the room and was almost cringing away from her sample of mercury . The other kids were laughing and playing with the stuff , dipping pennies into it to see the copper acquire a silvery coating , and breaking it into little globules which would roU around and merge back into big globules . Tom Farand had stuck his finger into his mercury and was waving around a sUvercoated digit . " Make sure you wash your hands before you stick that finger in your mouth , Mr. Farand , " the science teacher instructed in a severe tone . Betty shook her head like someone emerging from shock and her hand rocketed into           extremely toxic substance ? " " Toxic ? " The science teacher nodded judiciously . " It can be poisonous if ingested , yes . " " What about inhaling fumes ? Or absorption through the skin ? Could n\'t even a tiny amount of mercury cause serious neurological problems ? " The other students were watching Betty now , some nudging each other and laughing , while she reddened slightly in embarrassment . Jim raised his hand . " I \'ve heard the same thing , sir . Mercury is incredibly neuropathic and ingesting even small quantities leads to sensory impairment . " " Dictionary Jones and his big words , " someone whispered . The teacher frowned . " I \'m not aware of that , Mr. Jones . Or what you say , Miss Knox . If there are scientific studies that support what you say , and you want some extra credit , why do n\'t you two produce a paper on the topic ? " By now most of the class had stopped laughing and were looking down at their globules of mercury with worried           . " Thank you . It was so nice not to be the sole voice of sanity . One small step at a time . We get people thinking about this a few years earlier and let the results snowball . I hope . " " Do those studies exist yet ? " Jim asked . " I do n\'t know . That area was n\'t supposed to be my priority . I did memorize some of the places and people who are working on things like that right now . But a big part of the problem is that existing means ca n\'t detect extremely low levels or the impact they \'re having . What \'s your specialty , Jim ? " Here it came . " I do n\'t really have one . No advanced degrees at all . I did a lot of stuff and have a decent general background in science and technology , but my primary qualification for being chosen for this was because I went to school here at the same time you did and I was still alive . " " Oh .           so many of the highly-degreed had reacted to such news , Betty smiled at him . " Some of the dumbest people I ever met had the most advanced degrees . See you after school . " He watched her leave , smiling to himself , until a hand hit his shoulder hard enough to make him stumble . " When did you two fall in love , Dictionary ? " Tom Farand asked , whlle several other boys laughed . " We were talking about working together , " Jim said . " Working ? Nobody works with girls . " " Why not ? " The question seemed to stagger Farand for a moment . " Because they \'re girls ! " The sort of attitude that Betty had blown up about yesterday . Jim had vaguely remembered the ways women had been put down when he was young , but things had changed so much by 2040 that the reality of it had dimmed considerably . Now here it was , full strength , and he could only imagine how hard it must have been for Betty           he could do was stand up for her , but Jim \'s young hormones provided words before his older self could censor them . " Wow , " he said to Farand . " That is so dumb . The mercury must already be affecting your brain . " Farand \'s face reddened . " Watch your mouth , Dictionary . " His right arm shot out to stiff-arm Jim \'s shoulder . Jim \'s left arm came up and easily parried the blow in a move he had learned years from now , leaving Farand and the other nearby students gaping at him . " Sorry , " Jim said . " I should n\'t have put you down like that . But you should n\'t put down girls , either . And do n\'t try to hit me again . " Jim turned and walked off toward his next class , realizing belatedly that he had just done something out of keeping with being fifteen . As he left school that afternoon he saw Betty among a group of girls , most of them talking a nule a           whUe the gaggle of girls pointed at Jim and emitted a gust of giggles . " God help me , " Betty whispered to Jim as they started walking . " They were talking about who the cutest Beatie was . I thought I was going to go insane . " " I always liked Paul , " Jim commented , " though not in the same way the girls did . " " Paul was great . I told them John was a jerk and they were all \' no \' and - " Betty slapped her forehead . " Stop talking about it . " " In a couple of years you can argue with them about who \'s the cutest Monkey . " " Mickey , " Betty replied immediately , then slapped her forehead once more . " I have n\'t forgotten anything , but my feelings are turning fifteen again . I have one of those portable record players and I spent a whlie last night listening to 45s on it . Why do I have a 45 of Lesley Gore singing \' It \'s           ? " " You could get a copy of \' You Do n\'t Own Me , \' " Jim suggested . " Did that come out in \' 64 ? Talk about anachronisms ! I need to find that record . " She bit her Up . " Are you starting to get a good appreciation for the challenges we \'re facing ? Memories are one thing , reality is another . " " Yeah . But because of that stupid civil defense drill we did today , I did think of something else that might help . " Betty gasped out a sad laugh . " Crouching under our desks as protection against nuclear weapons . How could anyone seriously believe that hiding under a spindty school desk would protect against a nuclear shock wave ? " " Duck and cover , " Jim recited . " Yeah . Ridiculous . But I was thinking how that changed , how people came to realize that nukes were more than just bigger bombs . People wrote books and made movies about nuclear weapons destroying everything and it changed how people           " " Where everybody dies from radiation ? That movie gave me nightmares . " " That \'s the point ! " Jim said . " Within a few years everybody is going to start getting nervous about radiation and mutants . I told you about my game . Well , I looked at what I \'d done , and it \'s really a mess , because I did n\'t know how to design a game like that when I was fifteen . I can do it right now , though . I could redo Dungeons and Dragons or something , but I wo n\'t , because somebody else came up with that , and I \'m not going to steal their ideas even if they have n\'t had them yet . " " Really ? " Betty gave him a sidelong look . " Technically you ca n\'t steal something that someone else has n\'t even created yet . " " See , that \'s why I did n\'t become a lawyer , " Jim said . " I do n\'t care about technicalities like that . It would           about what \'s choking humanity to death in 2040 . " " Jim , you ca n\'t demonize technology . Some of the project \'s opponents accused us of wanting to do that , but that was never the intent . We need technology . It caused the problems but it also holds the solutions . " " I know ! I need to build a game where the enemies are produced not by paranormal evil , but by high-tech byproducts . And you win by fighting , but part of the treasure is learning new stuff that you can use to help others and counteract the environmental toxins that make things dangerous for you , and if you \'re not careful your own weapons create more problems . " Betty snriled widely at him . " That \'s brilliant . As well as ethical . You can guard me and help our mission . I can stiU focus primarily on advancing genetics research while both of us try to change attitudes about toxins and byproducts . All right . This afternoon we check on Paul and Charlie , who           how to make long distance caUs , and I brought some money . " Betty stopped at a pay phone booth , holding up a quarter . " We were all supposed to operate independently and not even try to check on each other for about six months , to allow us time to get settled in our young selves again . Paul and Charlie are two guys I know enough about to locate . I \'ll call them and see if they \'re still okay , and you can warn them . " " Are n\'t we going to need a lot more money than that ? " Jim asked , eyeing the phone booth . When had those disappeared ? How long after that had it been before pay phones themselves disappeared entirely ? She reached over and tapped his forehead with the coin . " A quarter is real money in 1964 . See ? It \'s actually made from silver . Unfortunately , I do n\'t have a lot of quarters , but it should be enough . " Leaving the folding door to the phone           cradle a few times , then waited . " Operator ? I need to call someone in Stockton . Paul Davidson . He lives on Broward Street . Right . " She waited , rolling her eyes . " Stone age technology , " she mouthed at Jim . He leaned close to whisper . " Wo n\'t the operator be able to listen in ? " " I \'ll be careful , " Betty whispered back , her free hand covering the lower part of the handset . " But we do n\'t have any choice , Einstein . I ca n\'t find out his phone number without an operator and in 1964 some places still ca n\'t handle direct dialing of long-distance calls . What ? " she said into the phone . " Yes . Please . . . put me through . " Feeding a quarter into the phone , Betty waited . " Mrs. Davidson ? I \'m a pen pal of Paul \'s and I - " Jim tensed at the way Betty \'s voice cut off . " He is ? " she           If I do , I will . I \'m so sorry . Did he seem okay before - ? Thank you . Good-bye . " Betty hung up the phone , then took a deep breath and looked at Jim . " Paul disappeared a week and a half ago . No signs of problems . He just was n\'t in bed one morning . " " Try calling the other guy . " But Charlie Bennet had vanished three days ago . He had left school but not made it home . All his desperate mother could tell Betty was that Charlie had been oddly attentive to her and happy in the days before he disappeared . Jim looked both ways down the street , trying to appear casual as he searched for anyone watching them . " They \'ll be labeled runaways . Maybe an article in the local paper . A file at the local police department . Maybe an alert to different departments . Easy enough to make a few things like that go away before records were digitized . " " What really happened to           " We know they never showed up again . Do the math . " " Damn . Damn it to hell . Maybe there is a time patrol . A time patrol that works like the Gestapo . " " I do n\'t care if it \'s a damned killer cyborg . No one \'s getting you , Dr. Knox . " " Call me Betty , you idiot . " She grasped his arm tightly . " Was anyone sent back at the same time as you to watch Paul and Charlie ? " " They did n\'t tell me , " Jim said . " With the first wave disappearing and all , there was a lot of concern about security with the second wave . There was also some talk I overheard about funds being really limited this time . I do n\'t know how many there were , or who they were going to watch . And the aiming process must be more imprecise than we realized . I was supposed to get here within a day of your arrival , and I was two weeks           . " Betty ran her free hand through her hair , keeping a firm grip on Jim with the other . " It \'s real . I kept hoping there was some overreaction , that nothing had really gone wrong . Maybe . . . maybe Paul and Charlie had some warning . Maybe they went underground to avoid some danger . " " Betty , there \'s no trace in 2040 of any activity by them after this . Why would n\'t they have used the code words you guys were told to employ in pubUc communications if anything went wrong ? " " I do n\'t know . I \'m glad you \'re here , Jim . What if they went crazy ? Forgot who they were and fled their own homes because of some instability caused by a trip this far back ? " " That has n\'t happened to you , " Jim pointed out . " Not yet . " One week had gone by , then another . Jim and Betty , lowering the pitch of their voices and using different pay phones ,           areas where Paul and Charlie had lived , trying to find out any more information . But as the days passed with no signs of the boys , the police began responding with the word " runaway " and none of the hospitals reported having anyone matching the boys \' descriptions . Jim and Betty fell into a pattern . They walked to school each day , and then he walked her home in the afternoon , or to the library . One of the hardest things to adjust to had been the inabiUty to have research databases at their fingertips . Instead , Jim and Betty relearned the arts of looking up books in file catalogues and finding items in heavy encyclopedias . They also spent a good part of the weekends together . When not working at drafting her letters , they took breaks by working on his game rules . Betty occasionally spoke openly of wanting Jim around in case she became mentally unstable , " though my teenage mood swings might make it hard to spot for a while . " Despite Betty \'s protests ,           room every night . " I have to watch your house , and I have to watch for anyone else watching your house , " he explained . " What if you \'re caught , Jim ? " Betty asked . " They do n\'t have stalkers in 1964 . They have love-struck teens . I \'m varying the times I sneak away from home , and varying how long I stay out watching your place . That increases my chances of spotting anyone hanging around your home and limits the chances of my being caught . " " I still feel guilty knowing you \'re doing that . " Betty was taking a break as she massaged a hand cramped from manual note-taking . " It \'s bad enough that you have to spend so much time with me during the days . " " It \'s not a hardship , " Jim repUed . " I kind of like it . " She smiled . " Then why have n\'t you tried to kiss me ? " " Because I do n\'t trust myself . To stop at           how hormoneaddled I am sometimes . " " Tell me about it . " Betty sighed . " You \'re right . We know too much about that , about how good it would feel , and our older selves might not have enough control to keep us from going too far . Especially since you \'re probably the only boy in our school who knows how to get a girl \'s bra off . If we got caught , there \'d be hell to pay and you \'d never be allowed within a half kilometer of me again . " " So instead we \'re being the models of wellbehaved youth , circa 1964 . " " That is so weird , is n\'t it ? " She picked up her pen . " Back to work , Mr. Jones . " " Why have n\'t I seen Bill around ? " his mother asked at dinner . " Bill ? " One of Jim \'s closest friends when he was fifteen . They had talked at school in the last few weeks , but that was it .           He \'s been busy ? " Mary said . " Maybe you \'ve been busy spending every minute with Betty Knox . They \'re always together , " Jim \'s littie sister continued dramatically . " Every minute of every day . Everybody \'s talking about it . " His mother bent a smile toward Jim . " I \'m glad you \'re spending time with her . She \'s a smart girl . And a nice girl . " Only because we do n\'t dare do anything , Jim thought . " We \'ve got a lot in common , " he mumbled , feeling fifteen years old again in everyway . " Mom said she was smart , " Mary remarked . " How could you have anything in common with her ? " " Maybe I have reservoirs of intellectual capacity that you \'ve failed to appreciate . " No sooner had Jim said that than he knew it had been a mistake . His fifteen-year-old self never would \'ve spoken that way at home , and now his mother , father , and Mary were watching           book , " he added hastily . " What book was that ? " his father asked . Austen ? It had sounded like something one of her characters would have said . But did teenage boys in 1964 read Jane Austen ? Probably not . " Hemingway . Something by him . " " Pretty long-winded for Hemingway , " Jim \'s father commented . He gave Jim a wink . " Be careful with this Betty girl . You might end up married to her someday . " " If you \'re lucky , " his mother added . To his horror , Jim realized that he was blushing . The library was almost deserted this night , only a few other patrons far off among the book stacks and the librarian half-dozing at her desk , Jim and Betty bent over reference books as they noted contact information and important data . Realizing that Betty \'s pen had Men slient , Jim looked up to see her staring blankly at the book in front of her . Without any warning , she leaped to her feet and           up slowly , tense with worry , and followed at a casual pace , hoping that no one else had noticed Betty \'s sudden flight . He found her at the end of the shelves , facing into the corner between a shelf and the wall , her entire body shuddering with sobs . " Betty ? " he said softly . She did n\'t answer for a moment , then Betty started speaking whlie she kept her face to the wall , her voice coming out rough and so low he could barely hear it . " Ten years from now , my best friend in college , Cindy Arens , will be diagnosed with breast cancer . She \'ll the in 1975 . Sixteen years from now my older brother will be diagnosed with Parkinson \'s disease . He \'ll spend seventeen years suffering before dying from pneumonia . I \'m fifteen , Jim . I \'m physically alive in ways I \'d long forgotten . But all around me I see people I know are dead , and sometimes I know how and when they thed .           if it \'s something pur work could eventually accomplish , and sometimes it \'s too damned hard to even think about . Do you understand ? Or is this a sign that I \'m losing it , becoming unstable ? " Jim tried to keep his own voice level , but heard it quaver . " I understand . Sometimes I feel like I \'m in one of those movies where almost everyone has thed but still walks , like I \'m surrounded by ghosts or zombies . They do n\'t want to hurt me , because they do n\'t know I \'m different . But I \'m alive , and I have memories of them being dead . Most of the time , it \'s wonderful being young again and seeing them alive . But then ... I remember their graves . " She turned around , her face streaked with tears , and lunged into his arms . He held her , and she held him , whlie Betty buried her face in his shoulder . " I ca n\'t help them , Jim . " " I           " The Tonkin Gulf Resolution passed this year . Next year the big build-up begins in Vietnam . Nobody but us knows what \'s going to happen . I knew guys . They \'re alive now , they \'re kids like me , and they \'re going to go there . And some of them are going to the there . And even though I know what \'s going to happen , I ca n\'t stop it . " Betty pulled back a littie to watch him , misery in her eyes . " I \'m so sorry . Our levers are so small , Jim , and the momentum of history is so strong . It will take a long time to make things change even a littie . Too long to save Cindy . Too long to save my brother or your friends . We ca n\'t alter events that are taking place over the next few years . No one would listen to us . The generals , the politicians , the scientists and the doctors today , they all think they know the answers . So           mistake , you \'re doing it wrong , and why should they care ? " He felt old tears of his own coming . " One of the worst things . . . back then . . . sitting in the dirt . . . holding a guy whose life was leaking out . . . feeling so helpless . . . nothing I could do . And it \'s still like that . All over again . " Betty shook her head . " No . You survived . You could do that . And you did the right thing , did n\'t you ? I have n\'t really known you that long , Jim , but I \'m sure you did the right thing . " Jim nodded . " Yeah . I stayed alive . And I kept the faith . I did n\'t let anyone down . But it did n\'t matter , did it ? " Betty clasped him tightly , her head close to him again so her voice was slightly muffled . " It meant you were alive to come back and help           that \'s left , Jim . Maybe all the others in the first wave and your wave are gone and there wo n\'t be a third wave because the project seems to be a Mure , and it \'s up to us to get people thinking a little quicker about environmental toxins and their effect on the human genome , to get research pointed in the right directions . We have to believe that we can make some difference . I did n\'t know it would be this hard to live among our past , but the future of billions of people is in our hands . That matters , does n\'t it ? " He stared at the books before him , not seeing their titles . " I ca n\'t grasp that , Betty . Buttons of people ? That \'s too hard to get a handle on . I discovered a long time ago that someone like me keeps trying because someone else , someone they care about , needs them , is depending on them . " " I need you , Jim . Is that           " Yeah . " She was n\'t crazy , just enduring the same thing that had been tormenting him . Somehow , knowing that someone else understood that , felt that , made it possible to endure . They stood there , holding each other as if sharing their strength , until the lights blinked to indicate the library was about to close , then Jim walked Betty home before he went to his home , a place that existed here and also as a distant memory . The third week since his arrival was drawing to a close . The strange sensation of once again living within a dimly remembered past had faded a bit , but Jim still felt a growing uneasiness , aware that the last trace of members of the first wave had been in October , and they were well into that month now . He and Betty had worked out a coping mechanism they called surfing the past . When around others , they tried to live in the moment , accepting and enjoying moments and people that had once been long gone .           working with each other to change the future . More than once Jim had wondered what it would have been like to be alone with his memories of the future . " I said \' thank God it \'s Friday \' today and everybody looked at me like I said something amazing , " Betty commented as he walked her home . " I wonder if I just coined that phrase ? " " There you go changing history without thinking . " Jim \'s grin was cut off as he felt the itching between his shoulders that sometimes came when someone was watching him . " Excuse me . " He went to one knee , pretending to retie his shoelace , but angling his body as he knelt so the corner of his eye could see behind them . A boy he did n\'t recognize was standing a little distance off , not-watching them in a way obvious to Jim . Jim straightened up , walking with Betty , who eyed him . " What \'s the matter ? " " Do n\'t look , but I think           . Or watching you . I do n\'t recognize him from school . " " A boy our age . " Betty almost stumbled , catching herself . " That does n\'t necessarily mean anything . " Jim paused at a phone booth , using the reflection in a piece of glass to look behind them again . " I think he \'s still there , but a long ways back . " " You ca n\'t tell if he \'s following us ? " " Not without making it clear I \'m watching him . " She looked frightened , but Betty \'s voice stayed steady . " We need to learn a lot more , Jim . If he is another time traveler , why did he come here ? Why is he interfering with things , if he is ? And what happened to Paul and Charlie and maybe all the others who came down with me ? " Jim nodded to her . " So I keep a closer watch out and a low profile . Not let on that I \'m anything more than a           you keep a close watch out too . Tomorrow we can walk around a bit more and see if he shows up again . Maybe we \'ll be able to go someplace where you \'ll be able to get a good look at him . " " All right . " They reached her home and Betty took a deep breath . " I am so glad you \'re here . " She leaned in and kissed him on the lips before he realized what she intended , then walked quickly to her front door . Jim watched Betty \'s house a good part of the night , but saw no one . Saturday morning , yawning , he walked up to her front door and knocked . Betty \'s mother answered , but instead of a welcoming smile she gave Jim a stiff look . " Betty ca n\'t come out today . " The door closed in his face before Jim could say anything . What the hell happened ? Jim went back out to the street , then angled across some yards under cover , working his           any proper 1960s suburban home , Betty \'s house had a few trees and plenty of bushes along the fence line in the back yard , so Jim could stay concealed until he could see the ground-floor window of Betty \'s room . She was sitting there , looking out , and when he waved she put one finger to her lips to invoke slience before tossing him something . Jim picked up a note wrapped around a pen . Mother saw me kiss you yesterday and was worried about me getting too serious with a boy . She tried to have The Talk with me . I made the mistake of trying to reassure her that I knew what I was doing and used the word condom . Mother almost spontaneously combusted . I \'m grounded except for school while I consider the immorality of being knowledgeable about my physical health . He nodded to her , tried to indicate wordlessly that he would keep an eye out , then waved a rueful good-bye before sneaking back out to the street . There was no use making things worse           , sneaking cautiously through night-shrouded terrain , from bush to tree , making no noise , alert to every movement and sound . At least this time he did n\'t have to worry about the VC or North Vietnamese regulars hunting him . Memories of the area around Khe Sanh flooded back as Jim moved into position and settled down to watch Betty \'s house , determined to remain through most of Saturday night . Who was he watching for ? Kids like him and Betty had minds and memories and knowledge from 2040 , but they did n\'t look any different and none of them should be dumb enough to parade their anachronistic nature . The coincidence of the time travelers being targeted meant it had to be other time travelers at work . He had been told the timetravel process was being worked on at multiple locations . It was hard and expensive , but the project was n\'t the only outfit with access to the process . But who would kill kids and why ? The end days people ? The ones who think everything happening in           Armageddon ? There \'s been some killings by groups who think like that . But bow would they get their hands on time-travel equipment ? And why would anyone with access to that stuff help some homicidal religious warriors ? It \'s not just the time travel itself.Whoever this is , they know who was sent back , and they know enough about where those people live to go after them . Betty \'s right . We need to get our hands on this guy and get some answers . Nothing had happened during his previous night shifts except for occasional routine neighborhood activity , but some instinct told him that something would occur tonight . It was almost an hour before anything out of the ordinary did take place , though . Whoever the other kid was , he was n\'t skilled at concealment . Jim heard him before he spotted the boy scuttling along in a fast , noisy , and obvious way apparently learned from watching bad action movies . The boy seemed to be the same size as the one Jim had seen on Friday .           him was another boy , one who bulked physically larger . Either he was a few years older or he had a powerful build . Jim watched from concealment between two bushes , ready to move if necessary but wanting to size up the opposition . The two other boys reached the back of Betty \'s house , less than ten feet from Jim , but seemed totally oblivious to his hidden presence . Light glinted on something in the hand of the larger boy . It had been a very long time ago when he had seen such things , but those were memories that did n\'t fade . It was the play of the moon \'s radiance on the dull metal of a knife blade . Murder ? The other cases had left no clues to the fate of the missing kids , and there had been nothing in future databases . Teenage runaways were one thing , depressingly common , and often resulting in little publicity , especially during this period . But these two did n\'t want the kind of fuss that the murders of children           that kind of thing from public and private records ? If these boys had homicidal intent , they were n\'t planning on killing Betty in her room or anywhere nearby . As with Paul and Charlie , they doubtless intended taking her somewhere distant first , and that meant they needed her able to walk . The two boys did n\'t move toward Betty \'s window , instead casting constant looks toward one of the neighbor \'s houses , where a lighted window spoke of someone still awake . Jim waited , watching , as the two boys grew more and more nervous , then after perhaps an hour and a half had a quiet , heated argument in whispers that Jim could n\'t quite make out , though their frequent glances at the neighbor \'s lighted window made it clear they were worried about being seen by someone in that house . Finally , the two bolted , moving with their clumsy attempts at sneakiness out onto the street , and vanished from sight . He spent another hour on sentry , but the two did n\'t return even           moved out with extreme caution , just in case the other two were still watching , but he found no trace of them . He was certain they would be back the next night , though . The vaunted time patrol had arrived , in the form of two kids with a knife . " Hi , Mrs. Knox . Can I see Betty ? " Mrs. Knox gave him the fish eye , shaking her head . " I \'m afraid not . " Jim tried to project the right degree of awkwardness , innocence , and politeness . " Is she okay ? I \'m really worried she might be sick or something . " Relaxing a bit , Betty \'s mother shook her head again . " Betty \'s all right . She just needs a little time to reflect . " " Oh . " Show disappointment . Show teenage heartbreak . " I just came by to make sure she was okay . " Mrs. Knox \'s severity melted into a reluctant smile . " All right , Jimmy . Wait here and you can           " A few minutes later , Betty opened the door . " Hi , Jim . " She cast her eyes to one side , indicating that her mother was just out of sight and listening . What kind of message , what kind of warning , could he pass to her without her mother understanding and asking questions with answers no one would believe ? " Uh , I , uh , wanted to tell you . . . you remember that bird I saw on Friday afternoon ? The one I talked about and you wanted to see it , too ? It turns out there \'s two of them . I looked them up , and they \'re . . . seagulls . A type called naz gulls . " " Naz gulls , " Betty repeated carefully . " Yeah . Two naz gulls , " Jim said , changing the pronunciation slightly closer to the original word this time . He could n\'t remember if The Lord of the Rings had already been published in the U.S. by 1964 , but the odds that Betty           They \'re here . I knew you \'d want to know . " " Yes . " Betty had paled , but then steadied and looked out on the street warily . " Uh . . . keep an eye on them , okay ? But do n\'t scare them off . Remember , I \'d like to study them more and learn why they \'re here and everything . If you scare them off , there \'s no telling when they might come back . " " All right , " Jim agreed reluctantly . " I \'ll keep an eye out for them . I hope you \'re okay . I , uh , I would n\'t want anything to ever happen to you . You \'re . . . the neatest girl I \'ve ever met . " He had meant the last to be a cute teenage sentiment to explain his stated worries about Betty to her mother , but to his own surprise Jim realized the feelings in his voice were sincere . Betty \'s eyes went from the street to him , her own           with a fifteen-year-old girl \'s lack of guile . " Thanks . I think you \'re pretty neat too . " She sounded like she really meant it . Sunday night- Jim had moved into concealment in Betty \'s backyard as early as he dared , risking detection since it was n\'t quite dark enough to shield him completely . But he made it , settling down in a position he could hold , barely moving , for hours if necessary . All around him the sounds of the neighborhood gradually subsided , lights going off , shapes moving behind curtained windows , voices barely heard , cars passing on the street . In some of those very houses might be children who would grow up to design or manufacture the many devices and other advances that would revolutionize medicine , agriculture , research , and transportation among other things , producing coundess benefits for mankind . They would also produce leavings that would annihilate the lower end of the food chain , aggravate climate change , and poison humans in a tiiousand different ways . He heard people taking           . How many mothers are telling bow many children that ? Keep your work area neat . How many fathers said that today ? All the girl scouts and boy scouts are being told \' safety first . \' But those mothers and fathers , those children , are going to dump unbelievable messes into the water they drink , the food they eat , and the air they breathe . Technology tells us we need to keep our machines clean or they \'ll break down . Science tells us that equations have to be balanced , that remainders do n\'t just go away . It \'s like Betty says . Hi-tech produced the problems we faced in 2040 , but only because people were n\'t paying attention to things they already knew were important . We need to make them think about those things in time to make a difference , and use the tech to find the solutions before they create the problems . The last noises had faded , the last lights had gone out in the houses around him . Jim had stopped wearing his wristwatch           radium , but he guessed it was a little after midnight . He heard the sound of footsteps , thrustie of more than one body pushing through shrubbery too fast to really be quiet . The two boys appeared , walking quickly and hunched over to keep low profiles . They went to Betty \'s window and peered inside . Once again the larger one carried a knife . Sitting still then was the hardest thing that Jim had ever done . Whoever these guys were , they had to be caught in the act , unmistakably guilty , after hopefully being led into saying who they were and why they were after people like Betty . But that meant Jim had to sit , watching as the larger one used his knife to pry open Betty \'s window . As the large boy scrambled inside , Jim took advantage of the noise to shift his own position so that he had his feet under him , ready to move in an instant . They wo n\'t kill her in her room . They did n\'t and they wo n\'t           pounded with growing fear . Betty appeared at the window , moving slowly as she came over the sill and dropped to the ground , the large boy right behind her with his knife out . The other boy grabbed her arm and led Betty away , but she dug in her heels only a few feet from Jim \'s hiding place . " Who are you ? " she whispered . " We \'re friends from 2039 , " the big one mumbled in an unconvincing way . " Friends ? You had that knife at my throat when I woke up ! You threatened to kill me if I did n\'t keep quiet and come with you ! But I \'m not going any farther until you tell me who you are . " The smaller boy spoke quickly . " It was for your own protection . We are from 2039 , just like you are , but we ca n\'t talk now . It \'s not safe . Keep moving , do n\'t make any noise and you wo n\'t be hurt . " Betty stared           away . " Professor Oldham , " she said . " Professor Conrad Oldham . It \'s you , is n\'t it ? " Conrad Oldham straightened his fourteenyear-old body and tried to look down on her , which did n\'t succeed since Betty had a couple of inches of height on him at this age . " For once in your life , Doctor Knox , listen to someone else . If you come along quietly , we \'ll explain what \'s happening and- " " You \'re not part of the project . You argued against the project . " Jim saw the white flash of a reassuring smile on Conrad Oldham \'s face . " The situation changed . Eveiything will be fine once I have a chance to tell you about it . Have n\'t you missed the opportunity to speak with someone else who understands what it \'s like to be here ? We can share all that if you come along . " Oldham said the last as if expecting that would dissolve all resistance from Betty . But she shook her head .           . " It \'s critical that I give you important new information . Why else would the project have sent me back here ? " " Why would the project send someone I had no reason to trust ? " Her failure to cooperate must have perplexed Oldham , because he just repeated his earlier argument . " I \'ll explain when we \'re away from here . " " Like you explained to Paul Davidson and Charlie Bennet ? " Betty asked . Oldham did n\'t respond , seeming lost for words , and the larger one brandished his knife , dropping the pretense of comradeship . " Do it now ! " he insisted . " No ! " Oldham told the larger boy . " There \'ll be too much to remove from the records if they find- " He stopped speaking . " My body ? " Betty demanded . " Why , professor ? And who is this assassin ? " " Your only chance- " Oldham began in a conciliatory tone . " Why ? We disagreed . We argued . But murder- "           " You and those like you would n\'t listen . The answers are in scientific research and technological applications . If you tie the hands of science , then the problems will only be worse , and your project sought not just to bind science but to label it the cause of all of our problems ! Humanity ca n\'t afford that kind of solution ! " " You never listened ! " Betty shot back with the same anger . " That was never true , but all you saw was what you wanted to see . How scientific is that , professor ? " " You can twist my words any way you want , but the facts are that you would doom humanity , and I have to save it . " The large boy made a noise of derision . " Humanity is doomed . The end is upon us all , and those who would deny the will of the Almighty must be stopped . " Even in the dark Jim could see Betty \'s eyes widen . " You allied yourself with them ?           I \'d find something good to say about the devil . Churchill said that . I had access to the required equipment and that group had access to the required funding . It \'s sometimes necessary to find allies where you can . " " Allies willing to kill , you mean . To do the dirty work for you . " Betty \'s voice broke . " You murdered them ? You knew those men . How could you ... ? " Oldham looked away once more . " I did n\'t kill anyone . Neither did Gordon here . How can you murder someone in 1964 when they lived until 2039 ? That \'s a logical impossibility . " " Is that how you \'re rationalizing it ? " " They lived long , full lives , " Oldham insisted . " How can you tell me that someone who was a great-grandfather in 2039 died in 1964 ? It \'s absurd and obviously violates causality . Therefore , it did n\'t happen . " " You son of a bitch . You cold-blooded- " " Shut up           need to shut her up now , whether you want it or not , " he told Oldham . Jim launched out of his hiding place , his legs propelling him forward in a leap that brought him to Gordon before either of the other two boys realized what was happening . Gordon had just begun to turn when Jim \'s right fist punched hard into his side over the kidneys . As the large boy staggered with pain , Jim caught his knife hand and twisted the weapon free , then swung the hand and arm behind Gordon and slammed him face first into the grass , bringing his own body down on him hard enough to stun the boy and drive the wind from his lungs . Oldham was staring open-mouthed toward Jim , then one hand dove for his pocket . Before it could reach its destination , the heel of Betty \'s palm smashed into Oldham \'s nose . As he reeled backwards , both hands to his face , Betty kicked him in the groin . " I \'ve wanted to do that to you           Jim had whipped off Gordon \'s belt and was using it to hogtie him , then jumped up and went to Oldham . " Do n\'t move or I \'ll kill you , " he told Oldham , and something in his voice must have made it clear that he was n\'t bluffing because the other lay still . Pulling out his handkerchief , Jim covered his hand with it before reaching into Oldham \'s pocket and pulling out a switchblade that he tossed to one side . " Betty , " Oldham gasped . " Dr. Knox . Listen . I can help . You \'re the last , you know . Our sources inside the project gave us all the names , and we got a few more that were n\'t on the list but were obviously working with the others . It \'ll be too hard for you alone . But with my assistance perhaps you can still have a chance to succeed . Gordon did all the killing . I swear it . I did n\'t want that . Let me go and we can work           dumb enough to trust you ? " Betty asked . " You never did think much of women , did you , professor ? And since it \'s apparently escaped your own keen powers of observation , I \'ll point out that I \'m not alone . " " What are we going to do with these guys ? " Jim asked . " If we let them go , they \'ll just keep trying to get us . But we ca n\'t imprison them . " That left one ugly alternative , one that he shied from . Betty looked at him , a humorless smile slowly spreading across her face . " You \'re right . We ca n\'t imprison them . And I wo n\'t do what these two would have done to us . But these two juvenile delinquents must be runaways . And the justice system in 1964 does n\'t look kindly on criminal juvenile delinquent runaways . " She knelt , pinning the handle of Gordon \'s knife to the ground with a knee and then , wincing , drew her arm across the           cut dripping blood that she smeared across one cheek , Betty took a deep breath . Betty \'s scream , long and laden with terror , echoed through the night , bouncing off the walls of the suburban houses as lights began flaring behind windows and doors banging open throughout the neighborhood . By the time the first men arrived , some bearing handguns or improvised weapons , Betty was clinging to Jim , quivering , with tears streaming down her face . " Those two got into my room ! " she yelled , pointing at Oldham and Gordon . " They threatened me with that knife and said they were going to do . . . terrible things to me ! They said they \'d killed other kids too ! Oh , but Jim was worried about me and he came by to look at my window and saw them pulling me out , and he attacked them even though they had knives and he was sooooo brave . " Betty stopped her semi-hysterical account long enough to gaze at Jim with such feigned but fervent admiration and           have caused someone to question her story . But then some of the men were pounding Jim on the back and calling him a real man , while others were grabbing Oldham , who seemed frozen with horror , and Gordon , who was shouting out that they were all damned until someone rocked his head hack with a hard blow . The police officers who showed up were big men who did n\'t seem to worry about inflicting bruises as they handcuffed Oldham and Gordon and then bundled them into the back seat of the police car . " Runaways . Armed assault . Burglary . Kidnapping , " one of the officers said to Betty \'s father . " And , uh . . . " The officer glanced toward Betty and lowered his voice . " Attempted rape and murder . Do n\'t worry . The judge will take care of these two . They \'ll be locked up for a long time . " " Betty said they mentioned two other boys by name , " Mr. Knox said , " and boasted of having killed           the cities where the boys lived . " The police officer took the paper , then turned a very hard look on Oldham and Gordon . " Murders . If what they told your daughter is true , they \'ll never come out of prison , sir , juveniles or not . " " The smaller one is yelling something about being from the future , " the other police officer commented . " He \'s a little young to be a homicidal maniac , but you know kids these days . " " It \'s that Dr. Spock , " the first officer said . " And their music . Have you heard that \' Louie , Louie \' song ? " the second officer said as they climbed into their car . Mr. Knox offered his hand to Jim as the police drove away . " Mrs. Knox and I were a little concerned about Betty getting too serious with you , but from this night forward you \'re okay with us , son . I ca n\'t imagine a better man for my daughter . " "           down beside Betty on her porch steps . " Better than I expected . " Betty held up a large magazine . " I wrote a story about what happened with Oldham and Gordon , and I just got a letter saying this magazine \'s editor bought it . Only , instead of changing the names to protect the innocent , I used all our real names . " " What magazine - " Jim stopped when he saw the cover . " Analog Science Fact and Science Fiction ? You sold a story to John W Campbell ? " " Yeah . That \'s good , is n\'t it ? " " I ... I ... " " And , " Betty continued , " I used our names , like I said . There will be thousands of copies printed of that story . It will be in the databases . Back in 2040 , any search of past documents will ping on that story for certain because it has both of our names , and then the project \'s researchers will see Oldham \'s and Gordon \'s           " You used the real events ? " Jim asked , thumbing through the magazine quickly . " I mean , the time travel and everything ? " " Of course I did . It \'s part of getting our message out , and I had to be certain that in 2040 they \'d understand what had occurred , what had actually happened to all those other poor people who came back when I did . And I wanted them to know that James Jones is a hero . " " Betty , I didn\'t- " " Did I tell you yet that I \'m going to marry you someday , Dictionary Jones ? And we \'ll write more books and stories that contain what we want to say in ways that people today can accept , and you \'ll publish your game , and I \'ll nudge researchers to aim them in the right directions , and someday I \'ll officially be Doctor Knox again and we \'ll be conducting the research . We \'re going to do this thing . " Jim grinned at her . " Yes           that story will realize it \'s true ? Science fact , not fiction . " " I had to use what realty happened , " Betty said , pointing to the magazine . " You ca n\'t make this stuff up . " Indexing ( document details ) \n October DETECTIVE SERGEANT RIZZO PARKED his Camry in a perpendicular parking space on Bay Twenty-second Street , in the shadow of the hulking mass of Brooklyn \'s Sixty-second Precinct building . He walked around to the front entrance and , once inside , waved a greeting to the desk officer and stepped to the keyboard positioned above the radio recharger . After removing car keys from the hook marked " DET 17/22 , " Rizzo turned to leave . As an afterthought , he reached for a thin Motorola hand radio and slipped it into the outer pocket of his coat . Back on the street , he scanned the vehicles along both sides of Bay Twenty-second Street , all the cars sitting with front wheels up on the sidewalk . He spotted the gray Impala , crossed diagonally to it , and unlocked its passenger door . He rifled through the glove compartment and removed a crumpled pack of Chesterfields . With one leg in the car and the other extended outward onto the curb , he spit the Nicorette gum he had been chewing into the gutter and quickly lit a cigarette . Drawing on it deeply           " he said aloud , shaking his head sadly . A fleeting thought of his wife and the promise he had made some three weeks ago now crossed his mind . " Sorry , Jen , " he said . " I \'m doing the best I can . " Joe Rizzo was fifty-one years old , a veteran New York City cop with more than twenty-six years of service . He had lived in Brooklyn since age nine and had first met his wife , Jennifer , when they were seniors in high school . Married for over twenty-five years , Rizzo , his wife , and three daughters resided in a neat , detached brick home located within the boundaries of the Sixty-eighth Precinct in the Bay Ridge-Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn . Just as he finished the Chesterfield , the deep , rumbling sound of an engine caught his ear . Turning slightly , he watched as Detective Third Grade Priscilla Jackson swung her crimson red Harley Davidson Softail off Bath Avenue and onto Bay Twenty-second Street . She slowly nosed the bike into a spot near           kill the motor . Rizzo lit a fresh smoke and got out of the car , slamming the door behind him . " Good morning , Cil , " he said as he reached her . " Welcome to Bath Beach , the heart \' n soul of Bensonhurst . " Priscilla Jackson was a thirty-two-year-old Manhattan patrol officer and the ex-partner of Mike McQueen , Rizzo \'s last partner . She was reporting for her first day of field work as a detective third grade . While still in uniform , she had assisted Rizzo and McQueen on one of the last cases they had handled . Now Priscilla pulled the black helmet from her head , shaking out her short , straight hair . She smiled , highlighting her beauty , eyes dark and wide . " Hey , Joe , " she said , " how are you ? And I got ta tell you , brother , I just rode through this neighborhood , and I did n\'t see a whole lot of what I \'d call soul . " Rizzo laughed . " Yeah ,           you start ridin \' again ? I thought you had this thing locked up in a garage somewheres . " Priscilla swung a long leg over the rear bobtail fender , dismounting . " Yeah , well , I did . When I was renting over in Bed-Sty . But me and Karen have a place together now on East Thirty-ninth Street . A bike is a lot easier to deal with in the city . Karen keeps her Lexus garaged and it costs more than my old apartment rent did . " Rizzo stepped slowly around the Harley , examining it . " Nice lookin \' bike , " he said , expelling smoke . " Looks fast . " Priscilla shrugged . " It \'s not a pig , but it ai n\'t a real hot rod , either . Fourteen-fifty cc motor . I spent a lot on doodads , like the Badlander seat and the drag bar on that high riser . The bullet headlight cost me a fortune . But do n\'t it look cool ? " Rizzo nodded . " Yeah . Cool .           enough . " " Whatever floats your boat , Partner , " she replied with a laugh . " So , shall we go in and meet the boys and girls ? Get this shit over with ? " Now it was Rizzo who laughed . " Sounds good . It \'ll be nice to have a steady partner again -- that bouncin \' around filling in for guys on sick or annual leave really screwed up my stats . I \'d hate to end my stellar career on a downturn . I was planning on doing about six more months , but I think a year is more like it . I recrunched the numbers : a year from now , I \'ll be about maxed out , pension-wise . " Priscilla smiled broadly . " So I get a year out of you , same as Mike did . Maybe I \'ll get over to One Police Plaza like he did , too . " Rizzo tossed away his cigarette . " Not likely . That was a freak thing . Someday I \'ll tell you all about           that gold shield . " Priscilla nodded , a serious look entering her eyes . " Well , I do n\'t need to know all about that , Joe . I just know I owe you . Big time . The bump-up to detective pay let me do this move-in with Karen . At least now I can half-ass carry my weight with the finances . Thanks to you . " " You earned that shield . If it was n\'t for your help , me and Mike would still be lookin \' for Councilman Daily \'s runaway kid . All I did was make a call and explain that to him . Daily did the rest . The hacks over at the Plaza musta tripped over their own shlongs getting you that promotion so they could kiss up to him a little more . " Rizzo \'s voice had hardened as he spoke . After a moment he went on , his tone once again conversational . " Besides , you \'re gon na be my sharp young partner , helping me get my stats back up . Then           couple a years cookin \' dinner for Jen till she retires and we move to Drop Dead Acres in Florida somewheres . " Rizzo reached up and tapped his temple . " I got a plan . " " You \'ll miss the job , Joe . You just wo n\'t admit it . " " Yeah , I guess . But it sure has changed . Twenty-seven years ago , you told me I \'d have a black female partner in the Six-Two , I\'da told you , no way . \' And here we are . " " Not to mention a gay black female , " Priscilla said , her eyes twinkling . " Oh , we always had gays , Cil , " Rizzo replied . " Not open , maybe , but we always had them . Women and men . " Priscilla nodded . " Damn right , " she said . " But the job \'s changed in bad ways , too . It used to be like a family . One big family . Now ... well , maybe we got a           holiday meals . You know what I mean ? " Priscilla reached out and patted his shoulder . " Yeah , Grandpa . The good old days . I got it . Now let \'s go sign in . And I \'m feeling a little hungry . Do detectives start the day tour with breakfast , or is that just uniforms ? " " Cil , we start every tour with breakfast . C\'m on , I \'ll introduce you to the boss , then we \'ll get going . " * * * RIZZO SIPPED at his coffee , rereading the blurry copy of the precinct fax he held . The two detectives were seated at a rear booth of Rizzo \'s favorite diner awaiting their meals . " Son-of-a-fuckin \' -bitch , " he mumbled . Priscilla looked at him over the rim of her mug . " Damn , Joe , readin \' it over and over ai n\'t going to change what it says . " Rizzo compressed his lips . The fax had come from Personnel Headquarters at Police Plaza , addressed to all members           city . The police recruitment civil service exam scheduled for early November would result in expedited hiring . Due to an unusually large number of impending retirements , anyone successfully completing the exam could reasonably expect to be hired within six to nine months as opposed to the usual fifteen- to twenty-four-month window . " This is exactly what I did n\'t need , " Rizzo said . " My youngest daughter is taking this friggin \' test . In six months , she \'ll have enough college credits to get appointed . I was figurin \' on a hell of a lot more time to talk her out of it . This jams me up real good . My wife is gon na freak on this . " They sat silently as the waitress delivered their meals . When she left , Priscilla spoke . " Do n\'t you have three girls ? " she asked . Rizzo nodded . " Yeah , Carol \'s the baby . She \'s almost twenty , a sophomore at Stony Brook . Marie is my oldest , she \'s twenty-four . She           She graduates from Hunter College in June . " Priscilla buttered her toast and winced . " What a tuition nut to crack , " she said . " I ca n\'t even dent it , let alone crack it . Everybody is borrowed to the balls . " " Well , " Priscilla said , " you got ta figure one of them for the job , Joe . They \'re all a cop \'s kid . " Rizzo shook his head . " Bullshit . I told you , the job \'s changed too much . For the worse . These kids , all starry-eyed , gon na save the world . Ends bad for most of them . You know that . " She shrugged . " It is what it is , " she said . " You make it work for you if you got the balls . " Rizzo leaned forward and spoke softly . " Let \'s just drop it , okay ? This ai n\'t your problem . " Priscilla smiled . " Whatever you say , boss . My lips are           , discussing their individual relationships with Mike McQueen , who had partnered with both of them at different times , and what Priscilla might expect in Brooklyn . " In case you have n\'t noticed , " Rizzo said with a smile , " this ai n\'t exactly that Upper East Side silk stocking house where you worked uniform . " " I noticed that as soon as I pulled my bike offa the Belt Parkway and hit the streets . Now , " she continued , taking a last sip of coffee and patting her lips dry with a paper napkin , " let \'s go do what we \'re supposed to be doin \' : cruising the precinct , getting the lay of the land . I \'m anxious to start raisin \' those stats of yours , Mr. Legend . " Priscilla stood , stretching out her back muscles . " Let \'s go , " she said again . They left the diner , pausing outside for Rizzo to have a quick cigarette . Priscilla had made it clear : no smoking in the car .           with that crap you smoke , " she told Rizzo . Rizzo had her take the wheel . As she started the Impala , he reached under the front seat , pulling out a bottle of green mint Listerine . Priscilla watched as he raised the bottle to his lips , swishing the liquid around in his mouth , then opening the door slightly and spitting into the gutter . When he was done , he replaced the bottle , then shifted in his seat and pulled on his shoulder harness . Feeling Priscilla \'s eyes on him , Rizzo turned to face her . Seeing her expression , he frowned . " What ? " he asked . " What ? You asking me what ? What the fuck did I just see ? You got a date , Joe ? " He shook his head . " No . Jen thinks I quit . If I gargle after every couple a smokes , my breath wo n\'t smell when I get home tonight . That \'s all . " Priscilla shook her head and glanced into the mirrors           , Joe . Cops ridin \' this car next shift find that bottle under the seat , they \'re gon na figure I \'m givin \' up some head for that shield you got me . Do n\'t leave that shit there . Please . " He chuckled . " It \'s been awhile since I worked with a dame , " he answered with a smile . " I forgot how all of you think . " " Besides , " Priscilla said , " Jen is n\'t stupid . You come home all minty-breath , your clothes smelling like horse shit , she probably knows exactly what \'s going on . " " You could be right , " he said with a shrug . They spent the next two hours cruising the varied areas of the Sixty-second Precinct , from the bustling , thriving commercial strips of Eighteenth and Thirteenth Avenues , Eighty-sixth Street and Bay Parkway , to the nestled residential blocks , tree-lined and glistening under the October sunshine . Rizzo pointed out the trouble-spot bars and social clubs , the after-hours mob joints and           Utrecht Avenue , he pointed to a grimy , antiquated storefront , its plate-glass windows opaque with green paint . " The Blackball Poolroom , " he said . " It \'s nineteen fifty-eight inside there , Cil . Totally . " He showed her sprawling Dyker Park , with its adjacent golf course , and pointed out the bocce , basketball , and tennis courts . There multiple generations of neighborhood residents played their distinct games with equal intensity . As they cruised slowly along Nineteenth Avenue on their way back to the precinct , Priscilla slowed the car for a red light . Rizzo reached across and lightly touched her arm . When she turned to face him , he pointed diagonally across the intersection . " Take a good look at that guy and remember him . The tall kid wearing the Giants cap and black coat . That there \'s Joey DeMarco , seventeen years old , future serial killer . About once or twice a year the house gets a call . This guy lures stray cats with food . Then he douses \' em           run like hell , squealing like banshees . Usually they die in midstride . Time the uniforms get there , the thing is stiff and charred like charcoal . God only knows how many times he \'s done it and never got caught . He \'s a real sadistic little prick . So far he has n\'t grabbed some kid or old lady to kill , but mark my words , it \'s coming . " Priscilla glanced up as the light turned green , and she eased the car forward . " Why \'s he still out free , roamin \' with the citizens ? " she asked . Rizzo shrugged . " Why you think ? Every time they lock him up , he gets psyched over to Kings County Hospital G Building . The geniuses over there drug him and squeeze Medicaid , or insurance or whatever , dry for thirty days . Then they pronounce him cured , and he walks . The charges get dismissed , and Joey starts savin \' his nickels to buy some more Ronson . And , of course , Mommy           just our cruel society victimizing their little shit . " Priscilla studied DeMarco as they drove past him . " Duly noted , " she said . Rizzo fumbled through his jacket pocket and produced a packet of Nicorette . " See , that \'s what I mean , " he said as he began to wrestle with the packaging . " How the job \'s changed . Years ago , a kid like that , if he torched a cat , a sector car would grab him and break his fuckin \' arm . After that , he \'d either knock it off or go do it somewheres out of the precinct . But not anymore . Those days are gone . " Priscilla smiled . " There is something to be said for the old-fashioned corrective interview , that \'s for sure , " she said . " Damn right , " he mumbled , at last freeing the gum and popping it into his mouth . " Joe , " Priscilla said gently , " I never smoked a day in my life , but even I           the weed . You ca n\'t do both . That nicotine is poison , brother . They spray it on crops to kill insects . " Rizzo chewed slowly . " Well , " he said with a small smile . " Fuck it . Something \'s got ta kill ya . Might as well be chewin \' gum . " \n London , January 1803 . " Ow ! Nicholas , I need another bandage . " Marguerite \'s husband rushed into the workroom with a bundle of muslin strips . " You \'ve hurt yourself again ? I \'m going to send those new carving tools into the Thames . This is the third time this week a knife has slipped in your hands . " " I know . And look what happened . " Marguerite held up her latest creation , a fashion doll commissioned by a local dressmaker who intended to show off a new ball-gown design on it for several of her select clients . But the doll \'s head would have to be redone , as there was now a deep gash across the left side of its face . " Why do n\'t you let Roger handle the carving ? " Nicholas asked . " I probably should , but I \'m so frustrated with trying to perfect wax heads that I wanted to retreat back to the familiarity of working with wood . I \'m good at that . At least , I used to be . " She held up her           beginning to seep blood . Nicholas put his arms around his young wife and lifted her up onto the large worktable , which was littered with scraps of fabric , bundles of straw , blocks of wood , and other materials of the trade . " Sweetheart , you are the best dollmaker in London . Wax is still a new medium . I \'ve no doubt you will eventually be the best wax dollmaker in all of Europe . " " I \'ll never be as good as Aunt Claudette . " " No , you \'ll never be your aunt Claudette . " He wrapped his arms around his wife and kissed the tip of her nose . " Much to my great relief . I could n\'t bear to be married to a woman of lesser talent than you . " " Mr. Ashby , you \'re very fortunate that I am of such a forgiving nature that I can overlook your insult to my beloved aunt and mentor . Otherwise , I might be forced to employ my shrewish tone of voice . " " Is           like in her natural state ? " He scooped her off the worktable and cupped one hand around the back of her neck while using the other to pull her thick auburn hair out of the knot she employed to keep it out of her face while working . It slid down her back like the flow of warm brandy from a decanter . " Now I remember the fair young maiden I fell in love with at Hevington a decade ago . She was covered in wood shavings even back then . " Bells jangled as someone entered the front door . Marguerite disengaged from her husband \'s embrace and went from the back workroom out to the front of the shop . It was Agnes Smoot , returning from an errand . " Letter just come for you , Mrs. Ashby . " Marguerite took the proffered folded square from the shop \'s seamstress with her unhurt hand . " Thank you , Agnes . Has Roger returned yet from making deliveries ? " " No , mum , not yet . D\' you want to see him           \'m sure he does n\'t want to hear of my epic battle with a carving knife . " She held up her bandaged thumb . " Again , mum ? " " Yes , again , unfortunately . " Marguerite returned to the workroom where Nicholas was busy arranging some scraps of wood according to size , while whistling softly under his breath . She held up the sealed correspondence . " Speaking of Aunt Claudette , I have a letter from her . Would you like to read it with me ? " Nicholas stopped what he was doing and lit a small lamp to better illuminate the letter . Claudette Greycliffe \'s writing tended to be faint and spidery , and it could take them an entire evening to decipher her longer missives . January 15 , 1803 Hevington , Kent My dearest Marguerite , I trust all is well with you and that you are capably managing the recent influx of orders for the Season . Are the troubles with France affecting your ability to obtain supplies ? I expect old Boney wo n\'t be letting any           dear . Sometimes I get lonely for the excitement of the shop . Send along a project for me , will you ? I should love to wield a knife again . It feels like an eternity since I held a block of wood in my hand . William and I send our love to both you and Nicholas . Will you be coming to visit soon ? Little Bitty is dying to show you her new cat that she found hiding under some shrubbery . It \'s a mangy thing -- one eye missing , an ear clipped , and its tail bent horribly out of shape -- but Little Bitty carries the thing with her everywhere . I believe this new addition to the family makes the animal-to-child ratio at Hevington nearly two to one . William says the family estate is being turned into a wildlife menagerie . I have n\'t the heart to tell him yet that I have my eye on one of those new bullmastiffs that are becoming popular . They are supposed to be very good guard dogs , but I suppose that           will become spoilt and lazy . With my greatest affection , Claudette P.S. Why do n\'t you come for a week or so next month ? William wants to teach the children blindman \'s bluff , and you certainly do n\'t want to miss that spectacle . " Aunt Claudette sounds a little lonely , Nicholas . " " Lonely ! How could she have time to be lonely ? She manages a careful and virtuous household , contains three noisy and active children , and hosts numerous fashionable parties , yet the woman is still inexplicably graceful . No wonder Uncle William adores her . " " Why , you foolish man ! Not ten minutes ago you were glad I was n\'t Aunt Claudette . " Claudette Laurent , the daughter of a great French dollmaker , had been orphaned in France at the age of sixteen , but found ship \'s passage to England and worked as a domestic servant for several years under a harsh mistress before finally risking all to start her own doll shop . Marguerite \'s widowed mother , Biatrice du Georges ,           England and so , along with five-year-old Marguerite , the three had lived , worked , and survived together . Although her mother had been involved in the shop , it was the young Marguerite who had shown a talent for dollmaking . Claudette encouraged her interest and the two became close , with Marguerite referring to the older woman as " Aunt " Claudette . William Greycliffe was a man of minor aristocratic connections who had pursued Claudette relentlessly despite her initial disdain of him . Even now Marguerite loved to hear stories of their courtship told for the thousandth time . When Biatrice died suddenly , Claudette and William brought the teenaged Marguerite to live with them at their Kentish estate of Hevington and Claudette made Marguerite her de facto heir in the doll shop . As time passed , Claudette turned more and more of the responsibility for the shop over to Marguerite as she became involved in raising her three children and managing the estate with William . Nicholas was one of a set of twin boys born to James and Maude Ashby , Claudette \'s           . Nicholas \'s heart burned with youthful passion for Biatrice , who gently refused him . He avidly followed the women \'s progress after they left the Ashby home and even visited on occasion . Following Biatrice \'s death , Nicholas finally took note of Marguerite and promptly fell in love with her saucy temperament . For Marguerite , Nicholas filled the need for gentle sweetness that her mother \'s death had yanked away from her , and the two had been inseparable during the intervening ten years . " Oh , Nicholas , let \'s go for Shrovetide as Aunt Claudette suggests . We have n\'t been to Hevington in months . We even missed the lighting of the Yule log this past year . Besides , Rebecca is probably old enough now for a baby house and we could take one to her as a gift . " In the coziness of the warmly lit workshop , full of the smell of freshly shaved wood , she reached her arms around her husband \'s neck and pressed her lips to his . He responded in his familiar way           face in her neck . " Very well , Mrs. Ashby . We \'ll leave the shop in the care of Roger and Agnes , and plan for a long visit to Hevington . But before you begin packing trunks , I believe there is some more immediate business that requires your attention , " he said , gently dropping kisses along her exposed neckline . " Is that so , Mr. Ashby ? Pray , what business could be of such consequence that it calls for my immediate attention ? " " It \'s a very private matter . Come home now , woman , so we can , er , discuss it before it loses the strength of its importance . " He playfully smacked his wife \'s bottom and ushered her out of the shop , humming a happy but aimless tune . February 21 , 1803 . The evening before their scheduled departure for Hevington , Marguerite and Nicholas returned to the closed doll shop so she could put together a small box of miniature furniture and other accoutrements for the baby house they had already           Miniature dolls \' houses , called baby houses , were becoming increasingly popular in England . Claudette had once spoken wistfully about the houses her father carried in his doll shop back in France , which led to an expansion in her own shop \'s trade in these diminutive pieces . In addition to offering miniature replicas of tables , chairs , beds , carpets , paintings , and dishes , Marguerite had started designing tiny scale-sized families to inhabit them . She rummaged patiently through a box of petite tissue-wrapped dolls , searching for one painted with Rebecca \'s cobalt eyes , eyes that defined her as her mother \'s child . " Marguerite , the hackney will not wait all night for us . Is n\'t the house and its furnishings enough for one child ? " " I suppose so , but I know I painted a baby-house doll that resembles her . I want her to have it . Maybe in this drawer ? No , not here . I should look on the fabric shelves . Nicholas , would you go back to the workroom           baby-house dolls ? " While Nicholas retreated to the back of the shop , she continued her search , the sound of her husband \'s gentle whistling floating high over the tops of shelves loaded with every manner of elegantly dressed doll . Marguerite \'s stock ranged from the little babyhouse dolls all the way up to the grandes Pandores , life-sized dolls built on metal frames , which Aunt Claudette had made popular among the aristocratic English . The grandes Pandores were Claudette \'s favorite dolls , but Marguerite preferred the nimble skill involved in the tiniest of her creations . Besides , the grandes Pandores required the wax heads that were so dratted difficult to create as flawless pieces . A distant shouting from outside overtook the comforting sound of Nicholas \'s whistling . She paused from what she was doing to listen , but the noise abated and she returned to her task . Nicholas returned to the display room at the front of the shop . " Sweetheart , there are no baby-house dolls in the workroom . I \'ll go up to the attic and           " " And I \'ll continue looking down here . I \'m just certain that we have more of these dolls in the shop . " Nicholas Ashby \'s tall but lanky frame disappeared from view again . He had grown in height as he became an adult , but had never filled out in an obviously muscular sort of way . Still he had the strength of two men , and Marguerite loved watching him haul large planks of wood from delivery wagons into the shed behind the shop . Even Roger , as enormous and barrel-chested as he was , could not out-lift Nicholas Ashby . But Nicholas \'s interest in the shop stopped with physical duties . He was content to let Marguerite deal with customers and manage the financial affairs of the shop , much as her mother had been happy to let Aunt Claudette do years ago . So engrossed was she with her thoughts and her search that when the projectile came through the window on the other side of the shop she was at first confused as to whether the sound had come           on the street settled her confusion . " Nicholas ? Nicholas ! Come quickly ! " Marguerite called up toward the attic entrance , but he did not answer . He must have gone into the far reaches of the attic , which spanned the forty-foot length of the shop . She stood up , brushing dust from the sturdy , brown woolen skirt she wore most days when working . Ever brash as a child and no less so as a woman , Marguerite marched to the front door of the shop and flung it open . The hackney was gone , and she was stunned to see a group of about twenty men , mostly drunk and on the brink of irrationality . They carried torches and clubs and the occasional pitchfork , and were gabbing loudly about a hanging at Southwark . Why were these drunkards marching on respectable Oxford Street , and why in heaven \'s name were they congregating outside her shop with obvious ill will ? " That \'s her , Mr. Emmett . She \'s the doll lady we told you about ,           torches Marguerite could not see individual faces well , but the voice was coming from the back of the assembly . " Yes , I have that figured out , Reggie . Your assistance is appreciated . " A man who could have been one of any number of different merchants stepped forward so that Marguerite could see him . He was as short as Nicholas was tall but built like a bull . He swept an exaggerated bow . " Mr. Emmett at your service , mistress . " " Yes , I have that figured out , Mr. Emmett . " Hoots of laughter were interspersed with calls for Mr. Emmett to " get to it . " " Well now , mistress , we \'ve just heard some disturbing news . News that might have a serious impact on your little trade here . " " News ? What news ? " Reggie \'s voice rang out again . " She \'s a liar , Mr. Emmett . She knows all about it ! " The other men grumbled their agreement . Marguerite stared steadily at Mr.           " Hurry up with what you have to say so I can be about my business . I \'m a law-abiding woman running an honorable shop with her husband . " " Is that right ? " Mr. Emmett stepped closer and his frame filled the doorway . Up close , Marguerite could see that his eyes were bloodshot from drink and hidden rage , and he stank of a laborer \'s sweat . She calculated whether or not to scream for Nicholas but was unsure whether he would hear her , and as of yet she was not sure what might infuriate these men further . " So is your husband here right now , mistress ? " Mr. Emmett \'s gaze was thoughtful . " He is . Shall I get him for you ? " " She \'s still lying , Mr. Emmett ! Ai n\'t no one else here except probably some spies hiding out . " Mr. Emmett \'s darting eyes spoke his indecision over whom to believe . " C\'m on , Mr. Emmett , are we going to do what we came here           \'ve a powerful thirst . " Marguerite maintained her own gaze . " And what did you come here for ? " " We \'re here to put a stop to the French intrigues coming in through Ireland , and that would include Colonel Despard and his bunch , plus all the French rabble like you . " " What French rabble ? I \'m an Englishwoman . Who is Colonel Despard ? " Marguerite was trying desperately to figure out what he was talking about . " Not with a fancy name like Marguerite you \'re not . A good Englishwoman would be Margaret or Margery . Your name has you dead to rights a lady Frog . " Marguerite drew in a breath in an attempt to be patient . What was taking Nicholas so long in the attic ? " My mother was French . I have lived in this country all my life and am married to an Englishman . What is this nonsense about French infiltration through Ireland ? " " Ever since the French peasants started their revolution , the Irish have been hoping           Stinking papists the French and Irish are . They \'ve been looking for a way to bring down the right noble house of Hanover so they could bring in French rule and turn us all into foppin \' Frogs . So they found a half-wit in Colonel Despard to do their work . He stole over here from Ireland slippery as an eel and planned to kill our good King George . But the Irish and French are no match for smart Englishmen and he was found out . So today we all went and watched him and his gang swing from the gallows and get their heads chopped off , and now we \'re going to help out the Crown by getting rid of the rest of the French influence in England , starting with you , Mrs. Marguerite Ashby . We know all about this shop \'s wicked dealings . " ( Continues ... ) \n STELLAFANE 1990 The astronomer \'s wife is on her knees in the garden , facing away from him , stabbing at the soil with a silver trowel , her head covered with a big straw gardener \'s hat that is in fact a thrift- store sombrero whose dangly felt pompoms she long ago snipped off . During the winter when the garden is mostly dormant the mutilated sombrero lives on a hook in the laundry room , and it is one of the trusty signs of spring that Patsy has taken it down and pulled its little beaded cinch snug around her jaw and bulled her way out into the yard in just a track suit , despite Clyde \'s mild suggestions that it might be too early . Clyde is a sort of worrier , it must be said , but not so much that he is moved to go outside to help her . Besides , he gets cold easily now ( he is eighty-four ) and the cartilage in his knees is mostly gone , so that from time to time through the usual ache will come a spike of pain , always accompanied by the           Instead he watches her from the kitchen table , where he is sitting with a glass of water and a small , colorful arrangement of pebbly pills , as bright as aquarium gravel , and with the afternoon \'s mail stacked in front of him . Their kitchen is dark , paneled in fake pine , and the appliances are the avocado green that was once stylish but which is now a source of cringing embarrassment to their daughter , Jean , who can not help herself from picking at the Formica countertops when she comes to visit . " It \'s so dingy , " she tells them , but Clyde ca n\'t see it . Well : does n\'t care . He finds his kitchen fine as it is . From his seat he can see the garden and the neighbor \'s high paling fence threaded with the mean whips of bougainvillea and the giant primary-blue sky of March in New Mexico . And he can keep an eye on Patsy , in case she needs him . He makes his way through the mail , pressing out           at a time , from the checkbook , keeping the balance in the register as he goes and setting the used envelopes aside to serve , later , once they have been scissored into squares , as scratch paper for telephone messages . ( This also drives Jean around the bend , her father \'s habitual and unnecessary and , it seems , aggressive frugality . In private Clyde admits to himself that he takes some goading pleasure in what it produces in Jean , her dependable fury , her outraged sadness at her fading parents -- well , it is what they have between them , it is better than nothing . ) The mail is bills and advertisements and nothing unusual ; and then , like the prize in a box of Cracker Jack , at the bottom of the stack of mail he finds an invitation to speak at Stellafane , a society of amateur telescope makers , who convene an annual meeting in Vermont . He is still occasionally invited to things like this , but since most people suppose he is dead it does not           is for July . He goes out into the garden , holding the letter , bright in the sun . " Well , " Patsy tells him , " that \'s very nice . " " I think I \'m going to go . " " All right . " She settles back on her haunches . " You ought to find somebody to travel with . " " You could come . " " Pfah . Not on your life . That crew . " She means the enthusiasts and hobbyists who have made such a pet of her husband over the years . It is not jealousy but its opposite , the conviction they do not appreciate him sufficiently . Clyde likes this position , secretly shares it , and makes a feeble show of pretending otherwise . " What about Sarah ? " she suggests . " Well -- if she \'d want to . " " She might . " She drives her trowel into the crunching soil . " Help me up , " she says , and extends an arm . " We \'ll           their only grandchild . In 1990 she is twenty- two , having graduated the previous spring from Indiana University in Bloomington . She is still living in Bloomington , working in the IU botany lab studying grains and grasses . As it turns out she is pleased to travel with her grandfather , of whom she is simply and excellently fond . Besides seeming to like him for himself , she is of the opinion that having Clyde Tombaugh as her grandfather is a cool and incidentally useful thing . When she is out to impress a boy or make herself feel better about something , she has him to resort to , the story of Planet X. Clyde enjoys holding this position in Sarah \'s life , which feels like something resembling his due . His granddaughter does n\'t know the whole story , of course , which is just as well . For certain reasons of his own , he has never told her the whole story . For that matter he has never told Patsy the whole story either . Or anyone . Sarah arrives in Albuquerque           in parts : she has his narrow shoulders , his blunt squarish head smoothly indented in places like a salt lick , his very white skin cool to the touch . All her own is the knowing stance , the tilt of the head down and to the side , and with this a habit of observing you through her hair with an air of tolerant skepticism . What in her mother is harried and punishing is in Sarah set back and noncommittal . But when she smoothes her hair from her forehead and puts it behind her sizable ears , you can be sure she is about to tell you something you do n\'t necessarily want to hear . You ca n\'t fool Sarah . On the flight to Boston , Clyde has the window seat and Sarah sits beside him . She has a new boyfriend , she informs him : Dave , a graduate student in the Indiana music conservatory . " Guess what instrument . " " Piano , " Clyde says . " No . " " I wanted to learn the piano once ,           " Flute . " " No . " " Triangle , " Clyde says . " No . " She bats him . " He \'s not gay . " " Well , I do n\'t know . Guitar . " " Tuba ! " She leans away from him , grimacing , horrified . " Can you believe that ? What \'s wrong with him ? " " Somebody has to play it . " " Not necessarily . I went to a recital and he played a piece called something like Dance for Three Tubas . He could n\'t find two other people in the world who played tuba , I guess , so he played the other two parts himself and taped them and then played the last part live on stage ! By himself ! " " There must be other tuba players in the music school . " She hefts herself upright . " I do n\'t know . He has to lug the thing around with him everywhere , in that giant case . It \'s like having the most enormous dog . "           that Patsy would want to know he asks , " So , do you like him ? " " Oh , I love him . " She grins . " He \'s ridiculous . He has a little tiny Honda Civic that he rides around in with his great big tuba . And , " she finishes , " he \'s from Canada . " The talk he will give at Stellafane is the same one , really , that he has always given , amended marginally to account for differing audiences . The version he has written out for this trip is for the telescope makers , the tinkerers . They can not really imagine what it was like to grind a nine-inch mirror themselves , in the middle of Kansas , in 1928 , with the materials he had at hand . But he wants to give them a little bit of an idea . " Read my talk , " he says to Sarah . He tugs the pages from his satchel and hands them across to her . It is handwritten in his tidy blue script           . When she finishes she says , " I always forget how young you were . " " Twenty-two , " he says . Then , realizing it : " As old as you are , in fact . " She hands him the papers . " I guess that makes me a dud . " " Well , that \'s -- " He shakes his head . It is too wrong for words . " No . " " No , I \'m sort of , you know -- joking . Sort of ! Maybe . I do n\'t know . I \'m just -- " She reaches into her own satchel and tugs out a Walkman . She unwinds the cord from the earphones , inserts the jack into the tape player , and places the earphones over his ears . She presses play . He hears tuba music , oomphing and bumbling , elephants in tutus . Her face is alive with embarrassed delight . " Is n\'t that ridiculous , " she says . By the time they land in Boston his knees are so sore           only slightly humiliating to be wheeled by his granddaughter through the terminal . This nice girl is mine , he wants to crow . He satisfies himself with the envying glances of other fogies in their chairs , pushed by indifferent airport workers in untucked blue shirts , name tags flapping . No one will spill him onto the concourse linoleum like a sack of potatoes . They rent a car and head north , away from the rosy brick-and-glass towers of Boston , north through Massachusetts and into New Hampshire . Sarah drives while Clyde watches the countryside . He has never been to New Hampshire , and he is pleased to see that it looks more or less as he has imagined it . It is late afternoon , warm , verging on evening , and the orange summer light leans over fieldstone barns and farmhouses until these give way in turn to long stretches of silent dark forest . The road is narrow , the painted lines nearly worn away . A first star comes out : Deneb , bright point of the summer triangle . The           over the Vermont border , a little encampment in the woods . A sign at the gate reads please only parking lights after dark . They creep up the dirt road , under the pine trees , then emerge onto an open hillside under the stars . Dozens , hundreds of people , it would seem : red- capped flashlights are bobbing everywhere . At the top of the hill stands a timbered house , pink in the glow of their parking lights . " That \'s where we \'re supposed to check in , " he says . " You sit , " Sarah insists , and hops out and prances around the front fender and disappears inside . There is a flash of light , a glimpse of a desk , a bulletin board pinned with papers . A minute later she emerges with a bearded , wild-haired man , exactly the sort Patsy dislikes , in a dark T-shirt and pale shorts and tennis shoes and a beer gut . This man puts his hands on his thighs for support and peers into the car . "           Mike Cornish . " " Yes . Hello . " " It \'s an honor , sir , to finally meet you . " They shake hands . He does like hearing this . " Thank you for the invitation . " " Well , it \'s about time we had you here , is n\'t it ? " Clyde answers , " I should say so . " Mike Cornish grins through his beard , showing a giant \'s gappy choppers . " You \'re in the founder \'s cabin . We \'ll bring you some breakfast tomorrow morning around ten o\'clock . If there \'s anything you need , I \'ll be here for a little while and then I \'ll be over on the hill . But there \'ll be somebody at the desk all night . " " When do I speak ? " " After breakfast . Around eleven , all right ? " The cabin turns out to be a cedar A-frame , down another dirt road and under the pine trees again . Sarah hefts their bags from the car , arranges everything           a loft up a spiral staircase . " I \'ll arm-wrestle you for it , " she tells him . " No thank you . " He sinks into the armchair . So much travel has unsettled his bones ; he still feels the plane swaying beneath him , the thrumming of the tarry seams in the old highway . He is not surprised to note a hippyish air to the cabin : knotty pine walls and Navaho rugs -- imitations , he sees at a glance . The fluorescent light from the entryway lays a cool green light over everything . He misses home , where he would now be napping in the corduroy armchair in front of the television . But he will not complain . He is a guest . He is being paid . It is work . " I hope this is all right , " he calls up to Sarah . She pops her head over the railing . " It \'s so cool . I \'m going to change and go out and look around . I saw people with their telescopes out           going to rest , " he says . " But you \'re their hero , " she smiles . A minute later she comes bumping down the stairs in a puffy blue parka and gray fingerless gloves . She has washed her face , and there is something clarified , uncomplicated , in her examination of him . She gestures : " So -- I \'ll just be out there somewhere if you need me . " " Watch out for oddballs . " " Takes one to know one , " she answers . When she is gone he goes to the phone . He is surprised to find a dial tone . He calls Patsy . " You \'re alive , " she remarks . " Are you bothering Sarah ? " " Not much , I guess , " he says . " She told me about this new boyfriend . " " Dave ? Dave \'s not new . Dave \'s been in the picture for -- oh , at least a year , it must be . " " Well , I \'ve never heard           \'s the musician . " " The tuba player ? " " Well , that \'s him . I do n\'t know , Clyde . You \'ve heard of him before . " There is something unmoored in her voice . Clyde misses her , worries over her . It is hard to be apart . " Is it cold there ? " she asks . " It \'s all right , " he answers . " It \'s nice here , but I did n\'t go out at all . I just lay around like I was no good . I just hate it when you go away . " She sighs . " You know , I get all weedy . " When Sarah comes in a few hours later Clyde is in bed , not quite asleep . But for her sake he lies still while she washes and climbs the creaking spiral stairs to the loft . It rains that night , and a piney campground smell leaks around the aluminum window frame above Clyde \'s big iron bed . He wakes to the old sound           while , just enjoying the sound . A farmer \'s son , he never loses interest in such things . And it rains so rarely in Albuquerque . He buries himself deep beneath the knotted quilt with a sigh of sudden happiness . He misses Patsy , but it pleases him to have a bed of his own , a little camp bed under a slanted ceiling and the crinkling sound of the baseboard radiators expanding and contracting . It reminds him -- oh , faintly -- of his boyhood home . That vanished white room at the end of the hall -- About ten years ago Patsy got sick and went to the hospital and he was alone in their bed for weeks , which was entirely different . Silent , terrible nights , when they thought they were going to lose her . He turns from this , listening to the rain again . He sleeps long and late , and the next morning he eats the delivered breakfast : eggs , toast , coffee in a carafe , sausages , bacon , all things he really should           Coffee is especially forbidden . As Sarah thumps down the stairs he stops himself like a dog caught with a roast . But she fl umps herself into a chair , not noticing , not knowing what the rules are . " I had a dream I was watching this parade , " she tells him . " And there was this sort of tow truck , and it was pulling this big , uh , sort of a house , and the idea was you were supposed to see how people lived in the house , it was the parade of How to Live . " He will have just a little more coffee . " I have the most obvious dreams , " she says . " Like I \'m in third grade . Oh , man , by the way , you should see some of these telescopes they have . Until it got cloudy it was amazing . I saw Saturn , I saw Jupiter and all the little moons . And also , by the way , everybody ca n\'t wait to hear you .           are totally a myth and a legend to them and you know it . Seriously , it was like being a princess in disguise . " " The Princess of Pluto . " She grins , points a strip of bacon at him . She is too pleased , she can hardly bear it ; she flushes into her plate . As for Clyde , he urinates six times in half an hour , and then his face goes a little numb and his hands start shaking , so much that he draws blood shaving under his big flat chin . When they go out a little while later to walk up the road to the main camp there is still a scraped irritation . And his knees are pretty bad this morning , after all that sitting yesterday , so it is a slow trip , a quarter mile ; but he wants to walk it . It is more dignified . When they reach the top of the hill , they observe that the timbered main house is in fact pink , as it had appeared last night           in darkness : a long green slope hemmed at the bottom and at either side with great trees ; and on the hillside an array of tents , and at the very bottom of the hill a small wooden stage and a lectern . And hundreds of people , stirring around their tents . " Your people , " Sarah whispers . He has to pee again in the pink house , the offices of Stellafane ; he shakes a few shy hands on his way in and out , and then he spends twenty minutes or so making his way down the hillside through the mob of campers . He shakes more hands . He signs things : old photographs of himself that he exclaims at ; what appear to be photocopied announcements of the discovery of Planet X from the Harvard College Observatory ; photographs of Lowell Observatory -- and also maps of Vermont , and dollar bills , and chewing gum wrappers , he goes from one to the next , his signature always perfectly legible because it is never otherwise . Sarah walks with him ,           , hovering nearby when he is thronged . He is cold , he notices absently , but he is too busy to really pay attention ; he has his windbreaker on , and his khaki pants , and his comfortable brown shoes , and people are making a fuss over him . Well , he likes it . At the bottom of the hill Mike Cornish greets him . " You sit here , " he orders , and Clyde sinks into a folding chair on the grass beside the little stage . He plunges his hands into the linty pockets of his windbreaker and shivers once . His granddaughter is sitting on the grass a ways up the hill ; she sends him a sporty little wave . The four legs of Clyde \'s folding chair do not all meet the grass at once , so he finds himself rocking slowly from one triplet of legs to another as Mike Cornish begins the introduction , the story as it is known , in outline : the years in Kansas as a boy , making his own telescopes . The           with only a high school degree . There , the endless starfields to be compared . And at last the discovery . Clyde listens with pleasure ; but something odd is beginning to happen to him , possibly having to do with the coffee . There is a feeling of peculiar displacement , of being relocated somehow -- that he is being gently separated from his own body . Possibly he is having a heart attack . He finds , in the afterglow of all the attention , and after that excellent , illegal breakfast , that he does n\'t really mind . It is as good a place to die as any . Patsy will make it all right without him . He has left the checkbook balanced , anyway . Then Cornish finishes , and Clyde is still alive , but still in his strangeness , and he hoists himself out of the chair and climbs to the stage , which has a nice smell of new plywood and gives a little under his small weight . He has the indistinct sense of people shifting on the hillside           feet to applaud him . It takes eight steps to arrive at the lectern , when he turns and faces the crowd . He has been applauded before . He is used to it . No , he is not dying . Not yet . So what is it , now , that is producing this rich sensation in his throat , not of sentiment but of something entirely else ? He draws his speech from the inner pocket of his windbreaker and , unfolding the pages , presses out the crease against the edge of the lectern . The Vermont sky is gray . The air is weirdly clammy . The trees hang motionless . People are sitting down again . He looks up at them . He adjusts the microphone . Then he sees . It is the tents . That \'s what it is . The tents on the hillside , all massed together like that . Suddenly the ache in his knees is gone . Those tents on the desert , in Flagstaff -- and then he sees it all again . In an instant ,           charging desperately up the hill around the fossil pits , around the white tents standing on the hillside . And all that blood . And the rich man , and the fighter , and the painter , and the dinosaurs , and the mad Empress Constance , and the planet that was n\'t there -- It is so much . The huge , secret story that no one knows . In all its many parts , too much to tell . His granddaughter watching . He opens his mouth to speak , and the story comes back . Continues ... \n The fifth of July , they went down to the river , RL and June , sat on the rocks with a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red and talked about Taylor . The fifth of July was Taylor \'s birthday and they did this every year . He would have been fifty . RL had been his boyhood friend and June was married to him . He \'d been dead eleven years . This side channel used to be one of Taylor \'s favorite fishing spots , but five or six years before , a beer distributor from Sacramento had built a twenty-room log home right on the bank and then drove a Cat D6 into the river and piled up a wing dam , to keep his house from falling into the drink . This pushed all the current out of the side channel and into the main river . A few last big fish lurked down deep in the channel but mainly it was suckers . Still , it was a pretty spot to sit on a long evening , the shade of the tall cottonwoods slowly deepening into green water . A pretty spot if you           the rocks and watched the water trickle by , the cool splash of river water over gravel . I wish . . . said June . You wish for what ? RL asked her . I wish I had a cigarette , she said , and laughed . June smoked exactly one day a year , and this was the day . RL got one out , gave it to her , lit it . He was smoking a cigar himself . He had bought the pack specially for her . The two of them stared at the smoke as it curled through the still air . RL could just barely hear the trucks passing on the interstate , a mile away . The sound always made him lonely , the thought of all that highway , all that American night out there . These anniversaries , said June . They keep sneaking up on me . He \'s been gone , now , longer than I ever knew him . That \'s not right . No , I did the math last night . He was twenty-eight when I           . It does n\'t seem like that long but it is . Long time gone , said RL . I still , sometimes-I feel like I \'m going to walk around a corner and see him on the sidewalk . You know , just sitting around the house , and I think , maybe I \'ll give Taylor a call , see if he wants to go grab a beer . Down at the Mo Club . See if I can borrow his pickup . It \'s not like that for me , said June . Not anymore . She reached for the square bottle of whiskey and took a demure pull on it . RL admired the workings of her throat , the little hollow at the base of her neck , her fine collarbone . She was younger than Taylor and him and still quite a good-looking girl . I \'ve been going to church again lately , she said . Get the hell out of here . I \'m not kidding . Sunday morning ten o\'clock . Which one ? June blushed lightly . She was one           skin , pale or passionate . In tears she turned a blotchy red . RL had seen her in tears , not often . I \'m going to the Catholic one , said June . Weird , I know . A couple of the girls from work got me going there . They got you all signed up ? Human sacrifice in the basement and everything ? I think they quit doing that . That \'s not what I hear . It \'s safe to say that you would hate it , June said . I mean , you would hate even the good parts , which are all about doing good things and being nice to people in Central America and so on . They \'re so fucking earnest ! But , you know , that \'s what I like about them . You \'ve always had an earnest streak . And you \'ve always been a cynical bastard . With a heart as big as the great outdoors , RL said . That \'s me . No , June said . That \'s somebody else . Ten o\'clock           the sky was lit a deep dark beautiful blue with the first few stars piercing it . The air was warm when it was still and then the river would blow a cool breeze through , rustling the leaves of the cottonwoods , riffling the water . RL felt a sadness in his chest that was like music , sad music . Taylor was gone , always gone . He had lived with this sadness eleven years until the jagged edges had worn smooth , like a river rock that he held in his hand , still warm from the day . RL felt almost a pleasure in it , the pleasure of touching something indisputable and real . He remembered the feeling of sitting in the waiting room at the hospital and holding her hand and waiting , that jagged feeling torn from him . Time had changed it into something different . It \'s just like ice around my heart , he thought , a line from a song he remembered . That was n\'t it , exactly . June said , I \'ll be standing in there           old lady on either side of me and I \'ll just think , When did I turn into this ? Peaceniks and bird-watchers . Comfortable shoes , I bet . Really comfortable shoes , said June . Just then the bushes parted on the far side of the side channel , the island between them and the main branch of the river , and out into the twilight stepped a tall and serious-looking dark-headed girl with a baseball cap and a fishing pole . It was RL \'s daughter Layla , nineteen years old . In her shorts and sandals , in her long tan legs she waded the channel , water that swirled up to the hem of her shorts . She moved through the water almost silently , a fisherman \'s habit . Trout are very nervous fish , he remembered ; a line from a book . She wore a Montana Grizzlies T-shirt and a kind of necklace from which dangled her forceps , her nippers and Gink . Do any good ? RL called out . Layla came the rest of the way across the channel           because she respected them ; she did n\'t walk through their lies or shout on a quiet night . She knew where to look to spot the subtle rises . Dinks and whitefish , mostly , Layla said . They quit rising a while ago . I pulled an eighteen incher out of that seam off the bank , but that was right after we got here . Are you drunk ? Not yet , said RL . I would n\'t rule it out , though . I \'m going to go up to the house , said Layla . Oh , sit with us a minute , said June . I have n\'t seen you since Christmas . How \'s college life ? Oh , you know , said Layla . Collegy . Are you staying in the dorms next year ? Layla accepted her fate , laid her fly rod carefully against a tree and sat with them temporarily , cross-legged on the ground , ready to take flight . Me and a couple of girlfriends got a place in Ballard , said Layla . Like a little           forth to U-Dub , too , it \'s trs , trs cool until it rains . It does n\'t rain much in Seattle , does it ? It does n\'t bother you as much as you might think . I mean , jeez , it ca n\'t be worse than February around here . At least the sun breaks through once in a while . No ice-fog . Do n\'t remind me , RL said . It \'s never going to be winter again . June said , How \'s your love life ? I do n\'t know , said Layla . How \'s yours ? And this just came out of her mouth so bitter and mean that it shut them all up . June had found a sore spot but RL did n\'t know what it was . This was n\'t the kind of secret that Layla would ever share with him . It confused him , it made him sad the way that women were so closed to him . She was his daughter , his love , and yet a mystery . Layla sprang to her           , she said . I \'ll see you up at the house . She gathered her fly rod and left at once , a trail of negative ions in her wake . She had n\'t meant to blurt this out , RL thought , but once it was said , it could not be unsaid , and after that none of them knew what to do . When Layla was out of sight , June said , I \'m so sorry . I did n\'t mean to put her on the spot . It was n\'t your fault , said RL . She \'s been half impossible all summer . Something \'s going on with her . Your guess is just as good as mine , said RL . Has she seen her mom since she \'s been back ? Not that I know of . She would n\'t necessarily tell me . Dawn and I have been in kind of a bad patch lately . Is she talking to anybody at all ? RL felt a familiar unease rise in his chest , almost an anger . He knew           to Layla , or father and mother combined . People had been letting him know this since she was in the seventh grade and her mother had run off with a wildlands firefighter named Parker . There was no way to be right about this . He had stuck it out with Layla , had gone to the choir concerts and parent-teacher conferences , had taught her what he could of how to be a person . Yet every woman in the world let him know that he would never be enough . RL accepted this but he did not wish to be reminded of his failures . He had not forgotten them . June did n\'t press . RL \'s cigar had gone out and he lit it again in a fat cloud of smoke , took the square bottle of Johnnie Walker and sipped at it . They had done this once all together-him and Dawn , Taylor and June . Before Layla came at all . Again he felt that smooth sadness in his chest , for Taylor gone , for Layla , for lonely June and           river . They were going to be happy , they were going to adventure and live long and have stories to tell . Instead , he was living the same story over and over . Taylor was gone , Dawn was so unhappy that her eyes crossed from the pressure of it . Only Layla , the shy star . . . RL really did love her . There was comfort in that . Comfort also in the blue glow of the summer sky , the light finally starting to extinguish , the red glow of his cigar when he drew on it- like a red bumblebee-and the moon trying to rise out of the trees , the two of them , him and June , striped and shifting with moon shadow . Really there was no place he wanted to be except right here . Remember the time we drove up out of Great Falls heading for Glacier ? RL said . Was that you that borrowed the convertible ? Do n\'t , she said . Do n\'t what ? I \'m going to stop doing this , she           hear it . All that time he had been thinking one thing and she had been thinking something completely different . He blinked the smoke out of his eyes and said , What do you mean ? This is the last time for me , June said . I \'m not coming back next year . Taylor was a beautiful man but he \'s dead . I know that , RL said . Do n\'t you think I know that ? Well , I did n\'t . Not till a little while ago . Like you were saying before , Robert , I would turn a corner and expect him to be there , you know ? I \'d go to bed at night and half expect to find him lying there . Wake up in the middle of the night , hugging my pillow and dreaming it was him . I \'m done with that . He could n\'t read her face in the gathering dark but he saw the way she put her hand up to her throat , a thing she did when she was sad or           done . I can , she said . I am . Like turning off a faucet . No , she said . No , it \'s not like that at all . It \'s just , you know , like water on rock . It takes a while but . . . You just wake up one morning and it \'s not there anymore . I mean , I \'m not going to stop remembering him . I \'m not going to stop loving him . No . But I am going to stop acting like he \'s still here . Like he \'s going to walk through the door and everything \'s going to be OK . You have n\'t been like that , RL said . He could feel something slipping away between them and he did n\'t want it to . He said , You \'ve got your work , your friends . Oh , crap , she said . I \'ve been practicing this in my head for a week and I know it is n\'t going to come out right . Anyway . You \'re           to me and I \'ve needed you , you know that . You \'ve always been around when I needed you . But , Christ , Robert , you \'ve got Layla and Dawn and what \'s her name ; you \'ve got your business ; you \'ve got your friends and your trips to New Orleans and wherever else-you \'re a busy man . I sleep alone , Robert , almost every night . More than you want to know , I know that , but still . I \'m going to die and I know it , not too long from now , maybe , and I \'m going to die alone because everybody does . But I do n\'t want to live alone . I \'m sorry , RL said . No , see that \'s not it ! You \'ve got nothing to be sorry about-you \'re a good man , Robert ! I know I \'m not saying this right . It \'s all mixed up in my mind . They relapsed into silence then , water over rocks , a breeze in the leaves           lit one off the ash of his cigar and handed it to her . RL felt like this was not happening , an unreal moment . Anger was rising in him but he did n\'t know why or at who . Not June . Maybe himself , who had failed again somehow . He did n\'t see how . He had never meant to be enough to her , but now he saw that he was not . He had put his shoulder to the wheel but it was not enough . Whiskey , RL said , and she passed him the bottle . June said , People die from not seeing the night sky , do n\'t you think ? They do n\'t die from it . They die inside , and they do n\'t even know it . But they do n\'t die from it . They just get numb . Not me , she said . She reached over and took the bottle from his hand , then stood up from the rock and waded out into the water . RL flinched as he saw the cold           sympathetic testicular cringe of his own . He did n\'t know what she was doing . She was being dramatic , and she was not a dramatic woman . Here you are , said June . I am officially letting it go . All of it . I \'m nobody \'s widow anymore . Continues ... \n Spring 1821 , London " I predict this evening will end in ruin . " Lady Frances Lloyd , or simply Fanny to her friends , stifled a giggle . " What an utterly outrageous thing to say , " she murmured under her breath . Perhaps she was being a trifle dramatic , Sophia privately reflected . However , during her brief stay in London , she had come to dread Town balls . And she absolutely loathed being announced . In that moment , there were too many gazes judging her choice of evening dress and watching every gesture . There were too many opportunities for her to humiliate herself . " Chin up , my girl , " Griffin said , patting her gloved hand that gripped his forearm . " We are almost through . " " I detest this , " Sophia hissed softly . " Hush . " Fanny held on to Sophia \'s right arm as if she expected her friend to flee . " It is time . " " Presenting the Lady Sophia Northam . . . the Lady Frances Lloyd . . . Mr. Derrick Griffin . " Head           shadow and color that usually made little sense to her brain . Had the din in the ballroom diminished as they were announced ? Were people staring ? The unspoken questions only heightened her apprehension . " Stairs , " Fanny murmured , reminding Sophia to pay attention . " Six steps . " Earlier , Fanny and Griffin had described the layout of the ballroom in detail . With her friends \' assistance and the stylish white-and-gold walking stick that matched her dress to steady her , Sophia prayed she would not disgrace herself by tripping down the remaining three steps . " Smile , Lady Sophia , " Griffin coaxed ; his warm , steady arm was a source of great comfort . " You are stiff enough to crack into pieces . Do not tell me that you are afraid to face the ton ? " Crowds frustrated her more than frightened her . " I fear no one , " Sophia said fiercely . " An intelligent response , " Griffin said , sounding amused . " What say you , Fanny ? " Her friend           abandon you on your first evening in Town . If they dare show their faces this evening , I intend to let them feel the sting of my displeasure . " Her connection to Fanny and Griffin could be traced back to childhood . Both families had been close friends of the Northams , and they had remained steadfast even after her parents had died in what had appeared to be a tragic murder-suicide . Sophia \'s smile was genuine as she cocked her head in Fanny \'s direction . Above the shadows and annoying mist of her faulty eyes , she glimpsed that her friend had pinned up her dark hair for the ball . Sophia peered closer . " Did you curl your hair ? " " Yes . " Fanny heavily exhaled . " You will not dissuade me from speaking my mind to your wastrel brothers , Sophia . They would have happily left you to rot in the country again if they had not been persuaded by Griffin \'s parents and my own . " It was true . Her brothers , Stephan and Henry           in London this season . She had overheard her brothers cursing Fanny \'s father and debating which one of them would be saddled with the burden of escorting her about Town . Henry , in particular , lamented the expense of a sister who would never attract a husband . As far as her brother was concerned , Sophia was doomed to spend the rest of her days as a spinster . " Most brothers look upon their younger sisters as an inconvenience , " Sophia said lightly . " Stephan was just annoyed that my presence would keep him out of the card rooms . " " Ravenshaw is an arse , " Griffin muttered in her ear . " Henry , doubly so . If they do anything to upset you , let me know and I will beat them bloody on your behalf . " Sophia affectionately leaned into Griffin . " It is one of the many reasons why I adore you . " She felt Griffin stiffen as she straightened . " Something amiss ? " " Miss Roberts has arrived with her parents ,           mysterious Miss Roberts . The lady was Viscount Burrard \'s daughter . Griffin had been introduced to the eighteen-year-old young woman several days ago , and according to her friend he was smitten . At seven-and-twenty and the second son of a viscount , Griffin \'s family had high hopes that he would secure the affections of an heiress this season . Sophia did not know if Miss Roberts was an heiress , but she had certainly captivated Griffin \'s interest . " You should go and pay your respects . " His hand tightened briefly over hers . " You do not mind ? " Sophia wrinkled her nose and waved away his concerns . " I do not expect you and Fanny to watch over me all evening . I am not a helpless child . " She focused on his face and gave him a reassuring smile . " Very well . " Griffin slipped from her grasp . He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed her delicately on the knuckles before moving on to Fanny . " Wish me luck , Fanny ? "           With your roguish charm , I should be wishing Miss Roberts luck , " she said wryly . Griffin took several steps in Miss Roberts \'s direction before he stopped , pivoted , and returned . " Sophia , if Ravenshaw and Henry do not make an appearance -- " Sophia \'s face softened at his concern . " Fanny \'s parents should arrive later this evening . They will see to it that I have a way home . " " Ladies . " With an abrupt bow , Griffin disappeared into the crowd . Fanny was quiet for several minutes , making-Sophia wonder if her friend was watching Griffin \'s exchange with Miss Roberts . " Does he know ? " " I beg your pardon ? " Fanny absently replied . " Is Griffin aware that you have feelings for him ? " Sophia clarified . Her friend laughed . " I doubt it . Most gentlemen are blind when it comes to love . " Fanny sounded resigned and a little sad . " If you would prefer , we could find a quiet room --           cutting Sophia off in mid-sentence . " You are not going to hide away the entire evening . You are going to meet people , and perhaps even dance . " " Dance ? Here ? " Sophia said , trying to hide her anxiety at the notion of dancing in front of strangers . She and Fanny had taken dance lessons together , but she had only practiced with their instructor and once with Griffin . " If I humiliated myself by falling , I would never hear the end of it from Stephan and Henry . " " I do not give a farthing about your brothers \' feelings . Like most gentlemen , they both can be insensitive twits ! " Fanny said heatedly ; she was always ready to battle Stephan and Henry on Sophia \'s behalf . " You are a good friend , Fanny . " The compliment seemed to drain her friend \'s anger . " I love you , too . " Fanny sighed . " Oh , come along . I see Lord and Lady Howland up ahead . We should           amusing as yelling at your brothers , but it will have to do . " With a discerning eye , Reign surveyed the crowded ballroom and found it lacking . " Tell me , my friend , why are we not at Nox ? At the club , we have the opportunity of increasing the weight of our purses , imbibing decent brandy , and -- " " Flirting with immodest wenches , " Vane added , his blue-green eyes twinkling with humor . Reign could always count on the Earl of Vanewright to focus on the essential needs of the merry group the ton had dubbed the Lords of Vice . " Precisely ! Instead we have agreed to join Sin and his marchioness at Lord and Lady Harper \'s rather staid gathering this evening . " Nicolas Towers , Duke of Huntsley , or Hunter as he was called , overheard Reign \'s remark as he joined the two gentlemen . Side by side , Hunter and Vane could have passed for cousins . Similar in height and build , they both had straight , dark hair ,           wore his long enough to cover the nape of his neck . There was enough resemblance between the two men that Reign would not have been surprised if his friends shared a distant ancestor . Hunter grinned at his friends . " Come now , gents , you both are made of sterner stuff . An evening of dance and conversation will not cause any permanent damage . Besides , Sin is merely indulging his marchioness . Lady Sinclair \'s mother , Lady Duncombe , is good friends with Lady Harper . It would be rude to slip out too early . " Vane \'s gaze warmed with sensual heat as a fetching blonde in green strolled by the trio . The lady glanced back at them , but her elderly companion swiftly urged her charge in the opposite direction . " I can stomach the insult . " " As can I. You are only amendable to this tedious evening , Hunter , because Sin bribed you with Lord Harper \'s fine brandy , " Reign grumbled , annoyed that his friend had the audacity to flaunt his prize           , " Hunter said , smiling as he brought the glass of brandy to his lips . " If you behave , perhaps Sin can persuade Harper into unlocking his cabinet for you as well . " " I doubt Harper \'s excellent stock is worth more than an hour , " Reign said , feeling that he was being generous . More than eight years had passed since his wife \'s tragic accident . Since that fateful morning when the servants had found Beatrice \'s cold , unresponsive body at the foot of her bed , Reign had been subjected to endless speculation about his part in his wife \'s demise . It mattered little to the ton that the magistrate had declared Beatrice \'s death an unfortunate accident . His selfish wife had apparently tripped and broken her neck when her head had struck one of the bedposts . Polite society , on the other hand , thrived on rumors and scandal , and his brief marriage to his countess had provided plenty of fodder . It was one of the reasons why he avoided such gatherings .           desire to seek out another bride . " I concur , " Vane said , clapping Reign on the shoulder . " If Sin had any sense , he should -- " The earl paused as something or someone caught his attention . His fingers bit into Reign \'s shoulder as the man cursed . " What is wrong with you ? " Hunter asked , leaning back as he tried to guess the source of Vane \'s agitation . " Did one of your irate mistresses enter the room , or perhaps the lady \'s husband ? " " Burrard , " Vane said tersely . Reign flinched as he recognized the name . Viscount Burrard was Beatrice \'s father . He assumed Lady Burrard was attending the Harpers \' ball as well . " This is another reason why I abhor these quaint gatherings . There is always the chance that I will encounter my former in-laws . " Hunter grimaced in sympathy . " It has been eight years , Reign . How long are you supposed to pay for what the magistrate deduced was an accident           The Burrards believe that I murdered their daughter . I highly doubt an eternity will satisfy them . " From across the room , Lord Burrard greeted a male companion . Together they disappeared through the open doorway that led into the card room . Reign had been so focused on the viscount \'s departure that he had not noticed Lady Burrard . She stood only twenty yards from Reign and his friends . Out of respect for their loss , Reign had taken great care to avoid Beatrice \'s family . He had been aware of the Burrards \' low opinion of him , and assumed the couple was the source of the speculation that whirled about him . However , any hope of slipping unnoticed from the Harpers \' ballroom evaporated as Lady Burrard \'s horrified gaze remained on his face . The viscountess shook her head as if she had glimpsed a terrifying apparition . Several ladies circled around her in a futile attempt to calm their distressed friend . " Forget Harper \'s brandy , " Vane said , nudging Reign toward the closest door .           depends on the mischief , " said Alexius Braverton , Marquess of Sinclair , as he and his wife approached . \n STOLPESTAD Was toward the end of your shift , a Saturday , another one of those long slow lazy afternoons of summer -- sun never burning through the clouds , clouds never breaking into rain -- odometer like a clock ticking all those bored little pent-up streets and mills and tenements away . The coffee shops , the liquor stores , the laundromats , the police and fire and gas stations to pass -- this is your life , Stolpestad -- all the turns you could make in your sleep , the brickwork and shop fronts and river with its stink of carp and chokeweed , the hills swinging up free from town , all momentum and mood , roads smooth and empty , this big blue hum of cruiser past houses and lawns and long screens of trees , trees cutting open to farms and fields all contoured and high with corn , air thick and silvery , as if something was on fire somewhere -- still with us ? That sandy turnaround -- and it \'s always a question , is n\'t it ? Gon na pull over and ride back down or not ? End of           the call . It \'s Phyllis , dispatcher for the weekend , that radio crackle of her voice , and she \'s sorry for doing this to you , but a boy \'s just phoned for help with a dog . And what \'s she think you look like now , you ask , town dogcatcher ? Oh , you should be so lucky , she says , and gives the address and away we go . No siren , no speeding , just a calm quiet spin around to this kid and his dog , back to all the turns you were born to , your whole life spent along these same sad streets . Has nothing to do with this story , but there are days you idle past these houses as if to glimpse someone or something -- yourself as a boy , perhaps -- the apartments stacked with porches , the phone poles and wires and sidewalks all close and cluttered , this woman at the curb as you pull up and step out of the car . Everything gets a little worse from here ,           so much as say hello . He \'s what -- eight or nine years old -- skinny kid cutting straight to his mother . Presses himself to her side , catches his breath , his eyes going from your face to your uniform , your duty belt , his mother trying to explain what happened and where she is now , the dog , the tall grass , behind the garage , woman pointing . And the boy -- he \'s already edging away from his mother -- little stutter steps and the kid \'s halfway around the house to take you to the animal , his mother staying by the side porch as you follow toward the garage and garbage barrels out back , you and the boy wading out into the grass and scrub weeds . Sumac , old car tires , empty bottles , refrigerator door . Few more steps and there -- a small fox-colored dog -- beagle mix lying in the grass , as good as sleeping at the feet of the boy , that vertigo buzz of insects rising and falling in the heat           And you stand there and wait -- just wait -- and keep waiting , the boy not saying a word , not looking away from the dog , not doing anything except kneeling next to the animal , her legs twisted awkward behind her , grass tamped into a kind of nest where he must have squatted next to her , where this boy must have talked to her , tried to soothe her , tell her everything was all right . There \'s a steel cooking pot to one side -- water he must have carried from the kitchen -- and in the quiet the boy pulls a long stem of grass and begins to tap at the dog . The length of her muzzle , the outline of her chin , her nose , her ear -- it \'s like he \'s drawing her with the brush of grass -- and as you stand there , he pushes that feather top of grass into the corner of her eye . It \'s a streak of cruel he must have learned from someone , the boy pushing the stem           dog \'s eye opens as black and shining as glass . She bares her teeth at him , the boy painting her tongue with the tip of grass , his fingers catching the tags at her throat , the sound like ice in a drink . And it \'s work to stay quiet , is n\'t it ? Real job to let nothing happen , to just look away at the sky , to see the trees , the garage , the dog again , the nest of grass , this kid brushing the grain of her face , dog \'s mouth pulled back , quick breaths in her belly . Hours you stand there -- days -- standing there still now , are n\'t you ? And when he glances up to you , his chin \'s about to crumble , this boy about to disappear at the slightest touch , his face pale and raw and ashy . Down to one knee next to him -- and you \'re going to have to shoot this dog -- you both must realize this by now , the way she           , that sausage link of intestine under her . The boy leans forward and sweeps an ant off the dog \'s shoulder . God knows you do n\'t mean to chatter this kid into feeling better , but when he turns , you press your lips into a line and smile and ask him what her name is . He turns to the dog again -- and again you wait -- wait and watch this kid squatting hunch-curved next to the dog , your legs going needles and nails under you , the kid \'s head a strange whorl of hair as you hover above him , far above this boy , this dog , this nest , this field . And when he glances to you , it \'s a spell he \'s breaking , all of this about to become real with her name . Goliath , he says , but we call her Gully for short . And you ask if she \'s his dog . And the boy nods . Mine and my father \'s . And you touch your hand to the grass for balance           he says , Nine . And what grade is nine again ? Third . The dog \'s eyes are closed when you look -- bits of straw on her nose , her teeth yellow , strands of snot on her tongue -- nothing moving until you stand and kick the blood back into your legs , afternoon turning to evening , everything going grainy in the light . The boy dips his hand in the cooking pot and tries to give water to the dog with his fingers , sprinkling her mouth , her face , her eyes wincing . A moment passes -- and then another -- and soon you \'re brushing the dust from your knee and saying , C\'m on , let \'s get back to your mother , before she starts to worry . She appears out of the house as you approach -- out of the side door on the steps as you and the boy cross the lawn -- the boy straight to her once again , kid \'s mother drawing him close , asking was everything okay out there . And neither of           -- if you \'re standing anywhere near this yard you have to know that sooner or later she \'s going to ask if you can put this dog down for them . She \'ll ask if you \'d like some water or lemonade , if you \'d like to sit a minute , and you \'ll thank her and say no and shift your weight from one leg to the other , the woman asking what you think they should do . Maybe you \'ll take that glass of water after all , you tell her -- boy sent into the house -- woman asking if you wo n\'t just help them . Does n\'t she want to try calling a vet ? No , she tells you -- the boy out of the house with a glass of water for you -- you thanking him and taking a good long drink , the taste cool and metallic , the woman with the boy at her side , her hand on the boy \'s shoulder , both of them stiff as you hand the glass back and say thank you           has a shovel . To help bury the dog , you tell her . She unstiffens slightly , says she \'d rather the boy and his father do that when he gets home from work . In a duffel in the trunk of the cruiser is an automatic -- an M9 -- and you swap your service revolver for this Beretta of yours . No discharge , no paperwork , nothing official to report , the boy staying with his mother as you cross the yard to the brush and tall weeds in back , grasshoppers spurting up and away from you , dog smaller when you find her , as if she \'s melting , lying there , grass tamped in that same nest around her , animal as smooth as suede . A nudge with the toe of your shoe and she does n\'t move -- you standing over her with this hope that she \'s already dead -- that shrill of insects in the heat and grass as you nudge her again . You push until she comes to life , her eye opening slow and black           will be running any moment to you now , hollering for you to stop -- and again the work of holding still and listening . Hey , girl , you say , and release the safety of the gun . Deep breath , and you bend at the waist and gently touch the sight to just above the dog \'s ear , hold it there , picture how the boy will have to find her -- how they \'re going to hear the shots , how they \'re waiting , breath held -- and you slide the barrel to the dog \'s neck , to just under the collar , wounds hidden as you squeeze one sharp crack , and then another , into the animal . You know the loop from here -- the mills , the tenements , the streetlights flickering on in the dusk -- and still it \'s the long way around home , is n\'t it ? Wife and pair of boys waiting dinner for you , hundred reasons to go straight to them , but soon you \'re an hour away , buying a           pay phone to say you \'re running a little late . Another hour back to town , slow and lawful , windows open , night plush and cool , roads this smooth hum back through town for a quick stop at the Elks , couple of drinks turning into a few -- you know the kind of night -- same old crew at the bar playing cribbage , talking Red Sox , Yankees , this little dog they heard about , ha , ha , ha . Explain how word gets around in a place like this , ha , ha , ha -- how you gave the pooch a blindfold and cigarette , ha , ha , ha -- another round for everyone , three cheers for Gully -- next thing you know being eleven o\'clock and the phone behind the bar is for you . It \'s Sheila -- and she \'s saying someone \'s at the house , a man and a boy on the porch for you -- and you \'ll be right there , you tell her . Joey asks if you want another for           , and you drink this last one standing up , say good night , and push yourself out the door to the parking lot , darkness cool and clear as water , sky scattershot with stars . And as you stand by the car and open your pants and piss half-drunk against that hollow drum of the fender , it \'s like you \'ve never seen stars before , the sky some holy-shit vastness all of a sudden , you gazing your bladder empty , staring out as if the stars were suns in the black distance . Not a dream -- though it often feels like one -- streets rivering you home through the night and the dark , that pickup truck in the driveway as you pull around to the house , as if you \'ve seen or imagined or been through all of this before , or will be through it again , over and over , man under the light of the porch , transistor sound of crickets in the woods . He \'s on the steps as you \'re out of the car -- the           -- and across the wet grass you \'re asking what you can do for him . He \'s tall and ropy and down the front walk toward you , cigarette in his hand , and you \'re about to ask what \'s the problem when there \'s a click from the truck . It \'s only a door opening -- but look how jumpy you are , how relieved to see only a boy in the driveway -- kid from this afternoon cutting straight to the man , man tossing that cigarette into the grass , brushing his foot over it , apologizing for how late at night it must be . How can I help you ? You \'re a police officer , says the man , are n\'t you ? Sheila \'s out on the porch now -- light behind her -- silhouette at the rail , she \'s hugging a sweater around herself , her voice small like a girl \'s in the dark , asking if everything \'s all right , you taking a step toward the house and telling her that everything \'s fine ,           in , she should go back inside , it \'s late . She goes into the house and the man apologizes again for the hour and says he \'ll only be a minute , this man on your lawn pulling the boy to his side , their faces shadowed and smudged in the dark , man bending to say something to his son , kid saying , Yes sir , his father standing straight , saying that you helped put a dog down this afternoon . And before you even open your mouth , he \'s stepping forward and thanking you -- the man shaking your hand , saying how pleased , how grateful , how difficult it must have been -- but his tone \'s all wrong , all snaky , all salesman as he nudges his boy to give you -- and what \'s this ? Oh , he says , it \'s nothing really . But the boy \'s already handed it to you -- the dog \'s collar in your hand , leather almost warm , tags like coins -- the guy \'s voice all silk           have it , a token of appreciation , in honor of all you did for them today . It \'s a ship at sea to stand on that lawn like this -- everything swaying and off balance for you -- and before you say a word he \'s laughing as if to the trees , the man saying to put it on your mantel , maybe , or under your fucken pillow . Put it on your wife , he says , and laughs and swings around all serious and quiet to you , man saying he \'s sorry for saying that . Nice lady , he says -- and when you look the boy \'s milk-blue in the night , cold and skinny as he stands next to his father -- man telling how he made it home a little late after work that night . Was past nine by the time they got around to the dog , he says , dark when he and the boy got out to the field -- boy with the flashlight , himself with the shovel -- the man turning to the           n\'t we ? He nudges the kid -- startles him awake , it seems -- and the boy says yes . Anyway , says the man , could n\'t find her for the life of us . But then we did . Not like she was going anywhere , right ? Took us a while to dig that hole , never seen so many stones , so many broken bottles . The man turns to the house behind him , the yellow light of windows , the blade of roofline , the black of trees . He lets out a long sigh and says , What a fine place you seem to have here . You say thanks -- and then you wait -- watch for him to move at you . Any kids ? Two boys , you say . Younger or older than this guy here ? Few years younger , you tell him . He nods -- has his hand on his boy \'s shoulder -- you can see that much in the dark , can hear another sigh , man deflating slightly , his head tipping           I was saying , took us a while to get the hole dug . And when we go to take the collar , the dog tries to move away from us -- like she \'s still alive -- all this time and she \'s still alive . All those ants into her by now , imagine seeing ? He hums a breath and runs his palm over the boy \'s hair , says the vet arrived a little later , asked if we did this to the dog , made us feel where you \'re supposed to shoot an animal , slot right under the ear . He reaches his finger out to you and touches , briefly , the side of your head -- almost tender -- smell of cigarettes on his hand , your feet wet and cold in the grass , jaw wired tight , the boy and his father letting you hang there in front of them , two of them just waiting for whatever you \'ll say next to this , the man clicking his tongue , saying , Anyway , helluva a thing to           pause -- but not another word -- and he starts them back toward the truck , the man and the boy , their trails across the silver wet of the lawn , the pickup doors clicking open and banging closed -- one and then the other -- engine turning over , headlights a long sweep as they ride away , sound tapering to nothing . And in the silence , in the darkness , you stand like a thief on the lawn -- stand watching this house for signs of life -- wavering as you back gently away from the porch , away from the light of the windows , away until you \'re gone at the edge of the woods , a piece of dark within the dark , Sheila arriving to that front door , eventually , this woman calling for something to come in out of the night . Continues ... \n MARNIE MARKOV STILL had a flush of cold on her cheeks that March afternoon when Tony walked into her gift shop . Few outsiders showed up in the middle of the day before the weekend at this time of year . She sized this one up quickly . He was not a serious shopper . His cursory glance at the merchandise was not the searching look of anyone seeking a particular gift or memento . The shop held the usual assortment of shells from around the world , the lovely floats sometimes found on the local beaches , rarer now than they had been in the past , kites , souvenir sweatshirts , gift mugs decorated with whales or fir trees Marnie knew that much of the merchandise could be found in any other shop up and down the Oregon coast , but a lot of it was unique to her shop . Handblown glass items from Bepe LaRoche ; handcrafted pottery by local artisans ; jewelry made by locals . None of these held the attention of the tall man approaching .', 'He was a big man , not only tall , at least six-one or -two , but big in every dimension without appearing overweight . He walked with a limp , not bad , but noticeable .', 'The memory was so sharp , so immediate , Marnie caught the edge of the counter and gripped it hard           abruptly turned , and headed toward the alcove , which was what made her shop unique along the coast .', "The alcove was set off with a velvet rope . Beyond the rope a pale-violet silk scarf edged with exquisite lace was draped over a low table . A small placard read CREATED BY JUSTINE LINCOLN . The table was satin-smooth cherrywood , with curved legs , and a gently scalloped edge . It had its own placard : FURNITURE HANDCRAFTED BY DAVE MCADAMS . A handblown-glass wall lamp , translucent pale green , hung above it , Bepe 's work . Behind it all on the wall was a painting signed by Stef .           attention . As well it should , Marnie thought , leaving her counter to cross the shop and stand near the man .", '" That \'s a beautiful painting , " he said . " He \'s a very fine artist . "', 'His surprise did not change his expression of interest as he turned his attention back to the painting . He was n\'t surprised that a woman had done it , but that she had chosen such an unlikely name for herself . " Stef , " he said , " captured a rare mood . "', 'He turned toward her then . " Actually , I came in to get directions to Dave McAdams \'s shop . I was n\'t expecting to find a miniature art gallery . "', "He did n't look like a salesman , Marnie decided , or a thief , either . He was dressed in a lined Windbreaker , jeans , hiking shoes , and he was too tall not to be picked out of a crowd . His hair was curly , black , with a sprinkling           his eyes were dark , black or close to it . His gaze held hers steadily , not the gaze of an ax murderer . But she would call Dave , she also decided . She gave him directions .", 'The man nodded . " Thanks . " After another glance at the painting , he left .', "Stef had been a colicky baby , a poor student , too restless and impatient to sit still in class , to pay attention to anything that did n't feature her at its center . As an adult , nothing had changed . Stef was Marnie 's only child , nearing her fiftieth birthday , as unsettled now as she had been as a hormone-driven adolescent . Yet she managed to express through painting what eluded her in life .", 'DAVE MCADAMS WORKED alone , had worked alone for years after trying out two assistants decades earlier , and accustomed to solitude , he did not relish uninvited visitors . Wiry , seventy-one years old , he had sparse white hair , which was seldom seen , since his icon appeared to be an old baseball cap that had long since lost any distinguishable color or marking . What Dave liked best in life was working with beautiful wood , fruit woods , mahogany , teak , all the           planks and blocks into one beautiful and useful piece after another , each one meant to be appreciated for itself . Satiny finishes , oil patiently rubbed in over and over until he had the perfect surface that would hold up under daily use and grow lovelier with age . That day he was at his bench when the visitor knocked at his door and entered when Dave grudgingly said , " Come on in . Door \'s not locked . "', "Tony stood by the door , transfixed momentarily by a strong feeling of dj vu . The shop was so like his father 's own shop had been , it was like walking through the door into the past , expecting to see his father look up , grin , and wave toward some unfinished piece of Tony 's , as if to say , Get           Everything in the workroom was neat and clean , no piles of scraps anywhere , tools aligned on a bench or hung on a rack where they belonged . The lathe was clean . Oils , sanding papers , lacquers , varnishes , stains , all lined up , stacked up . A bench with a table saw , other saws hanging from a Peg-Board His searching look came to rest on Dave , who was holding a spindle for a chair . He did n't put it down or make any other gesture to indicate that he did n't intend to go back to smoothing out a rough spot as soon as the visitor stated his business and left .", '" Do n\'t recall putting an ad in the paper , or hanging a help-wanted sign out . "', '" My name \'s Anthony Mauricio , " Tony said , as if he had not heard a word . " Retired . I \'ll just leave this and come by to collect it in a day or two . " He was opening his duffel bag . He pulled out an object wrapped in cloth , uncovered it to reveal a box .', '" I \'ll be driving around the coast a couple of days and come back on Friday , " Tony said , again as if oblivious to Dave \'s rejection . He looked around the shop , then set the box on the bench with the table saw . " I \'ll leave my card , too , and a couple of pictures . A reference           them by the box , strode to the door , and walked out .', 'After another minute or two of handling the box , as if testing it , he picked up the card . There was his name , ANTHONY MAURICIO , under it a single line , RET . NYC POLICE DEPARTMENT , and under that another single line , REF . CAPTAIN MARK ROSINI , followed by a phone number .', "Silver Bay had a population of 922 citizens , and Will was its police force in its entirety .           a deputy , although neither man was called into action to do much more than write parking tickets . But Dave knew that Will could get some background dope on Anthony Mauricio , whom , he had come to realize , he intended to hire , if he could afford him and if he had n't left New York City under a cloud .", "USUALLY , WHEN THE days lengthened enough , Marnie walked to the shop and back home . Never in the darkest of the winter , she was too cautious for that , especially on Ridge Road , which was without any streetlamps . She and Molly Barnett split the day , Molly from nine until one , and Marnie from one until she closed at five or six , depending on customers . When business picked up , Molly came back at six and stayed until nine . On Thursday that week Marnie hung her CLOSED sign at five . A storm was blowing in with driving rain and a stiff wind , not too cold , but not good walking           , and she had called Dave to tell him she 'd be by to give him a lift . His house was next to hers up on the ridge , and he had no business walking in such weather , although left to his own devices he would have done so . At his shop , she motioned to Tipper to come along , and they hurried to the door and entered without knocking .", '" Just a couple of minutes , " Dave said , wiping a bench top with an oiled cloth that lifted fine sawdust and held it . " Have a look at what your big guy left here . " He waved toward his desk , where he had put the box , and continued on to the sink to rinse his cloth and wash his hands .', 'Marnie looked at Dave in surprise . " Just off the street like that ? Who is he ? Where \'d he come from ? "', '" Disability ? What \'s wrong with him ? " She was thinking of the limp .', "She nodded . Dave could n't abide empty chatter , and he had so little small talk it was almost as if he were retarded , or even mute at times . She would ask Will for           was hard to get him to shut up most of the time . And he would n't have been satisfied with such bare bones .", "THAT LATE AFTERNOON , and on into night until it got dark , Tony stood at the window of a motel several blocks from Dave 's shop and watched the storm . He had driven up the coast to Lincoln City and had spent a long time in Newport , where he had eaten in a restaurant overlooking the bay . Trying to see what it was that the artist Stef had seen out there had proved futile . The water was choppy , the sky gray , and blowing rain was pelting down slantwise . And now he was back in Silver Bay . He had to smile at the name of the town . There was no silver , and there was no bay , just a scooped-out bit of shore with sand on it . Even he , never having lived on a seacoast in his life , could see the marks made by high tides ,           beach . He suspected that a storm like the one that had arrived that day would claim even more of the beach .", "In Portland , he had decided to head north , see what Seattle had to offer , and if it was n't there ,           somewhere . Then , walking in downtown Portland , window-shopping , he had thought derisively , he had stopped at the showroom window of Willoughby 's Furniture store , where he had seen Dave McAdams 's furniture on display , two chairs with SOLD notices on them .", 'That day in Portland , gazing at the two chairs in the window of the furniture store had brought the first moment of clarity that he had experienced in a long time , he reflected , lying on a motel bed on the Oregon coast in a place he had never heard of less than a week before . He had gone to school , gone to law school , joined the police force , had           really wanted to do , what he was meant to do , was to work with wood , to make things , to work with his hands , and not only during a stolen hour or two now and then , with the guilt that had always followed .', "\n The Gulf of Mexico lapped at Faye Longchamp 's toes , as flawlessly blue as the water that wrapped around her home on Joyeuse Island . The waves splashed on her bare feet , blood-warm , just as they did on her own beach . The scent of salt water was as familiar as the soap smell on her husband 's neck .", 'Faye had never traveled much . There had simply been no money . Starting her own archaeological consulting firm had held the promise of frequent business trips , paid for by someone else . What could           do it ?', 'This client had just called with a change in assignment , and Faye was still trying to wrap her brain around it . Everything had changed in the days since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , though none of those changes were visible to the naked eye . Yet .', "Actually , one ripple from the offshore disaster had already reached shore -- fear . It showed on the faces of boaters at this marina , where a rented cabin served Faye as project headquarters . It showed in the reluctance of shoppers to part with money at the marina 's           the face of the marina 's manager , Manny , as he stood at the cash register and surveyed an empty restaurant .", "Joe appeared at her side . It was a comfort to remember how many times they 'd stood on their own island and looked out to sea in just this way . He leaned down to speak in her ear , so that she could hear him over the wind that whipped off the water hard enough to stir even Joe 's heavy black ponytail .", 'Ah , romance .', 'He put his lips next to her ear again , then headed for her neck . " If I get sweet potatoes , too , he \'ll sleep better ... and longer . "', 'Faye whispered , " If you get some of that microwave rice to go with it , he \'ll sleep till sunup , " and Joe was gone , making tracks to the convenience store so that they could carb-load their baby . Faye was left to watch the setting sun bleed into the sea .', '* * *', "Justine was gone . He did not miss the hospice workers trooping in and out of the house , taking her vital signs and recharging the morphine in her IV . Why in hell could n't somebody hook him up to a morphine pump ?", "Did he miss Justine herself , before the cancer erupted from her breasts and consumed the rest of her ? Steve was n't sure his memory reached back that far . He remembered the breasts . They 'd been on the small side , but soft . She 'd trembled when he touched them . Yes , he missed those . And he missed her firm little ass .", "Maybe he 'd loved her and maybe he had n't , but Steve Daigle was not the kind of man who stayed around for the hard times . Justine 's diagnosis of terminal cancer would ordinarily have sent him out the door and on his way to the next parish , but not in this case . He had an inheritance to consider . Justine had owned a piece of her late father 's houseboat , not to mention a piece of a nice little pile of stock in the oil company where he 'd worked .", 'She \'d said , "           will , so all the property he \'d owned before he married did n\'t go to his wife . It went to his natural children . This means his wife Miranda did n\'t inherit the houseboat she \'s living on , nor the stock that provides the income that pays her bills . The kids own it .

Hoping they 'd stop on the second floor , I sprawled out on the stairs and feigned sleep . In this building , drunks sleeping one off in the stairwell could n't be that unusual .", "I spun the handkerchief around so it covered my face and stood , flattened against the wall , looking around the corner at Moretti 's door . The building creaked and groaned around me . Any minute now .", "Where was he ? Had he left and I 'd somehow missed him ? Perhaps he 'd gone out the back door tonight . Perhaps he 'd spotted me . The footsteps headed off down the second-floor hallway , and it was           . I had to do something before I lost my nerve . Pulling my .32 , I crept down the hall to Moretti 's door . Light leaked out through the crack underneath . I put my ear against the flaking paint on the door and listened . The apartment was silent . I slipped the gun into my belt and tried the knob . It turned . I pushed against the door , just the slightest pressure . It began to open . Once the latch cleared the doorjamb , I pulled out the pistol again and used my worthless right hand to open the door . It swung inward , creaking , and I tensed , preparing for Moretti 's attack .", 'I tiptoed to the window and slipped my head outside . A fire escape snaked up the building only a foot away . I cursed . He must have seen me and left through the window .', "It looked like Moretti . I reached over the bed , took hold of his pomaded hair , and pulled up . His body did n't move , but his head fell back in my hand . His throat was a yawning wound , puckered tubes and bloody tissue .           half open , dull . His tongue looked out of place , a sea slug -- blue , slimy , hanging out of his gaping mouth . The floor beneath him was covered by a dark pool . I let go of the greasy hair , and his head dropped like a lead weight , thumping against the floor .", 'I had to get out of here . Now . But not like before . Not like an idiot . I needed to be sure I left no clues .', 'A door creaked . A young woman in a faded blue nightgown , her dark curls bound up in a white kerchief , leaned out the next door , a saucer of milk in her hand . Our eyes met before I was able to turn away , waiting for her door to close again . The only exit was the stairway , and I had to pass her to get there .', 'I shrugged and said , " No , " trying to disguise my voice .', 'Son of a bitch . Still keeping my face angled away from her , I shook my head .', "She had n't seen my face for long . Hoping she had n't seen it well , I pulled the handkerchief up over my face and bolted past her , down the hall to the stairway .", "          small stand of maple trees along the edge of one of Belle Isle 's grassy fields , smoking a cigarette and staring up at the stars through silhouettes of leaves . I 'd found myself wandering in this direction when I stopped running , but I was n't sure why . The cooler air off the river provided some relief from the heat , but I thought it more likely I had come here because it was a comforting place for me , filled with warm memories of time spent with Elizabeth . We 'd stood on the bridge for hours talking about our future , had walked the paths , boated in the pond , watched the buffalo graze peacefully in their pasture . Nothing bad had happened to me here , something that was getting difficult to say about most parts of Detroit .", "Could the prostitute have killed Moretti ? The wound was so deep , the cut so sure , it was hard to imagine his death being at the hand of a woman . I struggled to recall her appearance . Tall -- or at least in comparison to Moretti -- slender , a reddish tint to her hair . My impression of her clothing , green satin dress and matching hat , was of expensive fabric and a fashionable cut . She did n't necessarily have to be the killer . She could have merely let him in from the fire escape or distracted Moretti while the killer entered the           I was sunk . I would have to find the prostitute , get the truth out of her before they caught up to me . The one thing I did n't doubt is that they would come after me -- if not now , then soon . The police knew I hated Vito Adamo . The woman in the apartment next to Moretti 's had seen my face . The hallway was dim , and she saw me only for a second , but we had locked eyes . Though it had been at least six months since I was last featured in the local papers , my face was one familiar to many Detroiters . Still , at the rate new immigrants were arriving , it was anyone 's guess whether she recognized me . That she lived in Moretti 's building was in my favor . She had probably been brought into the country illegally by Vito Adamo , and would therefore be unlikely to involve herself in a police matter .", "As I thought , I massaged my dead right hand with my left , an unconscious habit I 'd picked up shortly after I left the hospital . I was n't sure if it was just a nervous tic or if , somewhere deep down , I thought if I massaged it enough , the pain would stop . I watched the fingers spread apart and then close halfway into a fist . A new wave of pain shot like lightning up my arm .", "Seven months had passed since Wesley was murdered , and I 'd gotten nowhere . Seven months of stumbling around , trying to put my life back together -- all the while trying to find Vito Adamo and his accomplices . And now my only lead had been murdered , and I was certain to be a suspect .", "The stars           dawn approached . I needed to be home before sunrise . I stood , brushed myself off , and headed back across the bridge to the city . Half an hour later I crept up the fire escape at the back of my apartment building in my stockings , just as I had exited the previous evening . I 'd had my new neighbors , Mr. and Mrs. Preston , over for dinner . When they were leaving , I 'd made a big show of going to bed early . I had thought I was being clever to set up an alibi I 'd never need .", '\n At the school in Lausanne , the Italian boarders wore silk underwear and high-heeled sandals , and painted each other \'s toenails after tea , but they crossed themselves a lot and were strict about their purity ; they were saving themselves for the men they would marry .

The Swiss girls seemed happy to be asked about local dressmakers or cafes ; the French girls , when approached to explain the rules of the subjunctive in their language , were delighted to oblige .', "Continues ... \n I was hiding in the orchard , pretending to check for creepy-crawlies rutting on the beginnings of the fruit when the Italian prisoners of war arrived , descending from the sergeant 's green Chevy : one fella tiny , nervous , prancing sideways , shaking his glossy black mane , a racehorse of a man , sixteen if he was a day ; the other bloke a walking pie safe , draped in a freakish magenta army uniform , complete with a pink blur in the buttonhole that I reckoned was an everlasting . Some prisoners . They looked more like two obscure French artists mincing along behind the curator of a museum of primitive art . The curator , my husband Toad , pointed to the house , and I imagined him saying , And over here is the Toady masterpiece The Farm House painted in a mad rush in 1935 before the wife had her first child notice the delightfully eccentric stone chimney , the listing veranda , the sunburnt children lurking under the mulberry .

Over sixty trees were in bloom , and I was busy brushing petals out of the valley of fabric between my knees , trying to breathe , because the scent of orange blossom was chokingly sweet . And the rabbits the bloody rabbits had ringbarked all the newly planted almond slips , their buds already wilting .", "I had a fairly good idea why Toad was n't taking the Italians over to the room , and even though I knew it was wrong , even though what he was planning to do to them was possibly a breach of the Geneva Convention , I waited , gurgling with delight in the lusty orchard , attacked by platoons of bees drunk on orange blossom wine . All           the sound of those baby-eaters howling when they were shoved into the sheep dip . They 'd bellyflop into the stinking , arsenic-laden waters and they 'd wonder about the greasy black pellets floating past them like mines and they 'd be picking some of the sheep shit from their eyebrows right when Toady pushed them under again with his crook .", "Oh , those men would be unhappy to be deloused the way we out here in Wyalkatchem delouse our sheep . They might even complain to the authorities at the Control Centre , but it would be worth it , because it would make a good story . It 's a story we will be telling for years .", 'He tried to remind himself that the Italians were fascist pigs , cowards , and prisoners as well , lowly slaves in the Australian hinterland , but it felt more like jealousy speaking , so he kicked the shoes back to their oily owner , and satisfied himself by thinking he had bruised the bastard things with his boot .', "After her work at the prison was done , she 'd join Clay in a diner car some urbanit had turned into a second-rate wine bar . She 'd put the wedding on hold a year ago ; now he wanted to discuss the future , reach a final decision . Because she did n't know what she wanted , she was dreading the meal the way she dreaded obligatory Sundays at church with her mother , or the therapy sessions she 'd started recently But she packed a black dress and the only tube of lipstick she owned .", 'It \'s the kind of year you keep your old shoes , she thought , passing a man in a lawn chair on the side of the road who \'d been begging as long as she could remember .

The white noise of their purring sent her to sleep feeling less alone .', '" Tacky , " her mother said , " but sooner or later you stop noticing .

The sight of her blue and inflated face took her breath away and terrified her , the suture creeping across her mouth like a strange vine . The swelling and bruising hid a reality , she knew . She tried to demolish the hope that crept up , the banal optimism that promised she could return to life as a pretty girl . The fresh injury was obvious , but in time it would heal and then the scarring would beg the question : What happened to you ? Though he waited in the hospital for three days , Lila would not let Clay into the room after the accident . He was a fire fighter and carpenter who made custom cabinets from reclaimed wood . Lila liked the way he told stories and the breakfasts he made on the weekends- French toast and scrambled eggs he got from the farm down the road from the firehouse . They \'d known each other in high school and gotten reacquainted when Lila came back home after veterinary school-her mother had given           grocery store .', '" He wants to see you , " her mother had said , taking her hand .', '" You \'re due to be married , " Lila \'s mom said .

Eventually he resorted to waiting in his truck outside of her parents \' house until she finally let him see her face , two weeks after the accident , when the stitches had come out and the           he said , taking her arm in her parents \' living room .

The more time she spent on her appearance , the more frustrated she felt . Why invest time in something so damaged ?', "She 'd never obsessed over her looks ; she 'd never had to . She was naturally pretty and had never worn much makeup or watched what she ate or taken a long time to get ready . But now that her face was altered , she felt she was walking through life relying on a different set of tools . She 'd have to depend on her smarts           always been good at her job , but now she worked longer and harder . Part of her had always assumed she 'd live a life in a partnership , with a dual income to fall back on ; now , even with Clay insisting things were fine , she began to calculate the savings she 'd need to buy a house and reach retirement on her own . Her self-confidence was as crippled as her face .", 'There was a day in the airport she remembered . She \'d seen two young girls standing behind a deaf woman and her mother . The deaf woman had a twitch . The girls made garish , frantic signs at each other and jerked their shoulders to their ears behind the woman \'s back . At the time , she \'d done nothing .

In another " document " he left his namesake a china tea set , inexpensive , but fragile , which was reduced , as we aU knew , cup by cup , in our frequent tea-drinking by the stream . And when we were plastered too . We drank everything from cups .', "They gave to each other , but suddenly stuff began to come my way , too , so I would n't feel left out . Those maniacs ! Their heads spun from the unthinkably long years of their grandfathers . They were carried away by their own vitaUty and the possibility of living forever .", 'Competing in an absurd generosity , and not doubting he \'d outlive everyone , Victor Sushkov , sitting by the fire , once gave me , just get a load of this , an " official " paper where , in his right mind and sound memory , he w ? led after his death not just any old thing , but his apartment . It seemed he no longer knew what to give . He would have given away everything . He was bursting with generosity . He just kept chuckUng . But he himself did n\'t throw anything into the bonfire , did n\'t give anything to the flame . How brave of him , do n\'t you think ? Sure , it was a trifle . Sure , not notarized . But aU the same , a document . I even teased him by holding the paper near the flame . But I did n\'t burn it           my pocket .', "Therefore it was n't worth it to hope for the square           hope . Not even to hope in secret .

Just like all of them .", "This Vas-Vasilich kept trying to rein in both Victors , if only slightly ? their game , he would say , was not good . It meant trouble . It was dangerous . Vas-Vasilich himself was much more guarded about playing around with the heavens . Also born to live long , he , on the contrary , did n't gab away his future . He cherished it . He protected it . Reticent , he had selected another tactic          ", 'And in a deliberately superstitious way , sighing and moaning , Vas-Vasilich twisted his thin , sly mouth :', "In the morning there were those venerable fishermen 's tall tales - a pike got away - half a kilo of perch - a perch was already doing somersaults on the shore ... now it 's in the grass ! ? Why do n't you tie up his hands so he would n't show how big the perch was ? We walked to the stream to check the deep-water fishing rods . The stream was narrow and poUuted , typical for the Moscow area . StUl , Victor Sushkov had two perches . And Vas-VasUich had two . And I even had three , and what huge ones !", '" You lucky son of a bitch ! " The former photographer shook his finger at me .', '" You ll pay for that piece of good luck . Ten years for each perch .

You see , his timing was off and he jumped the gun . He did it           In comparison with his grandfathers he did it way too soon . Well , these things happen .

Most likely it was a continuation ofthat game of writing beautifully composed documents ? a flirting with the future . The game always draws its players . He sat down and it was done . Not knowing exactly why . He dashed it off . Just like that .', "But now the plot began to unfold : Victor 's sister , an exemplary , respectable lady , a high school teacher , noticed a familiar handwriting that pricked her heart . A particular slope of the letters that she recognized from childhood . She read it through ? oh , so that 's what it was ! Victor , her elder brother , in his right mind and of sound memory , wrote that after his death he willed to be buried in his native Orenburzhe , in the ruined village where his grandfathers each lived to a hundred , and where for ages and ages since , there had been no houses or walls or even chimneys sticking out forlornly . But still there was a cemetery . For the time being . The remains of an old cemetery , which he , Victor , had visited with great interest about two years before .", "Victor Sergeevich even counted them the way they did it in the old days . He did n't write there were eight , or say , around ten of them . He added a postscript : the ones that were n't falling were n't many , he said . Not quite enough were left , fewer than a dozen .

But now they were struggling twofold : the loss , and on top of that the impossib ? ity of carrying out his last fooUsh , reaUy foolish , wish . They regretted that they had found this note of a w ? l altogether ? if only it had turned up a week later ! Even his sister , the greatest stickler for the rules , a teacher , a pedant and all the rest , who at first had lashed out at the others and demanded they carry out the wiU of the deceased , now even she did n't insist on it .

What ? Everyone walked around gloomy . They did n\'t look at each other : " Did we inherit at least a little something that belonged to us in the urn we finally got ? " It was almost a metaphysical question , which would at times arise and which especially aggravated the sons of Victor Sushkov , by now already grown men .

Perhaps they recognize him , but more likely they only think they do . He is wide as a boxcar and not a little frightening , this giant of a man with a scowl across his lips . He ashes his cigar into an upturned linen cap . Bigger than a bass clarinet , he says , but the people are unimpressed . In their mortifying ignorance , he realizes , they ca n't picture that instrument . Nor can they hear it . Bigger than the sea , the composer offers , and though the image strikes him as too simple , they begin to smile , these well-mannered folks who never speak ill of others and do not abuse their loved ones and are far too polite to be interesting .

It 's useless . There is nothing more terrifying than loneliness . He thinks : if I could jump inside this circle and vanish , I would . No one is listening now : space is the size of the sound I 'd like to create . There are n't enough musicians in all of New York to play it . Or enough paper to write down the score , or a hall big enough to withstand the noise . He 's really humming now .
